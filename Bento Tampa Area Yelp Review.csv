12/5/2022,5,"I've been to Bento in tallahasee before and so i had lunch here because it was familiar. The quality of the chicken itself could be better, but it was redeemable with the sauce (I had orange chicken). The rice and vegetables taste pretty nice too. I love that I could see the kitchen while I was placing my order, and I could tell where my order was (guaranteed freshness!). Quick service too."
4/13/2022,3,"Ordered:Steak & Shrimp Combo Garlic Broccoli Box with White Rice (~$18)Diet Coke (~$4)Aya's take:Although this place was super average, I'm a bit confused by the extremely low ratings. The one thing I will say is that the quality does not justify the price of the food. The portion is pretty solid, though. The box comes with a pretty well-rounded meal although a lot of it seems like ""fillers"" - things you wouldn't normally get but will eat just because it's there. I mainly ate the steak and shrimp with broccoli along with the white rice. Considering the plethora of options at this food court, I would recommend trying other places before deciding on this one."
10/17/2021,2,"I was really looking forward to eating here but food quality is not great! I'm disappointed!! I came here with a friend for the first time and there is a variety of itemsThere so I wanted to try something good and Asian food is always good. The chicken wasn't cooked as good, it was very greasy and I would say it tasted like it was old food! I will not return!"
6/20/2022,4,"Really good Chinese food! The General Tsos chicken and rice was my favorite and I would get it again. The sichuan was ok, definitely not spicy enough! I preferred the rice over the noodles. Overall good food and decent prices. 4/5 because no free water ;("
9/24/2021,4,"My volunteer group met at Armature Works because they have a huge outside seating area and in the time of Covid that's a great thing.Before our meeting I went to Bento to pick up some dinner. I went with the Korean bowl with chicken because it sounded like everything I like. It was delicious! Also, it was pretty quick too. I didn't have to wait long for it to be ready. My only complaint is they didn't have brown rice. It is listed as a choice on their website.I would definitely eat here again."
11/27/2022,2,"Food was just ok; nothing worth going back for.  Excessively greasy, vegetables not cooked correctly (Mongolian noodle bowl with steak).  Watched a colleague unwrap and pop a candy in his mouth with his gloved hand.  For a place with so many up charges, you'd expect better quality.  I have it on good authority that the restaurant in Orlando is better, so I'll try it again, but not at the Armature Works location."
10/13/2022,2,"This place wasn't terrible. If you like Panda express, don't mind paying double the price, and a $5 upcharge for fried rice, this is the place for you. Avoid our mistake and look around for better food in armature works. The food was OK but not worth the exorbitant prices. $6.50 for a drink and egg roll?"
2/20/2022,3,"Mediocre dish (I got the red curry rice bowl with veggies) at a decent price in Armature Works. Very long wait on a Sunday around 2pm, but that was my fault for coming on a Sunday!"
6/9/2022,4,"I see a lot of not the best reviews for this place but I have ordered many times, I get the same thing and I LOVE it. The Pao Pao chicken bowl with an upgrade to fried rice is so good. It has the perfect amount of sauce with it drowning. The chicken is crispy and the sauce adheres well. I got there late to pick up my online order and it was still warm when I got home. The portion generous, I saved leftovers for the next day. I'm a happy camper =]"
10/10/2021,4,Last night I tried Bentos for the first time. I liked the vegetarian options they had available. I ordered the pineapple sweet and sour tofu noodles. The tofu was fried and had a nice texture (usually places just cut it up and leave it as is). The noodles were fresh and the vegetables were crisp and not over cooked. I would compare it to Pei Wei and would definitely do it again. I didn't feel gross after eating it and will probably try the General Tso's Tofu or Korean Tofu. The food did take a while to come but it was a Saturday night and was very busy. The food came hot and freshly made. I will definitely have it again in the future. The other people in my group really liked their food too.

9/6/2022,4,"No, this isn't a place for authentic Asian food, but it's fast, and most of the food is reasonably tasty.I came with low expectations, having reviewed the yelp reviews. But I needed a quick meal close to MOSI, and I was tired of feeding American fast food to my kids.We ordered a veggie sushi roll, a kid's chicken katsu box, regular edamame, and a chicken katsu with Japanese curry bento box. The kids also got strawberry Ramune, and I had a honeydew milk tea with honey boba.The food came out as it was prepared (you order at the counter or online, but they do bring the food to your table), and the sushi came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and paid. My kids previously hadn't liked sushi, but my son decided he liked sushi on this visit. Score! There's nothing mind blowing about a veggie sushi roll, but if this was a first positive step towards more global tastebuds, I'll take it.The food overall was reasonably tasty and reasonably well made. My chicken katsu was crispy. The Japanese curry tasted correct (I'm assuming they use the same box curry blend that most people use and/or buy from MD Oriental). The noodles and green beans in the bento box were room temperature. The salad was forgettable. I'd have preferred that they not do the sugared fried potsticker wrappers as they were oily nothings that no one liked. But the rice, chicken and curry were fine.All in all, we enjoyed our meal at Bento, and my son has requested that we return. I thought the restaurant was clean, the service competent, and the prices were about right for a fast casual restaurant."
6/13/2022,4,"Based on the previous reviews, I did not have high expectations, but I actually really enjoyed my meal here. The counter person did her best to be helpful when finding out I had never been, and I appreciated the effort. I ended up ordering the sushi bento box, which came with a California roll, choice of two half rolls off the classic roll menu, some noodles, and a small salad.  I also ordered some miso soup and a fountain drink.The restaurant was clean, with a crisp, minimalistic look, and there were plenty of tables available.  I love that they had blue Powerade at their fountain, which was perfect after working out. The sushi bento box came out very quickly; the miso soup took a bit longer.The miso soup was outstanding. Very flavorful, with fresh mushrooms floating on top. The bento box was good, and though the noodles were bland, the highlights were the half Rainbow Roll and other classic roll I chose.  Not the best sushi rolls ever, but very enjoyable.I would definitely stop here again if I was in the area. Yes, it was more expensive than the average sushi restaurant's bento boxes, but it was also more convenient and quicker than going to an actual full service restaurant."
6/20/2022,5,"This location of Bento is top notch!  Very friendly staff! The food options were slightly overwhelming though because everything on the menu sounded fantastic! We got the garlic string beans, lo mein, make your own poke bowl, miso soup, orange chicken bowl, crab Rangoon, and spring rolls. EVERYTHING HIT! The spring rolls were extremely flavorful. The sauce that comes with it is not that good. Probably my least favorite part of the meal but the rolls are so good the sauce is not needed. The lo mein was spot on! Really enjoyed the build your own poke option. They have pretty much any combination you would want. If your in the area definitely go check out this location!"
12/21/2022,5,"I'm born and raised in Hawaii, when I saw Bento I got so excited!! And I was even more impressed with the quality of food. Love this place!! Will definitely be one of my favorite spots to eat!!"
5/9/2022,5,"Super worth meal with big portions, and I even had leftovers.I had the LoMein Bowl with Shrimp. It has red bell peppers, onion, bean sprouts, carrots and scallions. Natalie at the cash register was super sweet and was very knowledgeable about the menu. Pro Tip: ask the cashier their opinion or even for fan faves. Next time, I'll have to come by and try the LoMein with their fan favorite Pao Pao Chicken."
8/2/2022,3,"Dunno what it is about this place but they always take 15-30 minutes longer than advertised when you place an online order. consistently great noodles and fried rice, though. skip any of the fried meats, they're always soggy and gross."
6/5/2022,2,"Their main dishes are good but over priced to the max. I paid $15 for a main meal, some rice, noodles, noodle crackers, and undressed salad (handful of lettuce). The rice is not enough and the noodles are unseasoned. My total for this meal was $15 when I think it should be around $9. If anyone is interested in an authentic bento box, I highly recommend Sa Ri One Kitchen. Their bento boxes come with so much more and cost around $11. I understand the restaurant is a chain but I'm highly disappointed with how highly my meal cost."
11/22/2020,5,"Since Bento had their Grand opening I've been back 2 more times. All 3 times I ordered online and picked up my order. Each time I got the dragon roll with no Japanese mayo.  I'm addicted. Did you see how red the tuna was on my roll? Great quality and it didn't break the bank!I'm a sushi lover, so when I find a great affordable roll I crave it! I go to East Tampa either once a week or every other week and I always get on Fowler to get what I can't get on my side of town. Affordable sushi and poke bowls happen to be 2 of those things.So, the next time I go I have to try one of the bento boxes. Not sure if I can stay away from the dragon roll, but I have to try something else.The food is clean and delicious. service is fast, the restaurant is clean and online ordering is on point. What else can you ask for?"
10/15/2020,4,"This Bento has great setup among many Bento I have been to. Set up is very nice with indoor or outdoor dining. The elevated outdoor concrete floor serve a very good view and away from the vehicles. I have sushi box with yellowtail caliente roll and salmon roll. It come with California roll, goyoza, salad and spicy cucumber pickles. This bento box is fresh and good. The food do improve a lot from old day. My wife have bento box of chicken katsu. The chicken was two flat pieces. It also accompanied with noodle and brown rice. The salad and wonton skin also includes in the box. There is not much of service. It is order at the counter and bring a number to your table. Food was delivered by your number."
2/21/2022,1,An Asian restaurant that doesn't serve tea. Overpriced menu and it is OILY.Not to mention girls who work there are picking their scalp.SERVICE: 2.4/10AMBIENCE: 5.8/10FOOD: 2.3/10First and last.
11/6/2020,5,"I went to Bento for their grand opening today and it was amazing! Shame on anyone who came on here before their opening today and left a less than stellar review. I've been to the St. Pete location previously and loved it. So when I heard they were opening up a Tampa location I was so excited.Today I ate the Mongolian beef Bento box, the garlic edamame, fried pork dumplings, miso soup and a Thai tea with honey Boba. Everything was fantastic. The Mongolian beef had so much flavor and I loved the options that came with the Bento box. I did not have to choose between rice and noodles... I got both! The Bento box also comes with a ginger salad and cinnamon sugar wonton crisps for dessert. Every single item in the box was amazing. The garlic edamame was really good as well. The miso soup was perfect for fall-ish weather and the fried dumplings were also great. I wasn't expecting the Thai tea Boba to be as good as it was.. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one before leaving. The texture of their Boba was the perfect texture and the Thai tea was delicious.Aside from the food being stellar I thought the staff was awesome. They were very attentive all of my needs and believe me I asked for a bunch of things! While the location near USF is a 30 minute drive from my house, I will definitely be frequenting Bento in Tampa."
5/6/2022,5,"My go to is always a Build-A-Poke with salmon and tuna. Love how many different topping options there are! The fish was fresh and the rice was cooked just right. I always get the dressing on the side, that way the rice doesn't get soggy from it. Would recommend, 10/10!"
5/4/2022,5,"Ordered the Orange Chicken bento box and everything was delicious! I thought the portion size was good and had enough leftovers to bring home. Next time, I want to try their Pao Pao Chicken (their signature sauce)"
1/30/2022,3,"Kinda disappointed, food was ok. I got the orange chicken and some of the pieces were raw. We also got the rice bowl with chicken and it was good. Pretty expensive for the quality and we waitied about 35 min for the food."
12/1/2021,1,"The customer service is poor and cleanliness is below average. The cashier that took my order had a terrible attitude and handled my order unprofessionally. I also observed one of the employees use a cleaning cloth on multiple surfaces to wipe down the tables, the fountain drink dispenser, and seats. There was a delay between the time I place my order and when my food was prepared, I had to walk up to the counter get the attention of one of the cooks to inquire about my order. Only after the cashier heard me questioning the whereabouts of my food to the kitchen did she make any attempt grab my food and bring it to my table. To make matters worst the restaurant wasn't busy at all, there were only 7 patrons in the establishment counting myself. I will not be visiting the restaurant again and I wouldn't advise it to my colleagues to visit."
3/20/2021,2,"This was my first time here, and I told the cashier that and she was really nice her name was Issa. Explained the whole menu to me and was very friendly. Customer service overall was good. The food took a really long time to come out which I thought was weird because it wasn't really busy. The prices do not match the portions size. A side of fried rice was 6$ and they up charge for fried rice. They need to have a small bowl and a large bowl because the regular size bowl is way to small for 10$. The fried rice wasn't really that great quality wise. I wouldn't come here again, I will definitely just stick with the Asian mom and pop shops they are less stingy with the fried rice lol."
5/3/2022,1,Nothing ruins your Bento experience than getting to a Bento that is empty and has a 20 minute wait on the kitchen... and no boba teas available!
6/1/2022,2,Let me start this review off on a positive note. The food is really good. I recently tried the katsu noodle bowl and the mt fuji sushi. It was really good but the service not so much. I'm not sure if it's just because they were busy but this has happened the last two times I've came here. I did my order online and they gave me a time. I came to the establishment at said time. I was advised that it's coming soon. 20 minutes later I'm being told the same thing despite the fact that I did my order almost an hour ago. They are very slow when it comes to bringing out your order. It's crazy because what's the point of ordering the food online if it's not going to be ready by the time you get there. I can understand waiting another 5 or 10 minutes but 20? That's ridiculous
8/28/2021,5,"This is a delivery review.Delivery is difficult to get right. It either soggy, wet, cold, overcompensated for in some way, or just plain out terrible. Bento is hands down the best delivery order I've had (not including pizza, of course) on Uber Eats. It was delicious, appropriately sauced and arrived quickly and HOT! Good enough I wasn't sure whether to plow through or save for later. I order the veggie spring rolls and Pao Pao Bowl.  Keep it up guys it was great."
9/4/2021,4,My first time going here. It was pretty little that great for first date. I got red coconut curry it chicken n shrimp bento box. The curry was really good with little sweet but with little kick also. The chicken was tinderbox not dry. The shrimp was perfectly cooked n not rubber. Highly recommend it if your for some Southeast Asian curry.
11/29/2020,3,"I stopped here for a late lunch ona Saturday afternoon.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I had a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were sort of crispy, but very mushy inside, a sure sign they were previously frozen and reheated.  The rice bowl was tasty.  Rice was fresh, chicken cooked properly and veggies were crunchy. I may return and try some of their other options."
10/1/2020,1,"I was soooo excited to finally try this place after seeing their promotional news segment on YouTube. However, after receiving my order I was immediately underwhelmed by the  strand of hair found inside my entrée (see picture). During Covid, I trust that every restaurant establishment is aware of the necessary precautions that should be taken to ensure the safety and health of the public. Upon receiving my order from door dash, this was not the case. I give this place 5 stars for packaging, they really have honed in on providing an excellent presentation. However, I didn't want to chance the possibility of getting sick from eating my order, given the additional human hair garnishment. Needless to say, I unfortunately had to throw away my order but may try them again in the near future."
9/21/2020,5,"My eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw that there was activity at Bento when I was across the street at Blaze Pizza. It turns out that they are in a soft opening right now. From what I've already experienced I know that I am going to be a regular customer here. Bento provides a wide variety of dishes to choose from with sushi, bowls, and bento boxes being some of the many choices. You can add/remove proteins and ingredients to make your perfect dish. What I was really excited about was udon noodle soup. It's extremely difficult to find a restaurant around here that serves it with chicken. And finding one that I actually like has felt impossible. Ichiban sushi down the street on Fowler used to sell it, but they stopped years ago and now only offer a seafood variety. The udon noodles were cooked exactly how I like them and on top was some delicious chicken katsu. Honestly even though I'm looking forward to trying their other dishes if they only offered this I would be happy. The lo mein noodle bowl was a hefty serving and would be quite filling. The fried dumplings were a miss for me. They are more of the crunchy kind and the dipping sauce was spicy. That's just personal preference though and some people will prefer both of these. I can't wait to try more of their bowls and Bento boxes.Another thing that made me really excited was that they sell boba tea! Right now during covid-19 I am only getting food from places that offer curbside or delivery. My favorite boba tea place isn't doing this and I have been suffering Boba withdrawal. While it's nowhere near my favorite, I did enjoy their boba tea. They get massive points for having large paper Boba straws that did not get soggy while I was consuming my drink. I wish that we could adjust the sweetness level of our drinks because mine was sweeter than I normally would prefer. The Boba was more of a mini Boba variety, but again some people might prefer that.Right now they are delivery only during this soft opening. I had a little hiccup with their website in that it would not allow me to place an order because it said it was too close to closing time. However, I was able to use DoorDash without a problem and place an order a few minutes later. Small problems are expected during a soft opening and hopefully this is something they can work out. I think this is a great addition to the USF area!"
12/1/2020,1,"This was our first and, likely, our only visit. We ordered online but ate at the restaurant. The only thing we had that was appealing was the miso soup. It had a great umami flavor, the portion was generous, and it had plenty of tofu and seaweed. That's where the my enjoyment ended. I had the katsu bento box with steak. Calling it steak was a gross overstatement. The texture of the meat was incredibly off-putting. It was almost mushy. Aside from the color, it was not actually identifiable as beef. The order was not quite ready when we got there, yet when I tried the first bit of katsu, even the breading wasn't crisp. The only nice thing I can say about the bento box was that the rice was properly cooked, and the ginger sesame dressing on the salad had good flavor. Beyond that, a total miss.Same with the beef bulgogi bowl my husband had. We both love Korean food, but the sauce didn't even taste like bulgogi. We ordered a 4 piece roll and wakame salad, too, just so we could try different things on the menu. The roll was sloppily made, fell apart easily, and tasted utterly bland. I'd wager Publix sushi is better. As for the salad, my husband said it was ""decent.""  Not exactly a glowing review. Between food and beverages, we spent more than $60 for food that was a major disappointment. I'm not sure why or how the Yelp reviews are so complimentary."
12/7/2021,1,"Food is bearable, service is decent hence the one star. What I can't stand is how sushi rolls used to be eight dollars an hour $10 also some rolls for 1115. That's price gouging if any, you are in a student/university town. If you're going to charge this much, at least step up the quality."
4/12/2022,1,"Peak lunch and they were dead. And they are located at a great location so that should tell you something about the food. However, my review is base on sevice only because I didn't even get a chance to eat. Starving, I ordered 2 bento boxes and a roll of sushi. Came up to $63. A bit much for a single and lunch at that, but I couldnt of cared less. I just wanted to eat. Before I could even pull out my cash, the cashier gave me a disgusted look and told me they were a no cash business. Okay... I was extremely surprised because there were zero signs. I could of easily paid with my card, but this little toot made me feel as if I was behind the times. That cash was so prehistoric.  Apple pay and cards only you old hag. I was starving so I took the abuse. I reached down for my credit card only to look up and found her sitting back down at one of the booths. I walked out and walked over to Pollo Trop. They were super nice, food was good and accepted  both cash and credit. But man, they were packed! I wonder why..."
12/13/2021,1,Less than a mile from my workplace and they don't deliver.  Instead chose another company that did.  Oh well.
3/23/2021,4,"5 stars for the staff. They were so friendly and helpful! 3 stars for the food. I got the sesame stir fry and it was good but not great. The veggies were fresh, which I appreciate. The noodles were just okay. I did not care for the dressing on the salad. I'll probably go back and try the sushi and a boba tea."
6/23/2022,5,"BENTO - moved here about 5 years ago - Temple Terrace is lacking in good, consistent, and delicious food. Have not had a let alone decent but edible Asian cuisine since Chattanooga and prior to that Metro-Detroit; Toronto. Love, Asian particularly like Cantonese - Bento's Cantonese type dishes are so wonderful, prices are very good for the great high quality food and amount. FINALLY, after two long years of cooking and ordering a few really bad meals from the small selections of restaurants in Temple Terrace we have a clear winner BENTO'S EXCELLENT 10 STARS. PS not sure if there are deserts will have to check into that. We ordered: Pot Stickers; Egg Rolls; Sushi SPECIAL-MEX (order more wasabi and ginger); General Tao's Chicken and Shrimp Yellow Coconut Curry Box. YUM!"
6/18/2022,1,Went to get two rolls for lunch right around a little after they opened check out was nice and fast and was hoping to get the food at a reasonable time but from the time we ordered to actually getting the food was 30 minutes. The restaurant was pretty dead too but there were several orders that where served to a table after I had ordered mine. When I went to address my concern I wasn't even addressed until I politely made got the cashiers attention after 5 or so minutes watching the server pack to go orders. When I asked about my order she's said it would be coming out right now which made me think she forgot about my order entirely. The food isn't bad but this isn't the first time I had orders get ready 20-30 later after I ordered. A couple times I ordered to go and the time the site said it would be ready the order would take an additional 20-30 minutes. I don't usually write bad reviews but it's just been consistent with the problems I been having.
3/14/2022,1,"Decided to go to Bento sushi with my wonderful family. I was excited for my Sweet and Sour chicken. While eating I was surprised to find an excessively long pube in my first few bites. I decided to ignore the first one, however I continued to find surprise pubes spread throughout it. Overall would not recommend unless you like finding moderate to excessively long pubes in your meals. Enjoy :)"
1/4/2021,3,"I would first like to say that this rating is based only on how I feel about the menu for this location. The quality and service at Bento is always tops - five stars. I have been going to Bento restaurants (in Orlando and Gainesville) for years now so I was super excited for this Tampa location. The restaurant inside is very clean, and spacious. I had no problem dining-in, I was safely distant from other tables. They also have hand-sanitizers installed for you to use and they are following all safety Covid protocols. When it comes to their menu, it kind of looks overwhelming at first, because there are so many options for how you want your bento box, rice bowl, poke bowl, or sushi combo box. Once you get through the menu though, you will realize it's quite easy to order what you want and the staff are more than willing to help with any questions you have. The Tampa location menu offers a lot, BUT I AM TRULY SAD about this one item that is missing from the Tampa menu. It is available at other Bento locations and I always order it when I eat at Bento. The item I'm talking about is the SZECHUAN NOODLE SOUP - soy braised brisket, bok choy, scallion with ramen noodles. I even checked on Bento's official website to see if they still have this item on their menu, and they do! It's available in Orlando and other locations in FL, but not Tampa. Since I was bummed out about this item not being served at this Tampa location, it kind of dampened my mood to want to eat here. Also, I brought my mom with me to eat here for the first time and raved about how she would love the Szechuan Noodle Soup dish ( my fault for assuming this was offered at the Tampa location and not checking the menu beforehand) But not all hope was lost! They have the Spicy Donburi bowl (tuna or salmon, avocado, masago,cucumber, wakame, spicy mayo) on this Tampa menu which is one of my favorites at Bento. Also, I tried something that I've never gotten before - the Garlic Broccoli Beef Bento Box which was pretty good but I would like to try a different option next time. Honestly, the Szechuan Noodle Soup is my ultimate go-to favorite and since this Tampa location doesn't have it on their menu, I will continue to support Bento at the locations that I am used to going to in Orlando and Gainesville."
11/7/2020,5,"Have been waiting for a Bento in this area for so long! Was sad that it wasn't a full menu like the other cities - please bring the noodle soups here! This is a great go-to when you need a good, cheap, and fast Asian meal. Lots of choices! Rice bowls that we love are the pao pao chicken, general tsos, spicy korean, bulgogi, udon soup, and curry/katsu. There's not a lot of sushi choices around here, and their rolls are pretty good. Not much for sushi/sashimi choices, but you can get poke bowls and dons which are decent (DIY mini poke bowls are a good small size for me or they have premade choices like salmon dons). Mt Fuji, hot lava, and TNT are my favorite rolls! Plenty of space indoors and a few outdoor tables. Employees are wearing masks so that's good. There's also an easy ordering system when you download their app and pick up on the shelf. Takes almost 30 minutes to be ready though. Enjoy!"
11/9/2020,1,"We had food delivered from Bento by Postmates. It was awful. Tasteless teriyaki sauce, miso that only tasted like salt and the worst was the meat. I paid extra for steak but what I received was a disgusting mystery meat. It had neither the texture nor flavor of beef. It was soaked in a ton of liquid smoke flavor which made it even worse. I suspect it was some sort of vegan meat substitute.  We won't be ordering from this place again."
8/25/2021,2,"Service *Food ***Price *Value *Cleanliness ****Ambiance  ***The S O works nearby so always looking for new lunch spots and decided to try this place. As you can see from 2 stars ,not impressed! When placing our order ( Hawaiian ""poke"" style rice bowl, and a Stir fried noodlebowl), it would have been nice to have been told  at that time the noodle bowl was going to take nearly a whole hour to prepare! My wife had to go back to the office so after waiting a half an hour she inquired about the order and said we were waiting on my noodle bowl. Another 10 minutes and it has not come out , I ask this time and was told waiting for 1 thing.‍ I was offered a  complimentary ""meatless"" soup or salad but I declined , said I just wanted our food we had ordered. I asked for my wife's order so she could eat, they gave it to me and The Hawiian bowl with tuna had maybe 2 oz of tuna, 4 small cubes. Now 55 minutes after ordering my wife went in ready to ask to be refunded for the other food but it was now ready. Seriously? 55 minutes for stir fry shrimp veggies and noodles? I could have gone to China Star a block away for basically the same thing and it would have taken 10 minutes or less! And it would have been half the price ...Our 2 bowls, 1 as a combo , was 35.00!! Outrageous! I don't mind paying for great food and amazing service , but this, I am sorry to say, was neither. On the plus side the food tasted okay and the restaurant appeared to be clean. An hour for stir fry?? SMH."
9/25/2021,3,I ordered the Volcano sushi and the Sesame Stir Fry Noodle Bowl. The sushi was SUPERB. The Noodle Bowl pissed me off. The noodles were overcooked and sticking to each other at the bottom of the bowl. The other items in it were decent. I really only ate the chicken and shrimp out it because the noodles made me gag they were so mushy. So upsetting and a waste of money tbh. I would say I prefer one of the rice bowls as I had it before but my mother had an order of it this time the rice was burnt.
11/27/2020,3,My partner and I ordered takeout from the newly opened Tampa location this Friday evening. We ordered two ginger salads and two red curry katsu rice bowls. The dressing on the salad was forgotten as well as one of the curry sauces for the main dish. Although we were very dissatisfied the food we did receive was great. I know it take a while for a new business to get their bearings but I expected a little more thoroughness from this company after frequenting other locations often.
2/15/2022,3,"I enjoyed my poke bowl but I paid over $19 which is too expensive for a fast food type place. That price included a 12% tip which you feel obligated to leave when you pay with a credit card and it prompts you to tip. This always leaves a bad taste for me. I tip waiters who served me, but I don't want to tip someone for ringing up my food. For that reason I wouldn't go back."
4/5/2021,1,"Food was bland and overpriced, service was horrible, would never eat here again. Stay away!"
12/7/2021,2,"Over all the service was fine but the food was beyond not worth 60$. The miso soup was okay at best, the boba was absolute garbage. Didn't cook the boba pearls all the way through so they were hard and there was some flavor in the smoothie itself that was just odd. Overall, I should have just gone to one of my regular places but I certainly won't be wasting my money there again"
11/22/2020,5,"We had a great experience at Bentos today. We walked into a beautiful, and clean restaurant where our cashier was very helpful and personable. After sitting down to eat, we were treated with great courtesy. I was visiting my daughter who goes to USF and my other kids (22, and 25) were with me. Everyone was doing what it took to keep it clean and safe during this uncertain COVID time and I appreciated the extra care they took to keep the restaurant open.Julie Heitman"
5/8/2021,5,Good place but I wish they could have more variety of sushi it would of be so good i love the boba drinks also
4/10/2021,3,"So I like the place, SOMETIMES. The reason I say only sometimes is because I've had occasions wheee the chicken is plentiful and thick and times where a chicken box would have chicken crumbs or fat/skin breaded and fried to crispy chunks of nothing. Another thing to be prepared for when coming here is to know they only take card, no cash! This was a big surprise to me as I ordered over the phone one day and came with only cash. Would be a good heads up to mention this over the phone and posted online. What I do recommend to be good consistently are the poke bowls, I love getting steak teriyaki, shrimp and extra crab sticks for $4 it's super filling and you get to play with all the mix ins. Place is very hit or miss and service is alright, they take a good amount of time to make orders especially when busy."
5/5/2021,5,Our fave for quick and easy dinner. Order the family meal deal ahead for a party in a hurry. We always go for Pao Pao and Coconut Yellow Curry with a Japanese Bagel sushi box. 5 stars every time!
3/16/2021,4,"First time visiting Bento...I got a rice bowl w/ Teriyaki chicken, sushi and an egg roll. The hubby got steak noodle bowl, fried rice with steak and sushi. IMO I would give it a 9/10 only because my rice was cold and my husband noodles were cold other that that the food was good. The wait was about 10-15 minutes."
8/18/2021,4,"The food is good, but the service is slow. Go with plenty of time to eat. In other words, if you are thinking of popping in for a quick lunch, this is not the place."
12/29/2020,5,I was pleasantly surprised by Bento. It was my first visit and I ordered a Volcano roll (freshly delicious) and Szechuan with Chicken. The portions were great and everything was delicious.
1/2/2021,5,"Our new favorite Bento. Their Saturday night crew today was awesome. They took care of all our needs in a friendly and welcoming manner. The guy at the cash register had an especially great attitude. Food was fast, fresh, and delicious. Perfect end to a long theme park day."
3/12/2021,2,"I love bento and have eaten their food countless times, but since moving to Tampa I have been horribly disappointed. I would never leave a bad review, but I have had my order messed up every single time I have come to this location. I have had the shrimp I ordered substituted for chicken multiple times without being asked first and without getting money back (shrimp is an up charge) and they never have white sauce which is the only thing that makes their fried rice good in my opinion. I love bento but if this location doesn't improve, then they have lost my business for good."
10/18/2020,5,Our first time eating here. The place is super clean and serene. The food is fresh and just perfect. It is not overbearing with sodium like usual asian restaurants.  Definitely found a new favorite place to go.
12/30/2020,4,"Order delivery a good bit, usually spot on and pretty quick. Have had a few minor mishaps, but it happens. Will continue to order."
2/3/2021,5,Loved this place back in Orlando and glad they have one in Tampa near USF. Had the Mex roll and Mt. Muji- SO GOOD!! Also- first time I was able to actually tolerate wasabi.
11/17/2020,5,I ate there for lunch. I got a rice bowl which was fresh and absolutely amazing. The large had much more food than I could eat so there are leftovers. The staff was attentive. This was my first visit. I will be back.
10/6/2020,5,Ordered online and got my food In a timely manner. Tasted great and decent price. Will definitely be back!
3/16/2021,5,Had heard about this new restaurant on Facebook and it is awesome!  Curry was delicious. Mongolian beef was superb  and the steamed pork dumplings were some of the best we've ever had.  We can't wait to come back again!
4/9/2021,2,Just to make everyone aware.. this is not an authentic Asian  restaurant.. you will like it if you like Americanized Mall Food Court food. Not awful however it's not my cup of tea. Service was good..
12/4/2020,1,"It took 45 minutes to get our food no manager apologized for the wait. No one came and told us oh your food is taking longer I'm sorry. And people who ordered after us got there food before us. When we went to ask where our food was at the 30 minute mark they said ""working on it now"" with no apology again. We were super excited to try this place for the first time just super disappointed about customer service."
11/24/2020,2,"Food is great! This is the second time ordering. The reason for the two stars is because they forgot about my order. 30 minutes later walked in, it was not busy and people that came in after me got their orders. They did apologize but to easily forget someone's whole order, and no where near busy, is upsetting. Spent pretty much my whole lunch break waiting."
3/16/2021,1,Went here for dinner a few nights ago and my family and I witnessed a female worker being harassed by a male worker. My kids even knew what was going on and said it wasn't right. The girl served our table and was so sweet.
1/8/2021,2,"This spot was unique but the food selection was terrible. They were out of nearly everything! They ran out of dark chicken, teriyaki chicken, and brown rice, and that's only in our order. They did not offer fountain drinks and only had a few drinks in their fridge. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. Our server did not offer us our complimentary sauces and did not seem very enjoyable. They messed up my order by adding white rice instead of fried rice."
9/25/2020,4,Tried this place out tonight got the sushi combo. You get 16 pieces of average size. They also have a lot of other things poke bowls and soups and main dishes. sushi was good.I'll go back. I'd give it 41/2 but can't get it to give me a half
9/29/2020,5,Great hospitality! Everyone was great there. Food was awesome too. I got the orange chicken with ramen noodles and must say it was the best food out of any other bento locations I've been to.
4/13/2021,5,"favorite sushi in all of tampa, it's a bit pricey for the quality but oh well. the sushi is hit or miss though, if your roll isn't good one time, DONT GIVE UP ON BENTO!! THE NEXT TIME IT WILL BE BETTER! their chicken tempura roll is pretty delicious, something unique about them, pao pao bowl is yummy as well"
8/14/2022,5,"***VEGAN/ PLANT BASED REVIEW***Discovered Bento last night on DoorDash. Super appreciative that they have vegan options. Got the avo roll (without the spicy mayo), and tofu fried rice (no egg). It was delicious and super filling! I spit the entrees over two meals. Will definitely be ordering again and may even go to dine in."
7/22/2022,4,"Got a good deal through a delivery app, their bowls look good, so we ordered General Tso (breaded, fried) chicken with lo mein noodles and garlic gochujang tofu with udon noodles. Portions were great, almost a little big for me. The gochujang sauce had a beautiful heat, the one that goes in crescendo until your whole mouth (and throat) have a nice lingering burn. Not too spicy--somewhat medium high heat--but may be too much for those who don't tolerate spicy foods. For those of us who find like every single Asian restaurant tones down (or turns off!) heat for Americans, this will be a nice dish. The tofu squares were perfectly cooked, big, slightly fried, absorbing quite a bit of the sauce, and many of them! Udin noodles were the good kind of chewy.  Wish there were a bit more scallions or other veggies in addition or in lieu of the green beans and peppers, but still tasty. 5/5 to me.The General Tso's bowl, however, was somewhat disappointing. It was sweet, no heat at all. Quite a bit of sauce though. Tasted like  average Asian takeout.  My husband thought it was very good though, sp because it wasn't so greasy like many Asian lo mein takeouts.This is our 2nd or 3rd order with them and I think they are pretty consistent. Would order again!"
6/26/2022,1,Omg I haven't ordered here in a long time and I said I wasn't to anymore. I should've listened to myself. It was raining so this was the closest restaurant to my apartment. The sushi was like 90% rice. I got a very slim piece of tuna in the roll. One of the pieces was plain rice!!! Ridiculous for paying $10+ for mostly rice. Sloppy work. I also ordered the veggie udon stir fry and the sauce tasted weird and artificial. It tasted like a bunch of chemicals. I remember the garlic soy was pretty good but they definitely used a different bottle of sauce this time. It was thick and they drenched my noodles in it. I had to rinse off the sauce in a strainer when I got home. Yes. It was THAT bad. I did not enjoy my meal at all. I want a refund. It ended up going in the trash even after I rinsed off the sauce. Disgusting. Stay away.
3/27/2022,5,"Soooo good! I had the katsu box with tofu, white rice, and Japanese curry sauce with a side of spicy mayo sauce. I loved the noodles, they were so flavorful! The tofu was perfectly breaded and fried and tasted wonderfully with the curry sauce! The green beans were tasty although I did wish they would've been just a tad bit more flavorful, perhaps with a hint of garlic. The rice also paired very well with the curry sauce.I really wish I lived closer to this place because if I did, I would eat there all the time!"
3/16/2022,2,"When Bento first opened in Saint Pete, we were so thrilled :) the service was wonderful, the food was plentiful and the entire place was always clean. Even during Covid when they reopened, it was still pretty good and clean. Now, this is what they're serving for eight dollars a roll. It's a thin cut piece of salmon, not sushi, but these thinnest piece they could cut. The sushi at Lure or even Publix far surpasses it. The crab wontons are literally a no crab oily mess with just some cheese, absolutely terrible. I'm so sad about how downhill this is gone.This has nothing to do with supply demands or anything else, it's overspending, poor management and too many store openings without keeping quality control. Such a shame."
3/3/2022,5,"5 stars simply for the food itself. Location is pretty as well. I ended up ordering the pow pow chicken with rice and green beans and will definitely will be coming back for it. It was crispy sweet and creamy at the same time. I'm confident you will be addicted to it after just one bowl. The boba on the other hand is just ok. I was also not allowed to pay cash, card only at the time I visited so If you're one to use cash only I'd recommend having a card to try this gem out."
11/4/2022,4,Only found out the special from the website. Set price for 4 entrees. Decent deal
3/24/2022,2,"I have eaten here twice now and each time it has been nothing but disappointing! The food just doesn't taste fresh. It's more like a fast food place. The sauce tastes canned/bottled and so artificial.The tofu was so deep fried and hard, both times, no wonder why my friend who ate here hates tofu.If you like fast food/panda express Asian food, you might like this. Definitely not for me."
4/19/2022,2,"So disappointing.  Came in and picked up a menu at the door...we chose to order their signature udon noodle bowl with katsu chicken, the signature wok bowl, and a Hawaiian poke bowl.  But I can't write this review on any of those dishes.  Upon getting to the order/cash register, there was a laminated sheet on the counter with a lengthy list of the ingredients they were temporarily out of.  I don't know how you could order anything other than a simple sushi roll off of the menu, because the list of ingredients they were out of was so long!  No peas+carrots, onions, katsu chicken, garlic broccoli, udon noodles, veggie spring rolls, pineapple, mango, lavender lemonade...the list goes on and on.  Seriously, there is a Publix next door...couldn't management have sent one of the many employees to go buy some onion and frozen pea+carrot mix in order for their kitchen to be able to execute any of the rice dishes?   The kitchen staff couldn't have been busy cooking much of anything!  Seriously, these are staple ingredients.  I'm sure the Chinese fast food place in the next plaza wouldn't run out of the basics needed to make any fried rice. Since we had no other choice but to order sushi rolls, we did...the tnt and spicy tuna roll were ok.  Would not recommend this place."
8/23/2022,2,I had a very disappointing poke bowl.  The salmon and tuna did not taste fresh and most pieces had the silver skin still on. Toppings were lacking. The spicy pickled cucumbers were actually not pickled at all. The wonton strips taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They hardly gave me any avocado. I don't know if I'd eat this food again. There are much better options.
6/6/2022,5,"Really good sushi and bento offerings. Kids even enjoyed their boxes and were excited to try some sushi! Never eaten there before, but we WILL again!"
8/8/2022,5,Bento is my go to for sushi on a budget. It's consistently good food! They also have amazing boba and Thai tea
8/4/2021,5,This place was so good! And beautiful presentation of the very flavorful food. Very clean. Staff was friendly & helpful when trying to decide on what to order. I just wish I lived closer:(
1/25/2022,2,"Make sure you get some sort of rice with the protein. Do not get the vegetables ($2 upgrade) with the teriyaki bento bowl. I'm guessing the steam/moisture? Made it make my chicken teriyaki taste bad, rubbery, fatty.My bf got the teriyaki chicken too w rice and his bowl was good but he said the chicken used to be more charbroiled. He prefers charbroiled. He agreed mine tasted bad... when the only difference was vegetables. Place was clean and employees/manage were very helpful and pleasant."
1/3/2022,4,"I love the area around Armature Works. It is super family and pet friendly. There is great space to walk, jump on the Riverwalk, and people watch. But it is really nice to go into the historical site of Armature Works and grab a Bento box. Fresh Asian cuisine with little bits of different flavors all in one box. It has everything from your salad to your dessert in the handy little container. What a great idea, small amounts of everything you could want leading to 1 big meal. My Bento was teriyaki chicken, steamed rice, lo mein noodles, green beans, ginger salad, and to wrap up- a desert of sweet and crispy won tons. Not a bad gig. All good flavors and fresh. Service was quick. It's not a sit down - service place. Order at a window and when your beeper goes off, you pick it up. But they were fast and efficient. The building was hopping with a lot of people, but we still did not have to wait too long. Recommend giving them a try. The history of the building is quite cool, too. Spoiler alert- the building is old. LOL"
2/7/2022,4,The place was pretty good. I got the bento with beef. It was pretty good. Nice asian style drinks. Good atmosphere to hang out at.
11/23/2021,3,"Tried this spot after being out running errands. It was in a good location. The staff was courteous. I wanted the TNT roll but they were out of spicy tuna, so I got the hot lava instead. It did take about 20 for my food to come out, which seems like a long time since it was only like 3 people inside. The roll was worth the wait. It came out hot and the very tasty."
10/1/2020,3,"First time ordering from here.  Ordered through a meal delivery service.  Menu selection was decent with a pretty good description of each dish and its ingredients.I ordered the Garlic Broccoli Noodle bowl with Udon noodles, along with an order of Crunch Roll Sushi, and Veggie Spring Rolls.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a sushi fan but the Crunch Roll caught my attention.  It's a roll made up of Tuna, Krab Delite, Cream Cheese, Avacado, Eel Sauce, Spicy Mayo, and then Panko Fried.  The noodle bowl was really good and one that I would certainly get again.  The sushi roll was also good, although I would likely opt to try a different one next time.Food here was ok.  Definitely would order from here again."
3/20/2022,3,"For having experienced some pandemic related shortages while trying to order takeout here, the food is always acceptable & the service friendly."
5/26/2020,2,"Picked up dinner tonight At the 3rd St location. First off, the guy who gathered up our order was pushing his gloved hand thru his sweaty curly hair, then touching my food containers with the same hand. What happened to people with long hair wearing hair nets?When we got home they had mixed up our orders and had switched the base on them (rice vs ramen.) We didn't take it back; we were hungry. Given the lack of care tow cleanliness we will probably not go back anyway. So, after Jade's heartfelt response I decided to give it another try. I even tried to make it easy by ordering two of the same thing, except I didn't want mushrooms on one of them. Sure enough, neither one had mushrooms. As much as I dislike mushrooms, my husband loves them 10 times that. They weren't crowded, they just don't pay attention. I'm done."
2/19/2022,1,"This place was great... I used to go to the Bento in Gainesville when I was at UF so I was really excited about the St Pete location. When the St Pete location opened it was decent but has gone downhill so fast. The service takes forever and the prices have gotten completely outrageous. The quality of food has also gone down hill. Last time I was here 6 months ago I said it was the last time, but I was in a pinch with my family tonight and gave it one more try and it was a terrible experience. They were out of sushi rice, which was bummer because we came here for sushi. Then we had to order something else and it took 30+ min for the food to come out."
4/20/2022,2,"My oh my! Just take your money elsewhere. Walking up to it-pretty fresh and neat looking place. Walking in-sticky floors, cashier expecting you to order quickly as though you've been there before and know everything. The little plate of sushi wasn't worth the $11 or $14 (can't recall) I spent on it and the fried rice sesame chicken dish was just not that good either. It's almost midnight and I still can't get over the disappointment of spending $37+tip and the food was so not worth the money."
1/15/2020,3,"It was alright. Casual/fast food type of place. You order at the counter and they bring you the food.I ordered a tofu Korean rice bowl. It was ok. Flavor could have been better. It was a bit bland. Good portion sizes though. My sister had a poke bowl that she enjoyed. I've been to the locations in Gainesville as well, experiences there were just alright too.I can see how this would be popular for college students but for me it was just ok."
11/28/2019,4,"The Yellow Curry explosion I experienced with a good amount of chicken with noodles as a base was so goood and compared to the Red Curry, it wasn't nearly as spicy. For some reason when I drink, my heat tolerance is low, so the sweet coconut in the Yellow Curry was tastier to me at the moment, but both curries are outstanding. It did take +15 min. for the Red Curry to arrive at our table, so I think it could've been a shorter wait considering it wasn't busy on a Sat. afternoon. We got an order of Japanese Bagel sushi with their current promo - it's 4 pieces vs. traditional 8, but can't complain because it was free & included decent chunks of smoked salmon!I looove the modern interior design with red backsplash including the register area, which is a walk up counter (order + pay) & plenty of seating with great prices (def. would be a fantastic lunch spot if I worked in St. Pete)!"
7/3/2022,3,"The food is average. I've eaten here a lot and it's always usually the same. Not bad not great. Today I got the hot lava roll and it was super salty. I also got a bowl and it was salty, too much saucy. Just not great. I'm not sure if I'll be back. It's pretty average sushi and I'm not very impressed."
7/14/2021,3,"I've gone to Bento several times and the food is pretty good. Today I had the poke and it was tasty. My only complaint about it was the toppings could definitely be cut smaller, I've never had such big chucks of mango or cucumber in poke before. It makes it difficult to eat all mixed together with chopsticks but it's not that big of a deal. I also ordered the Bobo and that's where things went downhill. It's probably the worst boba I've ever had, most of my pieces were rock hard and hurt my jaw to chew. It's obvious they are not making fresh tapioca and it should definitely be advertised that way because for $4.50 I could get real boba."
9/9/2019,5,"Much like Bento, I am a product of the University of Florida and cut my teeth in majestic Gainesville, Florida. Bento was such a college mainstay for me that I was ecstatic when I heard they were opening in my hometown.If you've never been here before, don't expect extremely authentic cultural masterpieces or Michelin-starred cuisine. Bento does Pan-Asian fast casual and they do it well. The food here overall is fresher, less greasy, and a bit more elevated than the other Pan-Asian options we've had in Tampa Bay.I'm a big fan of the surf-and-turf don. The katsu is crispy and makes for such a nice texture against the tuna sashimi. It comes with a drizzle of their famous (and secretly recipe) spicy mayo and avocado pieces along with a side of wakame aka seaweed salad.Another must-get for me from Bento is the spicy cream chicken! Perfect mashup of spicy, creamy, and savory. Definitely not macro friendly but it's such a worthwhile splurge.I was also impressed with this Bento's store design. The lines are extremely clean and the restaurant is nice and airy, letting that famous St. Pete sunshine in. It actually reminds me a lot of the restaurants I saw on high streets backpacking through Seoul, Hong Kong, and Singapore.TL;DR: Bento does Americanized Pan-Asian food and does it really well. Get the surf-and-turf don or the spicy cream chicken. Restaurant itself is sleek and IG-worthy."
2/19/2022,3,Great food. Waited an hour for a simple order. It was annoying watching to go orders fly out while sitting and waiting.
2/14/2022,2,My wife and I came here for lunch and it was okay.  She got a sushi roll and I had a poke bowl and we split a couple of side.  There was not much flavor in anything.  I was amazed at how expensive this place is.  With tip we paid over $90 for a very mediocre lunch.
7/13/2021,4,"We ordered the Surf n Turf with Katsu and the Spicy Donburi with salmon in the late afternoon, and both came out so well, the tonkatsu was tossed on a little carelessly presentation-wise, but it still tasted great! The cucumber was so fresh and crunchy, and the salmon was so toro toro. The miso soup was also so good and warm, perfect for a rainy day, but we were a bit surprised when it came in a plastic container.I was a little thrown off by the name too, since for a restaurant named Bento, there was only one bento choice. In all honesty, I think they'd profit more if they advertised more for their bowls rather than bento haha! The workers were so nice, and the wait wasn't too long!It is also really clean and neat! I loved it!(also at the fountain, they have an own faucet for water instead of it being a tiny button under the lemonade category yknow what I mean? I love my water not getting mixed with lemonade)"
8/3/2020,2,"Got the general Tso bento box, side of lo mein, veggie spring rolls. Presentation was great but after you start getting into it, I'm not sure why I bought it. I don't really know what I was expecting but honestly tasted like a Panda Express. Like a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall but somehow not as good? The general Tso sauce was salty and it was more like a soup than a sauce. I liked the idea of having a salad but that also was drown in peanut sauce dressing. The lo mein was greasy, the rice was dry. The deep fried sugar dumpling triangles were pretty good and so were the spring rolls. Would try again but I think I would skip bento box or anything that that comes at your neighborhood Chinese place. Idono, I just think if your calling yourself bento box, that should be the star of the show."
2/10/2022,4,Staff was amazing and food was so good. First time going will definitely return. Weird it's by a Publix but who cares it's still good
10/3/2020,5,So delicious!!!! Everything fresh!!! Cooked perfectly!! Nice portion! Ordered thru Uber eats! Food arrived hot! Love this place...
7/25/2021,1,"My friend and I were so excited about trying something new. This place totally disappointed us. The food taste like Asian food from the mall. Well...to be honest mall food taste a lot better than this place. The prices was extremely high for the quality of food. The food was cold, over cooked and lifeless. It was exciting to eat from a bento box and use chopsticks but that was the ONLY excitement. Don't waste your money here. I spent $25 for a Bento Box meal and added an egg roll. I wish I could get a refund. Never going again."
9/8/2020,4,"This is the 5th bento location I have ordered from in FL. The first time I ordered they forgot my boba tea and sauces, even though they charged me for them. From looking at the other reviews, it seems like this particular location has a hard time fulfilling orders so I would recommend always double checking your bag if you are picking up. The second time everything was great and the food was fresh.I recommend trying the sriracha garlic chicken bowl with lo mein, as well as the rainbow and mt fuji rolls.I do not recommend the pad thai."
10/30/2021,1,"After sitting on the order for 30 mins each time, You've canceled my order 3 times in a row via delivery service, over just a month. Get off the app if you don't want to use the delivery service. Horrible. I used to be a regular."
5/27/2021,3,"The food would have been great, if it was warm..I came in here with my family the other night. We ordered a good amount of food, including:-A noodle bowl teriyaki style with chicken-a chicken and rice bowl -miso soups-snow peas The soup was very good. It was very warm with little squares of tofu and mushroom in it. The broth was mild, but rich enough for the Happy Hour special they were having. The happy hour meant that you could get a free side if you ordered between a certain time. The noodles and chicken were both lukewarm at best. I question if they ever went into a wok or some sort of heating apparatus at all. The chicken was very good! It was tender, and had skin on giving a very authentic feel. However, it was also room temperature. I even dug around my bowl a little, thinking that I'd find some hot noodles in the center just to taste. Nothing. The whole bowl was just room temperature. Had this been takeout, I would have chalked the lack of warmth to the fact that I had to drive home. This wasn't the case. I ate these noodles In the Store in their lovely big bowls. Heat can really change flavor profile, and it tasted subpar without any kind of physical warmth. For the money we paid, I really wish it had been at least mildly hot... I won't be back."
3/6/2020,4,"I received a gift card after my last review and used that today. I ordered the same thing as last time I was there and my take out food wasn't very good. This meal I decided to dine in. All the food was hot and fresh, I was in around noon. However they didn't listen to my order and my food was on rice and missing the red peppers. I ordered it without green peppers, I still wanted the red. Decent price for fresh made food."
11/1/2018,3,"It is a fast food joint. Order and paid at counter. Nothing fancy. Just like mall food. Except more personal touch with cooking after order. Seem like fried rice and noodle being pre-cook for assembly. I hope for Bento to be here at Bay Area and now they are here which has not impress me. The best thing about this place is their bento box with many items and reasonable price. I would come back lack of time to eat but not for date night. We got the Korean beef and the Katsu bento box. The Korean beef did not fare well. But the katsu is good. The string beans has no salt in the bento box. We also got the spicy tuna small with 4 pieces. This item is a bit expensive. However, it has good flavor. We got the boba tea which is fun to have. Something I don't understand is when you paid and order at counter, the alway have a tip box to check for 18% to 20%. The only service is bring the food on table. That always doesn't make sense for cafeteria type food service industry."
10/6/2018,4,"Very good and brand spanking new. Bento Cafe is a Florida chain and I see they like to be close to college towns. I've been to a Bento Cafe years ago in Gainesville and I was excited to see an opening here.They have bowls with noodles, rice, veggies, they have bento boxes with sushi rolls or other rice and noodle options with beef, steak, and chicken. They have sides like egg rolls, dumplings, Wakame salad, and crab Rangoon. There r definitely options for meat eaters and veggie eaters. Prices r a step lower than usual which is nice probably bc it's close to USF St. Pete.They also have boba drinks too!Free parking for an with validation is available. Parking lot on 2nd street. They also have about 6-8 outside tables - dog friendly after you are coming back from the Farmers Market!"
4/28/2022,5,Ordered sushi for delivery and it was delicious! I got the florida roll and the spicy tuna roll! I would recommend this place! The only thing they forgot in our Togo order was missing chop sticks. All in all good experience and great food!
10/7/2018,5,"I'm a fan. Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi (Bento Café on FB) is a smaller chain of restaurants based in Florida, currently consisting of ten locations. Don't let the word ""chain"" prevent you from dining here. We were pleasantly surprised with our recent visit. After we placed our menu choices with the cashier, the whole order process was quick and efficient. The wait for our meal was minimal. We started with the Pork Egg Rolls and then chose the Mongolian Beef Bento Box and the Japanese Curry Katsu Noodle Bowl as our entrées. Everything was delicious and the generous portions were a great value.There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available and the staff was pleasant to deal with. As with most DTSP restaurants and bars, street parking is minimal. Patrons can park in the attached Camden Pier Garage for a limited time. We are placing this restaurant in our repertoire and will be back to try more items on their menu."
10/1/2018,5,"Gainesville, Jacksonville, Orlando, Davie... and now FINALLY St. Petersburg!Bento Cafe has finally landed in the Tampa/DTSP area.  Located on Third  Street South, Bento serves cooked foods and sushi in a fast casual setting.  You order your food with the cashier, get a number, grab your seat, and a server brings your food right to your table.  You can place an order to-go if you're on the move.  You can also call ahead and place an order for pickup.I've been eating Bento since my college days in UF.  It's nice to see them taking over Florida and never losing their quality taste or quick service.I ordered my usual build-your-own poke bowl.  They have 3 sizes: mini, regular, and large.  The regular has 2 proteins + 1 base (white rice, brown rice, or greens) + 4 mix-ins + 2 toppings.  For $11, you get a good sized portion of ingredients made to your specific liking.I also ordered a boba milk tea, which is just average in my opinion.  It is now one of the few places in DTSP where you can order boba tea quickly to-go.There is indoor and outdoor seating.  Although it was just a soft open, the servers were quick to clean vacated tables so new customers could sit right away.  I imagine that during peak hours, it will get crowded quickly.If you are craving some good pan-Asian cuisine, definitely check out Bento Cafe."
9/17/2021,2,"The sushi here was among the worst I've ever had. The rolls fell apart as I ate them, the rice was cold, and the rolls without sauce tasted like supermarket sushi. The worst part, though, is that the rice was undercooked and semi-chewy/semi-crunchy. It was mostly inedible. Maybe the noodle dishes are more palatable, but stay away from the sushi!The other reviews saying it tasted like mall or fast food restaurants are spot on. I won't be back."
3/6/2019,5,"I love love love the amount of choices this place has for our picking! For my first time I tried the Bento Box with sesame soy chicken! The bento box included rice, lo mein, a ginger salad and some little wonton triangles. Super good and very filling! We got spring rolls to share - 3 per order which is different than most places that have 4. But none the less - very good! My boyfriend got a orange chicken noodle bowl and a flying dragon roll. We were both stuffed to a brim but not enough to not drink our boba teas!For the boba we tried a mix for each of us. One milk tea chocolate taro mix and a pineapple mango blended ice tea! Both were great and gave us a sugar buzz for sure.Overall this place is great and I will be returning! I and excited to try out other options they offer"
10/3/2019,5,"It's always a treat when I eat at Bento. As a recent UF grad, I'm much more familiar with the Archer and Newberry Rd locations in Gainesville. Today I stopped in and grabbed a Red Dragon roll for lunch and added eel sauce to it. If I'm being honest, I looked up the contents of a roll I often pick up from a different sushi restaurant and found the closest thing on Bento's menu. It was good! There was a bit of a wait for my takeout order, but it was peak lunch time so it was to be expected. I usually get pao pao chicken bowls or poke bowls from here. I've had their ginger salad before too. All are fair game. Love Bento!"
10/27/2020,2,"This Bento is so hit or miss it is painful to make a visit here. When this location first opened I went once a week. They had great happy hour specials and the food always came out within 10 minutes. I am not sure what has happened but ever since Covid began they ended happy hour specials  and their food quality, speed of service, and customer service has all greatly declined. I stopped going because one time my chicken stir fry took 30 minutes to make. When I asked the rep what happened she gave me a very short answer and did not even apologize for my wait. Then last week I received some coupons in the mail and decided to try it again. To my disappointment I quickly found out nothing has gotten better. Even though it only took 22 minutes for my order to come out the quality was terrible. I got the chicken stir fry bento box. There was barely any chicken, the rice was hard, the salad was soaked in dressing, the green beans were soggy, and the noodles were Tasteless. I understand covid precautions take precedent and I don't mind waiting a little bit longer now a days and I understand they need to make up the money they lost but eliminating happy hour but it doesn't mean quality and customer service need to suffer. I really do enjoy Bento and their crab wontons are the best in town but I don't believe I can continue to go back to this location until they start to make their customers a priority."
10/13/2018,5,"This newly opened (Oct 2018) quick/casual restaurant just opened under the retail space in Camden Pier District's retail space. The space is modern, clean and conveniently located. Service was fantastic and all the employees were super friendly and willing to accommodate. They have many vegan and vegetarian options and are very open and transparent about their menu. I wanted nigiri and sashimi but it wasn't listed on their menu, so I asked about it and they showed me a ""secret menu"" where they had their options listed. It came about 7 minutes after we ordered which was super quick!  The quality of my smoked salmon and eel nigiri was fantastic and it was very fresh. My friends ordered the chicken pad Thai and chicken with udon noodles. They both raved about their meals. I would definitely come back here again and I love how versatile the menu is."
11/8/2021,3,"The place looked clean and although it was empty, the staff was very busy.  It seems like they were filling many take out orders.  It took a very long time to get a simple order of sushi.  Other than the wait it was a decent experience."
7/2/2021,1,When did COMMON SENSE go out the window. We used to love Bentos now this is what they serve because they are out of ingredients they could easily get at the Publix next door. Sad to see. You just lost 2 long time customers. Good Luck!
4/21/2021,2,"I used to love bento so much and worked there when they only had like 2 locations. Since then I've been disappointed as the quality of their food seemed have an inverse relationship with their growth. They used to have a good portion of the side of beans that come along with their bowls and now they put 3 as a garnish. The price has increased as well with smaller meat and veggie portions so it doesn't make sense. I ordered a matcha milk tea and found several crumbs of what I think is burned boba mixed in, making the drink inedible. I've given it a shot time and time again but this may be my last visit."
11/13/2019,4,"Updated review on 11-13-2019: Because I found the food so good at Bento, I've now revisited another 6 or so times. Food is still excellent and a very good value, and the staff have been fine. I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars (up from 3). Consistency could still be better, and the staff could still be 'happier' and more engaging, but overall I love eating here.Original review:Food was excellent (yellow curry lo mein bowl and pork dumplings), but the counter girl/order taker was terrible-arms folded, leaning on counter, and a look of total displeasure at having to be at work. And she mumbled and I had to ask her repeatedly to repeat what she was asking. This was so off putting that I deduced 2 stars. Hopefully it was just this one employee."
6/18/2021,2,I understand restaurants are struggling so I recommend you order ahead of time. It looked like they had a decent amount of staff but It took a half hour to get my order. I only got a small salad and the cucumbers were bad. Won't stop me from going back because i like the food but I will definitely order ahead. Just hope they will get back to having better service.
6/17/2019,4,"The place was nice and clean, cashier and waiter were friendly, the food was good but just a few things about my order left me slightly bummed. First off, you can order an entree from their ""From The Kitchen"" section or ""Sushi/Build-Your-Poke Bowl"" section. ""From the Kitchen"" section give you few types of bases: Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or their Bento Box. They have a Kids Bowl option too, so extra points for that! For their ""Sushi"" section, they have a huge variety of signature rolls and some poke bowls. I ordered their bento box because I felt given their name, the bento box would be the star of the show. However, I'm not sure if it was just my order, but they could've honestly improved it. I ordered the Pao Pao Spicy Cream as my entree selection. With this entree, you have an option to choose if you wanted Pao Pao Spicy Cream with either chicken, tofu, or shrimp. I chose the shrimp and these are honestly to die for! Their sauce is amazing and so delicious. It's almost like a honey walnut sauce but spicy. While the main entree was great, the sides were a little disappointing. The salad I had was drenched in their ginger salad dressing which tasted a little bit too salty for my liking. Also, because it was a lot of dressing, it really made the greens soggy. The dressing was just too watery. Also, I was not a fan of their Lo Mein noodles. It was cooked in a potent type of oil or sauce (maybe too much sesame oil?) that just did not tasted appealing. The rest of the sides on the bento box such as the green beans, the white rice, and fried wontons with a white sauce (I'm assuming it's condensed milk), were all cooked perfectly and tasty! Ohh and try out their Krab Wontons- it was really crispy and yummy! Overall, still a good place to try out! I would still go back to try out the other foods on the menu but because it was my first time time here, I wished my order could've been better."
1/13/2022,3,Love the food here but they ALWAYS give different portions sizes. sometimes i will order double meat and it comes out to a smaller portion than if i just ordered a regular portion. ALSO. don't expect to get your food quickly. i ordered to go food on my food and waited 20 minutes before coming inside to pick it up. when i got inside the lady at the counter told me my ticket JUST came through and it will be another 20 minutes. doesn't make sense to me why the machine doesn't print my ticket for 20 minutes after my order was placed.
6/5/2021,5,Amazing delivery - everything was fresh& tasted amazing! I got a poke bowl and my boyfriend ordered the Schezuapn spicy bowl - both great plus the dumplings and spring rolls we shared. Will definitely order again!
11/7/2021,2,The dinners we ordered were okay but the staff were overwhelmed with the number of orders and were way behind schedule. My order was supposed to be ready in a half after after ordering but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes at the restaurant because the order was not completed. This is not the first time we (and our hungry toddler) have had to wait--Just beware that pickups around 6-7:30 often run late.
12/30/2020,2,"Unfortunately I have to update my latest review. I ordered the poke bowl with chilled sesame noodles. The noodles were drenched in a congealed sauce, it was so thick it layered the bottom of the bowl. I'm actually kinda worried they were really old, and I'm gonna get sick."
6/26/2021,5,"I bumped up my rating, manager reached out to me. I think that shows seriousness and appreciated it.Food tastes great but way overpriced and super slow. Ordered katsu rice bowl and a sushi roll. There was one other table in restaurant. I feel the issue is they get a lot of take out orders and like many places, tend to devote their time to serving mobile requests and not the customers in the store. Plus spent almost $30 for a rice bowl and sushi roll. Little crazy. Rice bowl came out first. The roll took almost 20 mins more. Very disappointed."
8/25/2020,1,First time ordering online lunch for pick up The website promises a 15% discount for first time online orderCompany did. Not give the discount at check out even after using the code as suggested Very unethical in my opinion to bait and switch
2/27/2019,4,My perfect curry. O how I've searched for thee! The Japanese Curry is a brown savory curry with umami out the wazoo and has just a bit of a kick to get your sinuses buzzing. Even though I was full I wanted to order more rice so I could soak up every last drop. It's a little salty but the jasmine rice balances it out well and I don't know if I'll ever order anything else because I know nothing can compare.
5/14/2019,5,It was so goodA little pricey but worth it. We tried 2 different things and are looking forward to going again!
3/24/2019,4,"Bento is a great spot throughout Florida for a quick pan-Asian bite! Their menu selection is pretty inclusive of typical meals like pad thai, katsu, udon, rice bowls, bento boxes, etc.  Depending on time of day, this place can be pretty busy!  Don't get caught parking in the Publix parking lot or you could get towed.Value - priced well. You get a good amount of food in the bowls and a good variety in the bento box to make it worth.My recommends - Pineapple fried rice, Spicy Cream chicken/tofu/shrimp...now called Pao Pao, pad thai, and curry katsu!  If you want something a bit more fresh I would recommend the Chirashi bowl!  The service is typically great and quick!"
11/18/2021,4,My boyfriend and I used to order from Bento basically weekly to get poke bowls and he still loves it but i'm so sad I can't find your teriyaki steak on your menu anymore! Please bring it back!
4/8/2019,4,"I have a love for poke bowls so I had to try out Bento! I ordered my bowl, it came out perfect. I was there for lunch and got a mini, which was a perfect size for me to be full but not overstuffed. Everything was fresh and delicious. I am a huge fan of the size into OK no because as I said the mini was perfect size and with tax around 7.50, I love pacific counter which is also downtown but the bowls are way too big and this way I save money and don't waste food, not to mention the fish seemed more fresh and the sauce options were better here. I'll definitely be back. I chose 4/5 because the service was a little iffy/rude, if it was just based on food I would have chosen 5/5."
6/9/2021,5,Wonderful and convenient place to get a quick lunch. Right downtown with ink walking distance. Food was excellent staff even better.
11/8/2021,5,"I have never been to Bento before however just having moved to the area I was excited to try it. We ordered sushi, apps and 4 meals. The food was delicious and I was so impressed with the service. However, I did have a couple issues with my order at first. The red headed Manager, I believe her name is Ashley, couldn't have been nicer and more willing to help correct it. She was super friendly and understanding and turned an inconvenience into a pleasurable experience. I was quite impressed with the customer service. Great service and great food!"
3/17/2021,2,"My family and I went here for lunch and it was not great...at all. It was our first (and last) time ever. Shortly after arriving, (again first timers) we asked an employee a question which was rudely (and quickly) answered that they couldn't help us and to ask the cashier. They have an extremely abbreviated menu (which we could deal with given the pandemic and has no impact on the rating) but $96 dollars later, my bf was served his General Tso's chicken and shrimp way under cooked. It actually made him physically ill! Not happening again!"
11/8/2018,5,"I first had Bentos when I was in college in Gainesville,FL.   Over the years I've had a chance to also try their Jacksonville and Orlando locations.   I am so excited that we now have one of our own locations in St.Pete.It's located right next to the Simple Greek and is very close the All Children's Hospital.  The ambiance is nice for this type of restaurant and it is very clean.   I usually get their bento box and change up the main dish frequently so I get a variety of flavors. However,  they have so many more options as well.  There is some street parking right in front. Overall,  their quality and consistency of food compared to all their locations is great. I love when a franchise can keep the same standards at every restaurant. I will continue to recommend this place for anyone that wants a relatively quick bite to eat and will be coming back often!!!"
11/26/2018,4,"Quick, delicious option in downtown St. Pete. I stopped in for a bento box that came with chicken, rice, noodles, ginger salad and crispy wonton dessert. Everything in the box was great. I also ordered garlic edamame, which I would not order again. I was hoping the Garlic edamame would be a saucy garlic edamame but it was just edamame tossed in minced garlic. At that point, I prefer soy sauce and salt. I ordered a boba and was shocked to learn their teas were sweetened so I sent it back and returned it for a Thai tea."
11/9/2018,4,Nice open space with outside seating. Grab a menu as you walk in to pick your order. Lots of really good choices!  Even though I love tonkatsu I opted for the pineapple Thai fried rice.  The chicken had a nice flavor and was very tender but it was just ok. Got some pork egg rolls as well. I liked these a lot. They were not as heavily breaded as some I have had. Overall nothing really wow'd me but it was not bad by any means.
1/7/2019,4,"Stopped in here for lunch today - if you can find parking it's definitely a nice place to stop in while on a lunch break. That was our biggest problem, finding parking. We ended up in the Publix lot next door after circling around it for about 10 mins. Beforehand we were circling the blocks at least 3 times with no luck on street parking. Once we got parked & made it to the restaurant, we saw a sign saying free 1 hour parking in the garage behind them, but it was such a tiny print that anyone from the road wouldn't've seen it. As for the food, some of the freshest fast food seafood I've had. My boyfriend got a spicy tuna roll & I had a mini custom poke bowl also with tuna; both were super tasty, but the roll was smaller than what we get at other places like Rollbotto and Locale. We also split a Terriyaki pork noodle bowl & it was incredibly tasty! It was also quite a big portion, so if ordering it I'd suggest splitting it with someone or making sure you're going in quite hungry. The waitstaff was all super nice too and very welcoming. It was nice and modern inside, cleaned well, & there was outdoor seating too which we'll probably take advantage of next time. So if you can find parking, by all means check out this new place downtown!"
10/25/2018,5,"Finally Bento comes to St. Pete! What an amazing location.I had the pleasure of joining in on the Open Media Night  and oh my was it a blast! Their sushi was just so vibrant and the atmosphere is amazing. The place is cool, the food is AMAZING every bite was better then the last.Great place for lunch in the area. Their options vary from bentos, to sushi, to build your own poke, amazing appetizers and boba! Come check it out for yourself!"
10/25/2018,5,"Bento did a great job on meeting my expectation just as much as the original place where they first opened in Gainesville. I bragged to my friend how their food is good quality. She was hesitant to try the food, but she was impressed with the taste, price, and what's even better is the convenience to the location close by to her job . The chicken teriyaki was tasty, the portions was perfect. She had to take some home because she wasn't able to finish it. My orange chicken wasn't dry. I shall meet up with her again future lunches."
10/5/2018,5,"This is our 4th time eating here in the two weeks it has been open and we love it. Bento is still in soft opening but they are doing an amazing job to serve great pan-Asian fast casual food. Thank you for coming to downtown St. Pete!We are vegetarians and they have a great tofu selection on almost every dish. The fried rice, the tofu bento box, the pad Thai have all been great. Our friends have all said they love it as well. The atmosphere is casual and modern, the service is friendly and the prices are very reasonable. We love Bento!"
11/16/2018,5,"I really liked the Japanese Curry Katsu with pork on Lo Mein Noodles. There is a lot of meat that comes with the order. There could be more noodles and less meat in my opinion, but it will fill you up. I didn't finish the meal the three times I ordered it. I ate there at lunch. Then I went back to get To Go at dinner. Then my friend picked it up for me the next time before we left town. I had it two days in a row. I did order extra gravy the third time since I love to soak it all in curry and there wasn't as much in the To Go order as when I ate there. I wish there was a location close to where I live. The strawberry ice drink I had was really good. The thai tea was just ok. I really recommend the place. The price is decent too. The employees are nice."
11/15/2018,5,"The sushi and bento boxes here are excellent. This is my go-to spot for Uber Eats, too. The staff is friendly and you can tell they genuinely are enjoying their new spot in St. Pete!"
9/18/2019,5,"I originally found this place returning home from a road trip in Gainesville. My college roommates were from Jacksonville and talked non stop about it so I had to try it. Between locations, they are very consistent. Although I remember them having more options in Gainesville, especially when it comes to boba, the food is delicious. The restaurants are always clean and have plenty of space. This location has parking in the garage but you do need to ask for a parking pass before you walk out of the restaurant or it is $5 to get out of the garage. There are also a few spaces on the street that are parallel.When you first walk in, they have plenty of menus to look at (the menu is not on the wall.) The staff is also quick to greet and help and check you out. They offer plenty of sushi, build-a-poke bowls and various rice and noodle combinations. My favorite is to ask for a bento box. It typically comes with a protein, white or brown rice, ginger salad, lo mein and string beans. I have also had a poke bowl from here. They allow you to personalize it and they it laid out on the menu to make it easier to order.  They have plently of protein options and do also offer tofu as a selection. One time I was there, they were out of it, but every other time I have gone, they have had all proteins. The sushi is good and usually is served as 4 or 8 pieces. I wouldn't personally recommend getting the boba. It is okay, but seems to be pre-made. Everything I have gotten has been fresh, hot and worth the price. They also have quite a few sauces to choose from but you do have to ask, they will not just give them to you.There are typically chopsticks on the table and the plastic silverware is closer to the drink station.They have two nice single use bathrooms inside the restaurant towards the back of the restaurant. They also allow dogs on the patio. Seating is first-come, first-serve."
2/18/2021,5,Great quality sushi! Loveeeee that the straws were paper. I very much so support limiting plastic. Can't wait to try other dishes.
12/6/2019,1,"Prior to going to this restaurant, we studied the menu online and decided it sounded like it would have vegan options. When it came time to order at the counter my husband asked what exactly was in the Veggie Spring rolls. The girl at the counter said ""I don't know. Lettuce and and some vegetables? I don't eat that kind of stuff."" Alllrighty then. My husband said he was interested in the Garlic Broccoli but asked if she knows if it is vegan. She looked confused. So, she turned to the girl expediting orders and echoed his question. She said ""I don't even know what you're asking."" The girl expediting asked his question to another girl on the line in the kitchen. She was very exasperated and said ""No. None of our stuff here is vegan."" On that note, we turned around and left. But, I couldn't help but wonder what on earth they put on their edamame that made it NON-vegan. Lol!They clearly did not care and have no idea what goes into the food they are preparing. We went next door to Simply Greek. The staff at Simply Greek were  super friendly and provided a healthy dinner."
1/4/2021,2,"It's not that the food is bad, it's just never correct. My first visit there was no boba in my boba tea, I thought I had ordered wrong so I didnt think much of it. Today they atleast informed me that they were put of boba for the tea. I ordered a bowl that didnt have bell pepper listed on the menu because I cant stand them... my bowl was supposed to have string beans in it. I get home, no string beans and but it did have red bell pepper. Twice a disappointment. After I picked out all the nastiness it dorsnt taste bad... just not what I ordered."
6/13/2020,2,"I have been a fan until the shutdown.  My first visit back to the St. Pete location on June 7th was terrible. The sushi chefs were different, sushi rice was dry, fish was not fresh, the rolls were tiny and overall very old and cheap and dry. .I also ordered the Mongolian beef and the white rice had a burnt flavor. I ended up up making a quick Uncle Ben's at home. The egg roll also was burnt. The fried crust was literally burnt. Dumplings have been okay in the past, but even these didn't taste right.  Very disappointing and I will not eat there again. I live 2 blocks away. This was a bi-weekly treat that I will not waste my paycheck on anymore.Bye Bento"
1/6/2021,2,"I ordered 2 bento boxes for pickup(currently doing only pickup and delivery).  Neither one came with the side sauce and I even paid for an extra sauce. Of course it's pickup and delivery so it's not like you can somehow get your sauce .  I won't be ordering from here again., such a disappointment. Everyone wants you to cut them a break since COVID19. Why? Just do your job."
3/17/2020,4,"Decently priced, but the bowl lacked flavor. Even with sauce, I was missing something. The interior is really nice, service was mediocre."
3/28/2021,2,Loved Bento near UCF in school and recently moved to St. Pete and was so excited since I've missed Bento so much. Tried ordering for pickup on a Sunday night around 7:00 and their online ordering was down. No problem decided to give them a call and order over the phone. Well low and behold I have been on the call for about 15 minutes now and nobody has answered. I've triple checked their hours and confirmed that they are open. Such a shame because I know how good the Orlando Bento is.
12/13/2020,1,Nasty female manager. They're out of noodles for the bento box and would only substitute a lower cost item because it would be too much trouble for them to substitute a different type of noodle. Other locations have decent staff but not here.
10/1/2019,5,I started at the original in Gainesville and the expanded locations keep up the quality. The Spicy Cream Chicken is my go to meal and it hits the spot every time. My wife got sushi on this visit and it was delicious as always. If you want a big step up in quality over your typical Chinese / Japanese take out definitely go to Bento!!
12/8/2020,1,"Awful service, I would not recommend going to this place. After placing my order 30 minutes earlier online, I get there at the scheduled pick up time. I don't like to wait around restaurants during COVID-19. I order ahead, and I am in and out quick. However, when I requested my order is when they started to work on my order. So why did I order ahead? I tipped ahead online, and then after waiting 10-15 minutes for the food to be ready, I requested my tip be refunded as I didn't see the service meet the expectations. They said they couldn't do that now, and I'd have to wait an undetermined amount of time later."
12/7/2019,4,"Sushi Combo Box  with spicy mex,  fried avo, and Cali. Tasty and fresh!  Service just ok. Not a fan of the cali but the rest was good."
8/4/2019,3,"The food was good and the restaura Tnt desing was net, but front staft were not very nice with new customers. They were not friendly suggesting plates or answering questions."
9/19/2020,5,"I was asked by a co-worker to pick a place and meal I wanted for my send off from an 11.5yr work tenure. It was a hard choice but since I'm no longer living and now working in downtown st.pete I had to choose Bento! Since we were all stuck at work they used Uber eats to order for delivery online. I REALLY wanted the fried tofu I first tried in what I believe was teriyaki sauce or something sweet and savory. But the only option for fried was the pokè bowls. I really wanted a Bento box. I chose the Mongolian Box with shrimp and white rice. I read some negative reviews for the ginger salad. I know ginger can be an acquired taste and pickled ginger depends on the way it's pickled. I personally love ginger and have been greatly disappointed with bought pickled jars and restaurants meals with ginger. I would have to disagree with the negative reviews for the salad here. My negative would be, I wish the salad was full sized cause I loved it and it was a basic salad. The ginger made all the difference. The whole meal was delicious. I hate to say I have a small negative but the lo mein wasn't as good as I've had at hole in the walls. Maybe it wasn't drenched in grease or drenched in oil to give that savory flavor. I added teriyaki sauce to it and it was edible. That would be maybe half a star negative from the review since the fried tofu is what originally sold me. Everything else was top notch. I also had the veggie spring rolls which were also very tasty. I was very satisfied with my meal but I hope my next and future experiences are with the fried tofu that I fell in love with and mouth water over."
7/10/2021,2,I went to get some boba & food. No one told me till they handed me my drink with a paper straw & spoon that they ran out of boba straws. I wish someone could've at least told me before. How am I supposed to enjoy my drink with a tiny paper straw & spoon. So unprofessional.
7/17/2019,2,"Not as good as I had hoped. Upon arrival, the first thing that I noticed was a dirty bowl at the counter where they had stacks of ""clean"" bowls. I told the counter person and it was promptly removed. Then when I had my order brought to me, I thought it looked great. Only after the first bite did I realize that they had not removed the tails from the shrimp. Yuck! And I felt that the rice was cold. Overall, not impressed with portion size compared to price."
11/6/2020,1,"We were the only people in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes for us to get our order. They kept putting to go orders on the shelf but had no priority for us, who were sitting there waiting. Mind you, we only ordered two things: 1 bento box and 1 poke bowl. After 30 minutes goes by, I had drank my whole large boba tea and my food finally came out, only for half my toppings on my poke bowl to be missing. They did not offer any compensation for our time or their error besides a half apology. We will not be returning to any Bento Box."
12/20/2020,2,"Poor service all around. I ordered delivery online. My order was assigned to DoorDash. Time was 60 minutes, order to arrive by 7:15 pm. I checked status at 7:25 and it still just said received. I called Bento. He said ""it's here"" so I ask about DoorDash and what's up? His reply was ""I don't know, I've never ordered from us online."" Seriously? So I hang up and call DoorDash. That guy tells me they don't have any active dashers and it could be 45 more minutes. What?!  I call Bento back to inform them we are coming to PICK UP our DELIVERY order that is now 20 minutes late that we've waited over an hour for because they assigned it to a delivery service that has no drivers.  His answer, ""ok, it's here.""  Wow.  Just wow.  Food was average.  And cold."
3/1/2019,2,"I'm struggling about whether to give this two or three stars. I think I will focus on the food and therefore give it 2 stars.   The people were very nice and the place is clean and they cook fast. First time visiting. I got the bento box to go.   The lo mein noodles were covered in oil, I couldn't finish them they were so oily.  They were good noodles though, nice n firm and well cooked.  The green beans were old and cold and were a very tiny portion.  They were also greasy.  I was looking forward to the green beans as the healthy portion of the meal but it was about 1 table spoon of green beans. The salad was wilted and had so much dressing on it that it was like a half a centimeter of liquid at the bottom of that partition. And the dressing tasted terrible, really terrible, it was just SO SALTY and that was the only note.  it didn't have any of the fresh essence of good Thai carrot ginger dressings.  I couldn't eat the salad it was so bad.  It tasted like it's 1/2 soy sauce.  Ok... you get the idea!The little desert wonton with condensed milk was yummy and a super cute idea. Brown Rice was cooked just right.Unfortunately the main dish was absolutely drenched in orange sauce-- I mean like again a pool of it at the bottom that was totally unnecessary and overwhelming.  If I had to estimate I would say they took my one portion of chicken and poured about half a cup of sauce into it.  Thankfully it was a tasty sauce.  I will probably order it again and ask for light sauce.  I ordered it with the no-batter chicken, and that is definitely worth it because it was good white meat chicken.All in all it comes out as a fast food level execution because of the temperature and sauce and oil and dressing issues.  It could be so much better if they just control the cook's heavy hand.Staff was great."
5/26/2021,1,I've been coming to this place since they opened. The menu is less and less interesting. I waited 20 min today for a simple order. By then a disinterested employee told me they had many online orders so maybe another 10-15 minutes. I left and I will not return.
5/22/2021,5,"I enjoyed the Japanese Bagel sushi roll, Korean Rice Bowl, and Orange Noodle Bowl (though I added my own spices to those last two). Certainly worth an UberEats craving order!"
8/16/2020,3,I come to bento occasionally and it's always been consistent food quality! As we know it's typically a walk up service but during COVID things have change. Understandable so. So now walk up orders are taking 28 mins I guess and counting to be fulfilled awhile we stand here. It's just a bowl! For a normally walk up to order restaurant their neighborhood clients that walk up spend more time waiting then they ever did! It's now 35 mins still waiting. Luckily they told just me what the issue was. So I'll continue to wait bc that's all you can do. Total wait time - 37 mins
2/7/2019,1,"So after 1 month since my review, they finally commented here asking me to e-mail so they can "" Fix it"".   I e-mailed them 3 days ago but I have not heard yet.  Though I totally agree if you comment like that, maybe people think this restaurant cares about their customers BUT NOT.  Oh well... if anyone ask me if I know any good Asian restaurants around, this place is on my NO-GO list. As an Asian I get that question often by the way"
4/24/2020,2,Ordered take out via grub hub for shrimp wok fried  rice and sushi. Picked up the order and opened the box to find chicken wok fried rice. Chicken is my least favorite protein hence why I ordered shrimp. Did not take it back due it was raining hard and i was read to eat something even if it was wrong. Not sure if the failure is on grub hub or the restaurant. Still will probably deter me from returning.
7/10/2020,5,"Excellent food, very tasty, reasonably priced... and they're watching out for our health by providing truly sanitary contactless delivery!!"
4/28/2020,5,You can't go wrong. My favorite is the beef with lo mein noodles and veggies and the poke bowls are to die for. Oh and did I mention the sushi! Yum
12/28/2018,4,"A colleague and I tried this place out for lunch the other day.  It is quick serve, order at the counter bowls and sushi.  They had lo mein bowls with lots of Chinese standards for topping; Pao Pao, General Tso's, etc.  Poke bowls with two proteins and lots of topping choices.  Brown rice alternative for all dishes available, didn't notice an upcharge.  Sushi rolls, many with krab.  It was clean and tasted fresh.  A good amount of food for price paid.  I would do lunch again or a bowl for dinner on the run.  Enjoy!"
10/20/2018,5,"Honestly, I went to the CVS across this place and after I was done decided to have a late lunch at Bento. The symbol looked somewhat familiar and after reading the reviews I remember the ones I had been to in Gainesville and Orlando. Nice to see it here in St Pete. The menu is quite extensive. You can choose stir fry, poke bowl, sushi or a Bento box. I wanted to try their poke bowl. It had 3 sizes: mini, regular, large. I chose the regular. You get up to 2 proteins (I chose tuna), up to 2 bases (I chose brown rice and greens), up to 4 toppers (I chose edamame, avocado, wakame and asparagus) and you get to choose 2 sauces (I chose ginger dressing and poke soy which is basic garlic sesame soy). You need to order your dish at the counter and take a number. The food arrived within about 5 minutes. Really nice size with the dressings on the side. It tasted really good. Wasn't too excited about the brown rice but it blended well with the dish. The people that worked there were all nice and worked well together. Glad we have a Bento Cafe now in St Pete."

10/16/2018,5,"I worked at the Gainesville location in college for two years and I still crave it to this day. The amount of excitement I felt when they finally opened the St. Pete location was beyond wordsSome 10/10 favorites would be the red curry katsu rice bowl, the bulgogi noodle bowl (sub udon), and the mt Fuji roll. Do yourself a favor and support this great company!"
1/11/2019,5,I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this place on bitesquad ! I love bento box anything and oh my goodness this place does not disappoint! They give you so much food for what you pay for and that really says a lot about a restaurant. It was so good I ordered 3 days in a row  the only thing I would say is the Thai tea tastes like the powdered Thai tea but the boba pearls were perfect !!
4/6/2020,2,"I just received my order via Uber Eats. I ordered orange chicken and tofu with curry sauce. I received 1) sweet and sour coated chicken and 2) chicken with curry sauce. Dish 1) is so sweet that it's inedible. Dish 2) looks tasty, but it was for a vegetarian, so inedible. I'll try it later. Also, the rice is inseparable, like it had been sitting for a while or steamed after it was prepared. I will not order from this restaurant again. Now, I have to go cook dinner after spending $36.00 on an inedible dinner."
12/8/2018,3,"I live 2 blocks away so it is very convenient for me. The food is good, nothing special but good. I love sushi but my husband likes cooked food. We both enjoy it for a night when we don't want to cook. I too have a problem with the service. They act like they don't want to be there. If you order something wrong they belittle you. The other day the cashier was telling me something but walked away to help someone else. I kept asking her waist she said but never looked at me again."
3/28/2021,5,The food was good and I got a lot of Katsu. Wish there was more rice but it was all very tasty. I got Japanese curry sauce for dipping and that was so good I could've eaten just the sauce and been happy. Also I got a slush with popping pearls which did not disappoint. All in all very tasty and I'll be eating more from here.
12/4/2018,2,"I'd give the food probably 4 stars. I had to subtract two cuz of the poor service I got from the girl who took my order. I first said I wanted the Spicy Donburi. And I asked if she can add extra salmon to my bowl.  Then she said it doesn't come with salmon, only steak. And she directed me to go to the front door and take another look at the menu. So I did. And I did see with my real eyes that the bowl I tried to order comes with either tuna or salmon. And then I held that menu and reordered it with her. And she just pretended nothing had happened. And I asked her again if I could order extra salmon, she said ""im sure there is a way"". I think this is really rude. And it wasted me 15min cuz by the time I came back to reorder, there were a couple ahead of me already. I would urge the management to do something to ensure better customer experience."
6/28/2020,5,"I go to Bento RELIGIOUSLY and I can't thank them enough for their efforts during these trying times to provide OUTSTANDING customer service on a consistent basis while taking every measure to insure safety and cleanliness. Their staff is absolutely amazing, thoughtful and prompt! You won't find better sushi or poke bowls downtown and the personal touch in service provided by the manager Doug shines through. Keep up the stellar work!"
3/15/2021,3,"I paid almost 20$ for my Poke bowl, I barely got any ingredients besides rice, it's like they are making it look big by putting all that rice and then cover it with 3 pieces of mushrooms, 1 piece of cabbage from kimchi, literally, a bite worth of crab salad ( cost me 3$ to add it by the way) and 3 pieces of fish. I understand that you have to make money but it is not acceptable. I love poke and I've tried poke bowls all over Tampa and St. Pete area, they are usually cheaper and you can get a lot more for that price. Not coming back unfortunately."
7/16/2020,1,70$ worth of food-- not good! Definitely think we should have gotten more food for the price. The food was good but pricy for the amount.
8/7/2019,1,"Customer service: poor. The line had about 15 people and it didn't get to me until about 30 minutes. Being a cafe, self serve/ordering, this sure was not fast whatsoever. And I came to realized it's because the staff at the ordering counter could not give a damn. My friend wanted a bento box, and it was sold out. We asked why, and the reason isn't because the food or ingredients were out, but it's because the bento box container were all out and that might be because they were all dirty and not washed yet. So having said that, the counter person said the manager said it's sold out. Then the manager was this young lady standing right behind him, with even worse attitude and even less care about the business, said it is sold out to the counter clerk while we are standing right there and she could have just explained to us. Then we said, we don't care about it being in a bento box. Is your box is out, they can just put all the food comes in the box on a plate or something and the manager rolled her eyes and said I guess. When the food arrived, it was actually in a bento box.... ???Food: it's not bad at all. But they didn't have the Japanese spicy red chili pepper when they have udon on the menu was a little disappointing. Speed: very very slow to order. But the food came out really fast"
12/28/2019,5,"This place was AMAZING! Food quality and flavor was excellent, and the portions were very generous despite reasonable prices. It's an easy walk if wore unfortunate enough to be staying at the very horrible Hilton in south St. Petersburg."
6/12/2019,5,This place is awesome it's clean it's fast and it has a very reasonable price for sushi. If you like sushi go here. Also all the employees are very nice to the customers. I recommend the sushi box and the Rainbow roll.
9/29/2018,5,"The Build-A-Poke bowl is perfection! The regular size is more than ample. Pick two proteins, one base, up to three additions, two toppings and one sauce. Then prepare to be in a food coma! The best part is it is right next door to our apartment complex!!!"
2/7/2021,4,"I'm a regular at Bento and have not had anything from the menu that I haven't liked. Just like everywhere else, they are human and make mistakes. My orders are very often incorrect, occasionally i receive wrong items or they will forget to include something altogether. They are also very often out of menu items such as crab rangoon or boba. Wait times are also very inconsistent, sometimes the wait is less than 10 minutes, other times it's at least 30. I still come back frequently because the food is so good. I recommend ordering online and checking your order before leaving the store."
3/25/2020,5,Very good sushi. I got the chicken tempura roll and the special mex roll and they were both so good. I called in to order and picked it up. Very convenient and delicious.
12/1/2018,5,"This is probably the only place I would go to for Asian food in St. Pete, my boyfriend and I would typically go to vegan Asian places but we have decided to check this place out because of how much recommendation we heard from our friends. The first time here I ordered their large poke bowl but was disappointed in proportion of the toppings for the price. 2nd time we ordered the food here, I was so mind blown how good it is. I ordered the Pao pao tofu, I'm not even a big fan of tofu but the way they cook it is so addicting (keep in mind their pao pao recipe is different from the original, it's a spicy cream and not a teriyaki base). My boyfriend ordered the red curry chicken katsu which was also amazing. I did ordered sushi the 3rd visit and was disappointed so we will stick with the Asian food."
5/4/2020,1,Stay away from their sushi.  It's priced like it's good sushi but tastes like something you would get at a buffet.  Just awful.  The tuna was starting to turn dark from sitting too long.  I threw away $30 of sushi last night and spent $15 at grumpy gringo and got a great dinner.  This was my second time ordering here as they are always discounted on Uber eats.  I will never go back and I caution anyone to be careful.  Sushi is one thing that can get you very sick and this place is like fast food.
1/26/2021,2,Keep the rice crispy treats off of the sushi please..chicken pretty rubbery- very disappointed
1/24/2021,1,"Every time I call ahead once I get there I still have to wait 20+ minutes, I always call before work and I end up never having time to eat...6 people waked in after me and they all got their food before mine was even ready and I had called ahead of time..I ended up waiting 40 minutes and had to go straight to work I'm not one to complain but this is the 5th time now"
7/19/2019,5,"SO YUM ask for the spicy cream chicken you will not be disappointed!  Also all the sushi is great, and if you have to park in the garage let them know and they will give you a voucher."
6/14/2019,5,Bento has become a weekly visit for me... I absolutely love this place. There are so many options on the menu that I could easily eat here seven days a week and not repeat the same meal twice! Everything is cooked to order. It's outstanding!
10/15/2019,5,"In downtown St Pete, with an explosion of options, this is a core go-to place for me.  Food quality is great.  Portions are generous for the price.  Can customize my bowl to my mood. Service is reasonably quick.  A pleasant setting that isnt too noisy (which is exceedingly rare).  Centrally located.I always walk away delighted!"
12/17/2019,5,Fast quick and efficient service Amethyst remembered me and my order  I'm so glad Bentos has a remembering employee thank you Amethyst for your service I recommend every customer to Ask for Amethyst if yo want quick and efficient service
10/6/2019,1,Canceled our Uber eats order twenty five minutes after we placed it. Won't say why.i called up they say it's because they're out of gen Taos shrimp. I say can you make it with chicken they say yes but we have to reorder through Uber. Go to reorder and it's unavailable. You get one chance to make a first impression and this was a terrible first impression. Highly doubt we'll ever eat here.
10/5/2019,4,"Great for lunch. I would compare to an Asian-style chipotle because one had the option of creating their own bowls. I got a chicken- brown rice poke bowl (not a tuna fan) with shredded carrot, cucumber, avocado, snap peas and Siracha for 7 bucks, not bad for lunch."
6/1/2019,1,"My coworker and I were in st Pete visiting on a work trip. We both got two completely different things and returned to our hotel to get some sleep for the event the following day. We both woke up in the middle of the night throwing up.  Work event didn't go so well. Not sure why but, both of got really sick and the only thing we ate all day was from bento"
12/2/2020,1,Place is awful. Have been to several bentos but this location messes the order up every time. When I addresses it with the cashier they didn't say sorry or do an
1/24/2019,4,"This is a nice addition to the area. I recommend bento for the bento boxes. I've been there twice and both times had the bento box with chicken. It's a ton of food and you get to choose one sauce to accompany your meal.. don't know about you but I'm a fan of sauces. My husband who said he wanted a dinner with ""a lot of food"" was pleased with the amount of food in the bento. We also tried the tuna sushi roll. There is an option to do a half roll, which is what did as an appetizer. The food quality also is good, service is good, wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tea, though. Overall, a satisfying lunch or dinner spot that I'll definitely visit again."
10/4/2019,5,Great atmosphere! Great food! Great drinks! You need to try the dragon drink. The food was delicious.
7/11/2020,5,"We got them thru uber eats and everything was great! I got the sushi combo box and it had the sushi I wanted and noodle and salad side dishes. We also ordered the chicken pad Thai and that was tasty as well. A lot of uber eats orders aren't that great, especially sushi, but this place was really good!!"
9/7/2020,1,"We are regulars at Bento, unfortunately  the St Pete location continues to disappoint. We ordered online and PAID for extra spicy mayo, yet it never came, along with requested silverware, chopsticks, AND soy sauce. I have never ordered sushi and it had NOT come with chopsticks and soy sauce at the least. A COMPLETE disappointment. BEWARE"
11/6/2018,5,"YAY!! A Bento in St. Pete!! I'm so excited! Bento is one of my Gainesville favorites. I insisted my dad (who lives in St. Pete) meet me for lunch the exact moment I found out it existed. I parked right out front and paid the meter because I didn't know any better but for all of you reading this, Bento has an agreement with the apartment complex building where you can park there for free to visit Bento and you basically receive validated parking. I always appreciate a restaurant doing their best to create parking for their customers. We ordered and received our food promptly. I always order the spicy cream chicken (Pao Pao) with mini udon noodles and my dad ordered the sweet and sour pineapple chicken with brown rice. They always give you huge portions and my dad ate all of it so I'm pretty sure he was pleased. I ate 2/3s and took the remainder home for the hubby. It was just as delicious as the food at their flagship location so I will be making the hike to St. Pete regularly for my Bento fix. For a new restaurant, there were no issues to report and that is saying something."
6/9/2020,1,"Love the food however the guy bagging the food was using the same gloves running the register , touching and finger combing his hair and packing and boxing the food. Talk about NASTY! Even mentioned to a manager and he didn't say anything to him. Just Bagged our food for us instead. And he would wipe his face and finger comb again touch the food stuff and repeat. Not sanitary at all. But the food is good I must say."
1/8/2019,5,"Interesting sushi concept. I loved the fact that you can make a meal with your roll that includes soft drink, edamame, miso soup or salad. Pretty reasonably priced, quick lunch service. Would return for lunch again!"
10/5/2018,1,"I went into this restaurant for lunch today, thinking I'd be in and out in 2 seconds, and the entire time I was in there my photograph was being taken without my consent - only after I was already sitting down and multiple pictures of me (looking terrible) had already been taken, was a sign placed on the door that said ""Shoot in progress... If you do not feel comfortable with this, please attend a different location."" Well, I wouldn't have gone in the restaurant had I known I was going to be immortalized forever in sweatpants w/ no bra. Thanks a lot for violating my privacy."
1/1/2019,5,Ordered last minute for New Years Eve. Loved everything we got. Will definitely be back
4/16/2019,5,This place is being added to my list of great places to eat in Downtown St. Pete. I ordered take out and was very back and forth about trying a new place but the quality of the food was amazing! I put special instructions to prepare the chicken extra crispy because sometimes orange chicken can get too breaded and they nailed it. I will definitely be ordering again in the future.
10/27/2018,5,"Their sushi bowls are delicious! Great options, very fast, and super fresh. Been back a few times!"
11/14/2019,5,"Another favorite eatery from our Gainesville days, now with a location near us (over the bridge in St. Pete)!  Spicy creamy chicken (now called Pao Pao chicken) is such a creamy and crunchy delight!  The sushi bowls are fresh and well portioned!  The sushi is outstanding and nothing here will break the bank.  Great flavors and selection.  Great casual date location or family dinner.   Katsu chicken with ramen noodles is also great to share!  Boba tea is available for those who are into it.    For families with children, I'd recommend you start with the chicken katsu and pao pao chicken.  Crunch roll on the side.  This is our children's favorite restaurant. Very excited to see a new location coming to the Tampa USF area but still holding out hope they will open a location in South Tampa!   How else will able be able to cater my group's and family events without a closer location?  I'm getting hungry writing this review...gotta go back."
1/4/2019,5,"I love Bento.  Used to stop by everytime I was in Orlando, so happy they opened a St. Pete location.  Everything I've ordered is great.  Good service / friendly staff as well."
3/9/2019,5,Had a great first visit to the St Pete location. Ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken and some krab wontons which are like crab Rangoon. Also ordered some small sushi rolls. The food was excellent and the fried rice bowl was large enough for 3 people.  Clean restaurant and the staff was very friendly. Will be back.
2/25/2020,2,"I have been here several times and the food is usually pretty good, however this time I got the poke bowl with tuna and chicken. The tuna and the bowl was fairly good, but the chicken was a little suspect. I ordered grilled teriyaki chicken and expected to find white meat chicken but what I received was grizzly dark meat chicken which was horrible. I will return but will steer clear of the chicken unless it's changed."
2/11/2020,5,"Highly recommended. Chipotle style Asian food. Nicely designed, clean, good food, friendly staff, affordable, healthy, large portions."
2/4/2020,5,"I typically bring my lunch to work but recently, have had to order take out using various delivery services (ie: uber eats).  In my experience using these delivery services, I mentally prepare for the food to not be as up to par as if you were to physically eat in the establishment.  I chop that up to the price we pay for the convenience of ordering food through a third party vendor for pick up/delivery.  This has not been an issue when ordering from Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi.  The food has always been made with love and packaged carefully.  I've ordered everything from sushi bento boxes to lo mein dishes and Bento Asian Kitchen has not sacrificed their food preparation when preparing take out orders.  Veggies are always cooked perfectly, different flavors stand out on their own and dishes have not been overcooked.  The sushi shows up just as expected.  Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi will continue to be my go to on those days when I'm forced to order delivery."
7/20/2019,1,so I   just ordered sushi from here on uber eats I   honestly couldn't even eat it! it tasted so flipping fishy and the fish was so rubbery!! CLEARLY the fish they use isn't good and they arent properly rotating it!
10/15/2018,4,Thought it was pretty good and really liked the Bento Box concept. As someone who tends to over eat it provides just the right portions. Felt full but not over stuffed. Will definitely go back for more.
10/13/2018,4,"Though the prices had us a little wary, fixed incomers that we are, Bento Cafe's ample portions, great flavors, vibrant decore and hospitable staff won our wallets! Seldom does my husband carry home left-overs, but some of his katsu pork cutlet came home with us. Just a block from our apartment, we'll be thinking inside the box often."
10/6/2018,5,"Great food, clean environment, friendly staff. Sushi rolls and poke bowl were delicious. Loved the different size options for poke bowls. Will frequent this location way too often."
11/7/2019,1,"Came here for lunch and it took over 30 minutes for them to prepare our to go order and when we got it, it was only half of the order. Luckily my friend was able to get a refund for her part but no one apologized or tried to help in anyway. The crowd of people waiting for pick up and to go orders completely clogged the entrance. The food I got was good but didn't make up for the wait."
7/26/2019,3,"First time here and ordered the Szechuan chicken over brown rice. The portion size is rather small for the price and there was way too much sauce that totally drenched everything. The sauce also had way too much salt in it and I felt like I was going to have a hypernatremic episode. All in all, this place was just okay. Nothing special whatsoever and I could get better quality and taste elsewhere."
11/11/2018,5,"I had the best Bento box ever! They serve fresh amazing sushi, bento boxes, boba teas, and the best udon noodles! Highly recommend! The staff was super friendly and gave great suggestions!"
6/29/2019,3,"Was just alright, first time in a poke bowl the krab was strips and not krab salad, didn't really taste fresh."
1/16/2019,4,"I was super excited to finally have a Bento in the St.Pete area because of all the hype I had gotten from all my friends in the Gainesville area. My sister and I stopped in for dinner with the my nieces and nephew the first week the opened, and to our surprise it was not super crazy busy. Totally not complaining because we did not wait long at all to order or for our meals to be brought out. So if you have never been here before, you will view a menu and order at the register. Once your order is placed, you will receive a number and you can have a seat at any open table. A Bento team member will deliver your order to you at your table. There were 3 adults, 3 kids, and we spent a pretty good amount on our dinner for ""Chinese"" food. My sister felt it was a little pricey for the amount of meals we ordered, but I felt the portions were a good size, the ambience was nice, and the quality of food was worth it. The kids even ate all of their food which was pretty shocking especially my nephew who is the pickiest eater I know! I actually think it's an added bonus for kids because their meals came in cute little bento boxes that they all wanted to take home (but of course didn't). We ordered a mix of bento box meals, sushi, and tuna bowl. I enjoyed everything, but I did not really care for the tuna bowl. It was just lacking flavor in the tuna since it was not marinated and was just topped with different sauces that we requested. My favorite had to be the katsu and the pao pao spicy shrimp (which is not at all spicy just super delicious)!"
6/26/2019,1,"So their statement on the menu 'substitute brown rice upon request' isn't actually true.  I attempted to order the Combo Box and was told no I couldn't have the brown rice.  I then asked if I ordered the items separately could I have the brown rice, she said yes.  I told her that made no sense.  She never even offered an upcharge as an option.  Won't be going there again which is a shame since I live next door.  Too many great options in downtown St Pete to deal with this lunacy."
5/31/2019,5,So glad we stopped by this place before our concert just blocks away. Fresh taste and perfect temperature when served. We both loved our entrees so much that we decided to eat half and take the other half home.
6/12/2019,5,"I visited Bento yesterday evening, it was honestly an amazing experience. The environment was so clean and inviting and the workers were so friendly and looked happy to be there. The food was absolutely to die for, I'm a sucker for Asian cuisine. I  had the Sriracha Garlic Chicken and their Wontons (it's definitely a must try)! The employees made sure I had everything I needed and didn't make me feel uncomfortable or stupid when I asked for something. The one employee with the braids was super sweet to me and made me feel super welcome. I 100% recommend visiting Bento, whether it is to try the food or not. I have been to many restaurant chains, none that have made me feel so welcome all while having good food and quick service. I will be coming back eventually and I look forward to it!"
6/2/2019,4,"1st time - took the dogs, seating outside, water bowls.  2 orders - took about 10 mins.  Rice bowl with veg stir fry, noodle bowl with tofu, spring rolls. Very tasty,  rice was clumpy though!  We parked in Publix, were in and out in 15 mins.  7 PM on Saturday night,  not busy, walked right up to the counter."
11/27/2018,5,Tried it for the first time yesterday. It was busy at dinner time. The restaurant smelled amazing.  We ordered a somewhat mainstream Signature bowl and an 8-piece sushi roll to-go and both were fresh and really good. The go packaging included all the condiments you would expect. Will definitely go back and try some of the more inventive menu items. Great new concept for DTSP.
2/2/2019,3,The food is always tasty. But I have yet to get a fully correct order from them. There's always something missing. Or the cooks just completely ignored a simple modification of an item or subtraction. Laziness or ticket error? The food is good enough to give it one more ( of many) attempts. But it's things like these that just turn me off of ordering out from anywhere and keep me cooking at home. And I am not picky.
1/30/2019,5,This place is really good! I went around peak lunch time and the line moved easily - didn't take long to get food either. I got a sesame chicken bowl with rice; it had really good flavor and wasn't too salty (as some foods in Asian cuisine can be). Big portions for the price! Very clean and overall a great atmosphere. This is a great addition to downtown St. Pete's lunch spots. I'll definitely be back
7/6/2022,4,"What a great surprise deciding to eat lunch here!  It was not busy at all and the service and ticket times were excellent.  Service is a tricky aspect of dining out for the past few years and the ""Covid"" excuse is overused as an excuse for poor service and attitudes.We ordered:-cup of soup of the day ""Shrimp Tom Yum""-Shrimp Tempura Udon Soup-Pao Pao Noodle Bowl with Chicken -Gochujang Garlic Noodle w/chicken EVERYTHING was fresh, hot and delicious!  I tried for a picture but didn't make it!!...sorry!!!I will definitely go back as soon as I can and HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone!!"
12/23/2022,1,"I wish 0 stars was an option that's HOW BAD it was. Service, horrible, food, not worth $16 for those cheap sushi roles and hard gross app. To make it even worst i paid almost $100 and they gave me my food in Togo boxes not even in regular plates because i arrived 50 minutes before closing. My 2 sons and I went out to have a nice family night and instead we ended up grumpy because we waited almost 45 minutes for our food!!!!!!!!! Then when the 35 minute mark hit i went up to the kitchen to ask how much longer and the kitchen staff said ""oh it's sushi it's not ready."" I said how much longer it's been almost 40 minutes? He quickly snapped loudly and said "" we will get to it when it's ready!!!!"" And i told him he should not speak to a customer that's been waiting 40 minutes that way. The cashier was super rude which was a sign i should have left from the beginning. The reason why we talked in was because of the boba sign outside and when we got there at 8:10pm they said they closed the boba machine.Other customers that were also waiting 30-40 min heard the kitchen staff snap at me and told me that he too snapped at them. One guy said he asked for a Togo box and he gave him attitude saying you know they're over there and just pointed. All around the staff is a bunch of young kids that are RUDE.We ended up having our family dinner outside in our Togo boxes because i was so turned off by how rude the staff was being and being around other unhappy customers that were also starving. The floors were disgustingly wet and sticky one staff member even slipped and fell in front of the customers. I feel like i wasted my money. So sad. Don't go there trust me the food is not worth it and the experience is horrible."
10/31/2022,3,"On my first visit, the fried rice was much better than I expected. My first visit I ordered red curry and it was delicious. I couldn't wait to go back.The 2nd visit, I ordered the green curry. It was bland and some of the rice seemed bland and crunchy (undercooked). It left much to be desired. I haven't made any plans to return, but I'll chalk it up to the chef having a bad night. I would give them one more chance - but that's it."
1/10/2022,2,"... it's hard to give this place even 3 stars. I'll tell you why. The interior of this place is fantastic, and the design of website makes it look so visually appealing... BUT here's the kicker. The foooood.... Is okay... at best. The entrées and menu are promising (photos, etc) but not the taste. I got a bento box, miso soup, and kimchi. My favorite thing out of it all was probably the kimchi. Spicy, earthy, and tasty. Everything else, makes me question the freshness and sourcing of the ingredients. The Sichuan bento box has white rice, which sits in the container soaking up a overly sweet... soy sauce? I didn't think it was super great because white rice helps cleanse your palette and make you feel less saturated with all of the strong flavors. The soup tasted okay, seemed a bit like the base came from a package though. The salad was plain, covered in something similar to a ginger sauce, it was fine. The noodles were a liiittle weird though... haha strange tasting and had a pungent stinky, stale smell (like cat pee... YIKES LOL so I didn't finish those). Green beans were also a bit odd tasting, and had a layer of oldness to it. The chicken and steak were just very underwhelming and also heavily carried  by the sweet sauce. Which was fine, and no fault of the chefs/employees. But the company should try to buy fresh meat and nice quality produce, this tastes like it came out of a box too.Something funny was the Wonton strips they add, they taste exactly like the cinnamon twists from Taco Bell... LOL And for 18.00 (added steak to the box; 15-16$ usually) you sort of expect better. I could have went to an actual Asian restaurant and got a whole meal... expected this place to be somewhat nicer, or authentic because of its presentation, but it is not haha... Panda Express is similar in concept, but better because their ingredients taste real/fresh without funky flavors. And don't even try the boba, if you're a big boba fan LOL it's quite disappointing, but again it's not a Boba place. Anyways, I'm not sure if it was just a bad day, but I'm sure it's more of a corporate supply choice for the food/ingredients for the boba and entrees. Maybe someone who works in the offices can look into making the food better. Because it looks great and is nice/calming to sit in, alongside a nice staff and a very appealing menu. But it really does miss the mark unfortunately. Would love to try it again if they redid their food/boba.TLDR: looks upscale, charges upscale, but doesn't taste upscale. The food value does not match the cost. Interior is sleek, fresh, fun and cool. This place has no problem attracting people, the food just needs a bit of improvement"
6/16/2022,5,What can I say? Ever since I tried the Pao Pao chicken rice bowl I have been addicted to this place. I go at least once a week. Yea I know that's pretty unhealthy but man this bowl has my number. I love it so much. You have to try it!! It never misses-- and the veggies are great too. The peppers are delicious. Try this bowl and then you can thank me later.
12/19/2022,3,"Service great, food not so much. Staff were very nice and helpful but food very plain not much flavor we were actually surprised."
12/19/2021,4,"This is located in the University Town Center, just off I-75 and University.  The food is good for a semi-fast food concept.  You order at the counter and are provided a number.  You take your choice of seats either inside or outside (which is primarily a view of the next door California Kitchen, which typically has a TV with sports on).  They bring the food to your table when readyFood options are both sushi and bowls.  I tried a Bento box for $15 with chicken. You could then select the style of the box, where I chose Mongolian.  There is a lot of good food in the box (4 stars).Others in my party tried the Florida roll sushi (4 stars) and the chicken fried rice (3.5 stars).  The sushi was pretty standard and gluten free.  You are also given the option for one sauce on the side, which everyone choose Spicy Mayo (5 stars).Service: 2 stars. The lone person taking orders at the register had the personality of a newt.  Absolutely no desire to be there.  The person who brought the food out was nice and made sure the orders were right.  Beyond that you are on your own, including taking all your trash to a return window that reminded me of a cafeteria diner. Parking can be tight when it it busy, but there is usually plenty of additional parking across the street towards the main mall."
3/30/2022,5,"A great place for a quick lunch or dinner.   Serving asian fusion ""fast food"", so you can satisfy several cravings here whether it be a Mongolian beef bento box or some sushi.  Options for everyone here."
11/9/2022,3,Had a teriyaki chicken bowl with fried rice and a sushi roll. The bowl was good but the sushi was not. The roll was bland with no sauce topping. Put a little soy sauce on it and that's all you taste. Stick with the bowls and save your sushi appetite for a real sushi restaurant.
6/16/2022,4,"Some really good options! Tried the sushi and it did not disappoint, can't wait to try the boba and other offerings! A lot of room sit, takes a while to get your food but worth it."
11/3/2021,4,"Nice to dine at a clean and upscale fast Asian restaurant. They served sushi, bento boxes, and even have boba. The kid size was just enough for me and had great flavor."
7/13/2022,5,Staff was super friendly and ready to help with your order. They answered all my questions and I didnt feel bad asking. Food was fast and fresh. Bobba tea is always a classic and they know how to make it right!
7/1/2022,5,"Bento is by far one of the best Sushi places around. Also, if you like COCONUT YELLOW CURRY chicken dishes they got you covered. The service is super nice and the atmosphere is chill. I like ordering from the app and come in to pick up counter. Super friendly staff. Enjoy."
4/27/2022,1,Bring your own spoon!I ordered the tofu udon soup. Luckily I was watching the server put in the order because he put in chicken udon and I do not eat meat. I asked if the udon soup came with vegetables in it. When a different server brought my udon the tofu was on the side and the vegetables were in a bowl on the side. I asked the server for a spoon and she pointed me to the plastic utensils. The only option to eat soup was a very shallow small plastic teaspoon. What?  The broth had no flavor. The vegetables looked like they came out of a bag. I got the bill and saw that they had charged me $4.50 for the vegetables. If you are going to charge someone $4.50 for a tiny bowl of vegetables that you inferred came with the soup. PLEASE let them know. If you are going to sell someone a bowl of soup PLEASE ask them if they brought their own spoon because you will not be providing one for them.
1/3/2022,2,"This place is awful, it is clearly not ran by someone who understands food and customer service/experience. Microwave quality at best, ordered stir fry bowls, both were swimming in sauce and extremely salty (I guess like this review ). Same for miso soup, way too salty, also, keep miso soup simple, leave out the cheap mushrooms, no one asked for them.We initially came in for sushi, as named and advertised, only to be told by the cashier that they are currently not doing sushi... what kind of restaurant has sushi in their name and doesn't do sushi. The poor guy taking our order didn't even have a solid answer as to why they don't have sushi.Menu: the menu is vast and is best suited for waiter service type of a restaurant, there are far too many choices to decide upon in a matter of a couple of minutes. Tip: either simplify the menu if you're trying to be like chipotle or blaze pizza, or consider having waiter service.Price: too much for what we received, and I actually don't care how much I pay as long as I'm wowed, I wasn't even a little bit.It is sad that the best item were the dumplings, I guess it's pretty hard to mess them up, especially if they came out of a bag and into the deep fryer.This place has potential, but won't be here much longer if changes aren't made.Also, I despise being offered to leave a tip at the register, not knowing what my service will be like or what my food will taste like, both were very disappointing.Good luck, you'll need it."
6/19/2022,1,Ordered on ubereats while staying in sarasota. The food was terrible. The chicken smelled strange and tasted horrible. The best part of the bento box was the white rice. Overpriced and inedible. Save your money.
1/8/2021,3,We tried the Pad Thai and the Korean bowls. We were just ok with the flavors and the value. This had just opened at the UTC. I just think the local operated restaurants beat the pants off the chain restaurants.The restaurant was clean and service was good.
7/30/2022,2,It's a beautiful building but the food didn't live up to expectations . Wanted to love it ! Source better quality steak please .. haven't tasted meat like that since frozen dinners as a kid .
12/24/2021,1,Very bad food. Don't waste your money. I just wasted $65 for 3 very bad tasting dishes.
1/16/2022,1,"What a terrible disappointment.  Our Mongolian steak bento box was utterly tasteless. The sauce on the Mongolian steak was bland and watery.  Everything else in the box was equally without any flavorand just didn't look or taste fresh.They charge as if they are an upscale restaurant, but serve food of less than fast food quality.  Shame on them.  Is the publicthat gullible to accept this as an acceptable Asian restaurant?Don't bother with this one.  A waste of money."
4/3/2021,5,The service is excellent. You order then they give you a table number and you place it on the table and they will bring it to you. You will have to pick up your extra spice but you won't need it. Also get the chopsticks before you sit. The food is really top quality. Better than other restaurants with full services. Really good and fresh food.
9/5/2021,2,Overpriced supermarket sushi and frozen reheated Orange chicken.  The Garlic Endamne was good.  My daughters meal came before the Endamne and then the it  came 5 minutes later.  My meal came a good 15 minutes after my daughters meal.  Everything was just okay.   The girl working the counter didn't know what came with my meal. I asked what  came with the sushi box I was ordering and she said nothing just the rolls you order.  When the meal came it had two different types of salad.  They refuse to except cash and are rude about it. I won't be back.
3/28/2021,4,I'm all about second chances and I decided to give bento one. I'm so glad I did. I definitely think there was improvement. With that being said I definitely think this place is hot or miss. Sometimes it's great other times not so much. I don't know if I just went at a better time and things where fresher. I went around 6:00 this time and 5:30 last time. I got a orange chicken bento box and a poke bowl and both where delicious. Each item in the bento box where hot and just better this time. The poke bowl had good flavor and overall things where better this time.
1/31/2021,4,Great boba tea and great food.  I'm excited Bentos finally opened up in Sarasota.  It was my go to place in college back in the day.  I usually go for the Mongolian rice bowl and never disappoints
1/29/2021,3,"Yes I know places are doing their best during COVID however it should not take 30 mins for a rice bowl. The food was OK but not $15 for a bowl. They add $5 if you want fried rice. Also, when asked about how much longer the lady had the nerve to tell me "" you know it's not easy work"". Good luck hope you figure things out. I will stick with the Yummy house for authentic Asian food"
1/19/2022,4,"I was a little concerned after reading the reviews of this place, but we decided to try it anyways and I was glad we did. They do not have sushi right now, just as a warning to those that are going there for that. It is a little pricey for a fast casual place. The food, however, was good. My sons both loved their food (Korean rice bowl with steak and fried rice, Garlic Broccoli rice bowl with steak) and my youngest son is pretty picky when it comes to Asian restaurants. I had the Sichuan bento box with chicken, I wasn't crazy about the sauce but the chicken and vegetables in it were fresh, not frozen like some reviewers mentioned. The green beans on the side were delicious, the noodles were plain on their own but a good complement to the chicken. My husband had the Gochujang bento box with chicken, his chicken was fried which I don't think he expected and was pretty spicy but good. We also had no issues with service except that my youngest son's meal came out a few minutes later than the rest of our food. Overall we will definitely be back! Oh and they do have outdoor seating which was great and unexpected."
8/19/2021,3,"The food here is really good, but they have a limited menu and it is not clear what they do and do not have. I went in twice and ended up leaving without food due to them being out of what I wanted. I hope they can recover from the pandemic and get their full menu back so I can update my review."
6/1/2021,1,"Usually, an establishment works out their kinks after being open for a while. Not in this case. We visited them in their first few days and were not impressed, so we wanted to give them another chance. It seems as if the staff doesn't care and is completely satisfied with a less than mediocre restaurant. We ordered two things for lunch; a noodle bowl and a poke bowl. The noodle bowl came out in less than 10 minutes. The poke bowl, with all cold ingredients, took more than 30 minutes. It may have taken longer but we had to go to the cashier to find out when the other half of our order would arrive. This would be fine if the food had some flavor, but it truly is nothing to write home about. If they would just add some positive energy to their atmosphere it might make a difference. Instead, this restaurant makes you feel as if you are dining with a group of depressed sloths unable to prepare the menu or clean the dining room (it was filthy). Unfortunately, we will not return."
12/3/2021,5,Always a winner! The rolls are decent sized and the poke bowls are generous. Must tries: sushi combo box and surf n' turf poke bowl
6/10/2021,1,Pissed!  All I wanted after a 2 hour drive was dinner.  I walked in and stood in line to get to the counter to be turned away and told that the kitchen was closed.  They did take the order from the group in front of me.  I wish I could give no stars.  Sucky service!
7/9/2021,3,"Too much rice, too little vegetables. Teriyaki steak didn't come with teriyaki on the steak. Came in a plastic container on the side. You want to do something awesome for your bowls? Go take a look at Fresh Kitchen and make an Asian version of that. Over there I pick my rice, protein, two vegetables all for $11 and the portions are perfect."
10/19/2021,5,Love coming here once a week with my kids. They enjoy the boba teas. Staff is always friendly and the quality of food it's amazing for the price point. My favorite are the orange chicken and Mongolian steak.
1/10/2021,1,"We waiting 30 minutes for our to-go food with the restaurant not busy. We live maybe 5 minutes away and after we got our food, both meals were cold, had incorrect items and had no flavor. I would advise skipping this place and going to Shake Shake next door."
2/27/2021,3,I like bento Asian a lot but this specific one I've had issues with recently. Just this week I've ordered 3 times with Uber eats. The first time I ordered a poke bowl with salmon and they gave me tuna instead. And I just ordered one today with salmon and they gave me spicy salmon which I can't eat. They don't look at the tickets and read them they just throw whatever in your bowl. I will likely not be ordering from here as often if I'm going to continue paying $17 to get it delivered and then get the wrong food.
1/10/2021,5,"The food was excellent! I had the pineapple fried rice, while my fiancé had General Tso Rice bowl. They are definitely in a soft opening and working out kinks with the inside seating, but the food quality and taste more than made up for it."
7/16/2021,1,Employees were nice BUT the food is not authentic. I was very disappointed because I was craving Asian food and was very excited to eat here. There are better places to eat than here.
6/28/2021,5,Food was great! I ordered during a busy time and it was clear they were understaffed - the staff was friendly and even thought it took a while for me food to come out (poke bowl) it was great (:
6/4/2021,2,"I really wanted to support  a local business but after several times the service is really bad , food is cold but somehow takes forever to be ready, and it's pricey. I tried going again because their popping boba is really good! I give a star for that but there's no large size for 2  small /regular cup it's 10$ (including popping boba add on) . I don't mind that but when I wanted to order all the staff ignored me and what seemed to be the manager told me to wait while she was on the tablet.  And then I had to wait AGAIN to order some staff weren't even doing anything they were just wiping stuff down . The atmosphere in that place is bunch of kids who don't want to work. And the food is pretty bland unless your getting sushi. Plus paper straws get soggy but it's good to be sustainable. I hope the best for the future of this business. On top of of me waiting to order I had to wait 10 minutes for 2 slushies."
1/21/2021,3,"I will say that the sushi was good, but our vegetable stir fry was very bland. The mex and special mex roll had good flavor, but the chicken tempura had barely any taste. My boyfriend likes the caliente sushi, but all I could taste was the jalepenos and nothing else. Our friend said the Szechuan sauce was not very good. I would order the mex roll again but probably not anything else."
2/26/2021,2,"well, i'll start out with the good.  the mt fuji sushi was very tasty. but the ""manager"" putting her finger less than an inch away from my food!...  absolutely left it waaay less enjoyable!  i had 2 sushi orders for 2 separate people,  and for some reason they thought they should put both orders in the same container! where do they do that at???!  that was about 3 weeks ago.  thought i'd give it another shot today and boy, i really should have went somewhere else.  i had to ask if they had a problem serving black people here when i watched the person before me and ""4""... four customers ""after me"" get their take out food ahead of me!   i was the only black person in the restaurant waiting & watching other non black people  ordered their food, wait a few reasonable minutes for their food, get their food, eat their food and then leave . all the while im still sitting their waiting until i finally ask the server ( turned out to be ""the manager"") "" is there a problem with my food?""... it took another 5 minutes to get my food! she didnt even offer any sort of compensation, just an ""im sorry & ill get your order out in just axfew more minutes""  took 5 more minutes!  im just asking... does this establishment have a problem serving black people???"
