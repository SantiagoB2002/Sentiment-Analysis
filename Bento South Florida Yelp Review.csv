9/27/2022,5,SOOOOO GOOOODDD!!! Super cute location & great staff! Food came quick and tasted great
7/26/2022,2,"Friendly staff and clean restaurant, but the food was unremarkable. My wife got a bento box with sautéed vegetables and I got a salmon roll and miso soup. My sushi was a bit subpar. The rice was too vinegary and the salmon, which seemed OK, had a very pale orange color to it which made me question the quality. My wife hated her bento box. The vegetables were freshly cooked but the sauce was gloppy and one dimensional. The rest of the box was unremarkable; lukewarm noodles and rice, a basic salad and some green beans. It was certainly a big portion, but it wasn't very good. We both commented how much of a shame it was that the food wasn't better. We love Park Place and eat Asian food quite often. I would come here all the time if it was good. Unfortunately, it wasn't."
12/2/2022,5,I'm originally from New York and consider myself a foodie and a tough critic. Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi in Boca Raton exceeded my expectations. My food arrived much sooner than expected and warm.  My fried dumplings were crispy and the size of the bento box surprised me. Everything was delicious and amazing. The cherry on top had to be the little crunchy wonton crisps in their own little compartment. They were dusted w/ cinnamon and sugar and served as a great little dessert. I will definitely be ordering from them again very soon.
11/28/2022,2,"Food is decent but prices and portions do NOT correlate. I've been eating here for years and it used to be so much cheaper and you would get a decent sized portion. Went today after not going for awhile, paid 18 dollars for a poke bowl just for it be half the size of the actual bowl itself.  If I am paying almost 20 dollars for a bowl I at least expect to get a substantial amount of rice. Very disappointing, the tofu tasted pretty bad and like it's been sitting out all day and dry. Can definitely say I'm not returning here. Very sad as I used to love this place and always ate here."
8/12/2021,4,"In the mood for Asian food, I remembered my friend's suggestion to try Bento. The day came to give it a try! I walked in and place a to go order since I had limited time for lunch. The service was great, I was helped almost immediately and it didn't take too long to get my food to go. I ordered a ""spicy"" fried rice with tofu. I said ""spicy"" in quotation marks because it wasn't spicy at all. Either way it tasted delicious! It had a very pad Thai type of taste, I suspect they cook with peanut oil. It was more in the sweet side. I liked a lot even though it wasn't spicy. I also ordered boba tea. I chose a passion fruit flavor which had a green tea based with lychee pearls. It was way too sweet to my taste, but after adding a little bit of water it became perfect. I'm giving this place 4 stars because of those little details that could make it more authentic perhaps or improve. I still recommend it as a good lunch spot. The food was very tasty even if they don't hit the spicy note!"
7/19/2022,4,If your looking for affordable extra filling lunch this is it. Don't let the size mislead you. It's very yummy
10/24/2021,4,"To-go sushi, poke, and hot Asian food style restaurant. I ordered the taro milk tea with honey boba. The boba was perfectly cooked but I found the milk tea itself to be overly sweet and taste more like a milkshake. My boyfriend and I both ordered regular build your own poke bowls and honestly the bowls they serve you have so much food in them and going forward we will most definitely split one. I thought the fish portions were really generous and tasted fresh. I did find the sushi rice to be really mushy and over cooked but other than that I was pretty impressed. I would definitely go back when I'm looking for a quick dining experience."
2/13/2021,4,"3 1/2 stars. A good lunch with huge portions.  I'm a fan of bento boxes. Compartments with little bits of different foods to mix and match. Only in this case, it was large amounts different foods. You choose your meat (or tofu or shrimp) and your sauce plus white or brown rice. Each box comes with sauteed green string beans, a crisp salad with ginger dressing, and warm low mein noodles. In the middle of the box was a ""dessert"" - - crispy fried noodles with sugar and cinnamon on them. My choice of main dish was the chicken with yellow curry. It was very aromatic and had a very slight kick. In addition to copious amounts of white meat chicken breast, were carrots, green beans, zucchini, and bell peppers. It was very tasty. My husband ordered their sushi combo box. It included  an 8 piece California roll, plus his choice of two of their 4-piece classic sushi rolls. There were over a dozen choices. He also had a smaller portion of salad and some cold veggie (zucchini) topped with a miso dressing. in the box. His combo was a very large portion for the price ($12). If you don't want a large meal, they have build your own poke bowls; signature and classic sushi rolls, rice and noodle.bowls. They also have build your own boba teas/drinks. And they even have a kids meal. They were quite busy during lunch. Lots of college kids and business people in the area plus you can order and pay online. Then pickup. There is inside seating and a patio area outside, too. You order and pay at the counter and are given a number to display on your table. They deliver your meal to you. I wasn't familiar with this chain. Thank you to Howard H., fellow yelper elite, for eating here and intriguing me with his review to bookmark this location. It was a very good experience."
8/6/2022,2,"Ordered take out/ with me picking it up.  Service was slow getting checked out and food was over cooked and not that good.  I would give them a 2nd chance, not sure when."
3/4/2022,4,"Torn between 3 and 4 stars. Food was good and nicely plated! My sushi were way too salted for some reason though. My fiancé really liked his chicken. As for negatives, we had to wait for a long time for our food although it was not busy. And the prices are insanely high for what you get. The restaurant is nice and clean inside though and has a nice patio seating. Overall it was a nice lunch but we will probably not return."
2/19/2022,5,"Fresh delicious food, clean place, friendly staff. They have a hand washing station! But my favorite thing is the food."
8/19/2021,4,I just love my poké bowl full of salmon and full of sauces and fruits. They fulfilled that craving of mine without me asking. They also satisfied one of the most important aspects of a poké bowl: good and generous portion. They left me with a full stomach and a subsequent and much needed food coma. Will be coming back and try out other items on the menu for sure.
8/6/2022,1,"The food and menu looks good but don't be fooled! I got a sushi order with the scallops and was up all night vomiting. (I was unhappy with myself for ordering scallops in a place like that and thought It was my own bad decision and a fluke). But then, a few weeks later, my daughter got chicken chow mein and was up all night vomiting. Health department needs to look into this place. Will never go back."
6/23/2021,3,Bento box with chicken red curry was OK!Having rice and noodles in the same box is a bit of a mistake but the curry was super spicy and had a generous amount of chicken (too much carrot). Udon noodle bowl with tofu and broccoli was over cooked and barely edible.  I feel that it's possible to order better food with a knowledge of what's good on the menu. If you are either smart or lucky it's a cheap meal with a lot of choices.
1/9/2022,5,I've eaten here before and the food is great but my customer service experience was great.  I made a mistake in my order and they fixed it for me with a smile even though I know it could've been a pain in the butt. Great service goes a long way.  Thank you Bento!!! I will be back!!!
9/17/2022,5,Awesome family deal!   Healthy and great family will love it!  Katsu chicken is our favorite
12/30/2019,3,"This is a good place for lunch. You can make your own bento bowl, salad or get sushi! As wellas Bobo tea! You go up to the cashier to place your order and they give you a number for your table and you sit down and they bring it to you. Very casual but very good. It's good for all ages as well. It's in the same strip mall as Yoke, Prezzos and Burton's. It is reasonably priced so tang is nice. I just wish they would do an app and a loyalty program. That would make it even better."
12/22/2019,4,"I'm stopped in here for dinner after leaving the nearby CycleBar class. On Friday night, the restaurant was moderately busy, with many people placing To-Go orders.  I love the build your own bowl options, but I opted for the Hawaiian Poke Bowl, with half rice and half salad. The portion was quite large, and everything was fresh and tasty. Overall, I think it's a nice place for a quick lunch or dinner, and I love that there are some healthy options."
11/30/2019,5,"Came here a while back for lunch with a few coworkers.  This place is located in a busy plaza with different restaurants.  The original plan is to come by around 11:30am, but when by the time we arrived around noon, the line was all the way from inside the restaurant to the street.But I think it's worth the wait.  It could take an average dinner to go through their menus as they all sorts of different items from ramen, shsui to lunch bentos (duh...).  Not sure if there was a vegetarian option, but there rarely are in Asian restaurants.I decided to go with their chicken katsu, or fried pork chop.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful while the outside was crispy.  I also love their rice, it might sound simple but its not easy to make it hot, moist and fluffy.Overall it was a good, quick lunch option.  Everyone at the lunch enjoyed their food.  The staff was friendly and the line moving pretty quick while turning a lot of tables.  I'd definitely go back but may wanted to get there a bit earlier next time."
1/20/2021,5,"Whoops, I was too hungry to take a picture before I ate but it was delicious. Had a make your own poke bowl tonight and split a volcano roll. They had prepackaged utensils and sauces safely packaged. Would recommend the poke bowls."
12/7/2021,1,The food is mediocre at best but now they went cashless so don't bother trying to come here unless you have a credit card I guess they discriminate against people who can't have credit cards or bank accounts
12/7/2021,1,I sent my son here because he didn't want fresh kitchen. They refused cash payment. Cash is legal tender in this country & I feel this is discrimination..what about people who work for cash tips? Also what about people with bad credit who don't have a credit card? Shameful in this day & age..will never go here again & will let everyone we know not to go here
8/29/2019,4,"We have been to the Bento location in Davie maaaaany times while living out there and were always a fan, so we were happy to go here while house hunting in the Boca area. Bento is fast casual Asian food and has something for just about everyone which makes it an easy place to pick when you're in one of your ""I don't know what I want to eat"" moods.Both times we went they had signs they were still in their soft opening. serbice the second time was a little slower than our first which was interesting. I work in the area and although I haven't been during lunch rush I'd recommend calling/ordering ahead to make things easier. As for the food, 9 out of 10 times I pick a build your own poke bowl since it's fully customizable. You can pick rice (brown or white) or mixed greens for your base. Then you select your proteins, veggies (avocado isn't extra!), add-ons (think sesame seeds, cream cheese, etc) and your sauce. Meanwhile my husband sticks to their TNT roll - he likes how the fish on top is ""flamed"". But another reason I'm a fan of Bento is because they have boba tea! Getting boba in South FL is no easy feat so I can appreciate when it is offered. (But just a note - I'm no expert or purist on the boba tea topic but it tastes good and that's all I care about.)Hopefully service can be streamlined a bit more and it would be cool if they brought in a Freestyle Coke machine like their Davie location ;-)"
4/8/2022,1,"""Bento box"" more like shit box. Ordered the teriyaki chicken, was not cooked and no sauce. Rice was not cooked at all! Any Asian cuisine that can't cook teriyaki chicken shows a lot about the place."
4/3/2022,1,If I could leave zero stars I would.  It's been a while since I've eaten anything so disgusting. Drenched with sauce and no flavor. The Edamame was barley tolerable. Save your money.
2/12/2021,4,"Dine In is now open!Plenty of Inside and outside seating available.This new Asian food eatery has plenty of options for Sushi - Bento - Bowl creations and you will leave full and satisfied!Today for lunch I chose one of the Sushi Boxes: 8 pieces of California roll, I chose the Special Mexican roll and Florida roll to round out my order.The Special Mexican roll had Shrimp tempura, steamed shrimp, avocado,  masago, spicy mayo, cream cheese and eel sauce. The Florida roll had tuna, salmon, cucumber, cream cheese and masago. The box also had cubed zucchini and a nice salad. The California roll was good too, and with the eight pieces of California roll to go along with the four Special Mexican and four Florida roll pieces, was a lot of food!The staff is friendly and if you dine inside they give you a  numbered flag for delivery to your table when your order is ready.They do have bottled beers, cans of hard seltzer, bottled water, juices and sodas. (The fountain drinks machine was not in operation this visit so we shared a canned soft drink).There is a condiments counter where you can gather soy packets, (regular or low sodium), chopsticks,  straws, napkins, take out boxes, salt and pepper This place also looks to be popular with the young college/university set in the area. When you are hungry, lunch or dinner, this is definitely the place to come!"
2/2/2020,3,"Ordering was a bit confusing at the register since it was our first visit.  We ordered Chicken Padthai and a Poke bowl.  For a drink, we ordered a Boba Tea with popping bobas.  The drink was great.  Poke Bowl was a bit on the salty side, but plenty of fish.  The Padthai was too spicy.  Not quite the right place for us, but good to try."
3/6/2021,5,"On this particular Friday night we didn't intend on going to Bento Asian kitchen but we were so happy we did!  This restaurant is located in a strip plaza on Military Trail just north of Yamato.  This is a quick service restaurant, you walk up to the counter and order, they give you a number and they bring the food to you.  My wife and I both got bento boxes for dinner, I got the general tso's chicken and she got a garlic chicken.  We really didn't know what to expect but these ""boxes"" were huge!  They come with noodles a choice of white or brown rice and a salad. They also have different types of sushi and boba teas.  We both got the Thai Tea boba tea and for 24oz it was $5.50.  For the kids we got them the kids meals which were also quite large.  They both enjoyed their food and finished it all.  We will definitely go back!!!"
1/12/2021,5,"Super fresh, super clean and an extra nice staff who are very accommodating and always properly masked! Everything we've had here has been excellent. I'm someone that will only eat Sushi at spots that are extremely fresh and this is. Some of the things I really like about eating here and makes me recommend it is that they have something for any time of day. Wether its a quick snack of edamame, dumplings or a 4pc sushi roll, a lighter meal of one of their mini-Poke bowls or a full combination Bento Box with sushi, a hot entree & side, this a great spot any time of day. Their Milk Teas with or without Boba are also an excellent sweet treat. I also like that for a casual dining place they have a fairly extensive menu and their protein selection is excellent. I don't remember them all but there are 5 different Salmon choices (Regular, smoked, Poke marinated, Spicy & Teriyaki) Tuna, Yellow Tail, Krab, Egg, Tofu and more. Everything we have eaten here so far, we would have again. We catered a small party of 8 on New Year's Eve from here and everyone raved about it. So if you're looking for something different or something new, I highly recommend trying Bento."
5/14/2022,5,"I've had complaints in the past, but this place really has it together. Good luck picking something on the menu, because it's all good. You have a tough choice there, but I recommend the yellow curry rice bowl."
2/18/2021,5,"Disclosure: I'm Asian so I'm picky AF when it comes to Asian food.  For lunch I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it was so yummy.  A bonus is that, with tax it was under $10 (cheaper than the menu pictures on Yelp).  The food took about 5 minutes to make and the portions were huge; about 40% bigger than I probably needed as a grown man.  I can't wait to come back and try other menu items."
10/8/2019,4,"Came by yesterday for lunch with Orphan George and Orphan Rick after hearing that this place opened up in Boca from my boys as we had been to a similar one in Davie FL.I was quite excited to hear it was local and upon entering we found it very well lit and decor was nice and modern.When you enter you pick up a menu that is extensive and can be a bit confusing but for the first timers I would highly recommend the Bento Box as a starter which has a white or brown rice, green beans, a salad with ginger dressing, crispy fried triangles lol and noodles as your base, then you order your main course and it is added to the box and that way you get to flavor a little of everything.George ordered the Sesame Chicken, Rick had the Gen Tso's chicken and I had the Katsu Chicken with the yellow curry sauce (served separately) and all our meals were delicious.  Soft drinks are available on tap and refills are free (they could however do with a bit better variety)!All in all we had a very good meal and decently priced even though it was in ""the Boca"".  I would definitely give this place a thumb's up for my fellow Yelpers and will definitely be back with the rest of the Orphans and the family."
3/8/2021,4,"There is indoor dining and the place is really neat. The food here is pretty good for its price. It's not exactly the tastiest asian food i've had but it's not bad either. I do like their chicken with rice or noodles a lot better than their sushi. I feel like it's better ""quality"". I am a really big fan of their milk tea. I really like the strawberry flavor with strawberry boba."
4/20/2021,5,"This food taste amazing! Establishment is very clean, well mannered employees and again, the food was amazing. I had a poke bowl, made with love! Will always order when in town!"
7/2/2020,5,We went here because we were craving Asian food and our favorite place had closed. We got the Orange bento box and sesame chicken stir fry. Both were amazing and the strawberry soda was very different. It's different because there's a marble that you push out the cap that's in the drink. Overall very good food and would definitely go back.
11/19/2019,3,Decided to try something new so we came here. Atmosphere is very nice and everything was very clean.  While ordering we were a little confused how to order and got really not directions on how to. We order the kids meal for my daughter and she loved it! I got a bento box which I loved also. I also got a honey boba tea. My drink didn't come out until I actually went back up to the cashier to get it (which was sitting on the counter for how ever long). I was a little upset because I asked the waiter where the drink was and he told me he would go find out. We had already finished the meal before we got it. The drink was definitely a green tea but the cashier insisted that it was honey dew. They offered to make a new one but I didn't want to wait any longer. We left it there. Food was great but I think the staff needed a little more training and better customer service.
5/20/2021,1,"They give you enough food, unfortunately the boba tea tastes horrible. The noodles remind me of linguini noodles and tasted nasty. The Korean salad was far from a Korean salad. The main course in the box (Korean) was decent. Sadly I won't be coming back. For the price it was a big disappointment."
7/4/2021,1,"Unorganized and unprofessional staff. Waited 30 minutes for my food when my last 15 minutes I was the only customer in the store. No one came to explain why it was taking so long it just seemed like the norm. No explanation upon request for refund either. The management in the store at this time should be switched or I'm not sure how this place will stay open. The foods not even all that good, I just went cos it was one of 2 restaurants open in the area on the holiday."
9/12/2019,5,"This is brand new at this location. I LOVE this place. (Mom and I ate at the one in Tallahassee)The food is fresh and plentiful.  Staff was very nice, and food came out fast and hot. It takes a while to place your order, because if you haven't eaten there before, the person at the register has to explain to you how it's done. The food I'd NOT over salted."
4/11/2020,5,I ordered a delivery and I was surprised how quickly the order arrived and still warm.The udon soup was delicious and the teriyaki rice also delicious both a large serving. We also had spring rolls which were crispy but not greasy.Door dash is the only way I would order.
8/23/2020,1,"Oufff, first time ever ordering from Bento and this is what I see when I'm pretty much done with it, eww, where is the quality control, not just 1 but 2 items that shouldn't be in my food. 1 white string and 1 long piece of plastic. Grossed out, the food was good but this unacceptable."
3/10/2021,5,"Ordered take out for lunch a few times. Tried their Mongolian beef with rice , pad Thai and coconut curry. I liked all of those dishes. I was surprised how good they were. I have yet to try the sushi but I think this is an amazing place to have lunch."
3/7/2021,3,"I have a sweet spot for Bento from going here weekly in college. But this location is very hit or miss for me. The food is inconsistent. Sometimes prepared differently or with substituted ingredients. For takeout, the wait times are never accurate. It's been a year into this pandemic and their soda fountain is still not open? So you're forced to buy a water bottle for 25 cents. My meal is typically very dry so I get stuck buying an extra sauce for 50 cents. I'll still keep coming here occasionally but it's definitely not as good as I remember or want it to be. Fun fact: each entree comes with a free sauce, it's not advertised at all but it does."
11/19/2019,5,"So happy that Bento finally opened a location in the Boca area. I can now get my fix in of Pao Pao Chicken (Spicy Cream) without having to drive to Davie. Been to this location multiple times already and couldn't be more pleased. Super consistent, fast and tasty every time!"
10/5/2019,4,"I don't venture this far often but I got a reason to now! I had a mixed greens poke bowl with spicy tuna and Asian Cajun steak. I added asparagus, jalapeños, cream cheese, mango, and avocado. Then I topped it with fried garlic and pickled ginger. Lastly I added yuzu ponzu. I have not been that quite eating a ""salad"" in a long time. It was truly delicious. One thing I really loved about the restaurant was the hand washing station. Having a wild boy it's always great to have a spot to wash his hands quickly because I never know what he has touched or played with. However, the staff was unwilling to let me sample the sauces while ordering my food or my sons. And the dish that children's meals are served in slip and slide all over the table. I had to really make sure he did not accidentally knock it off the table."
6/14/2021,5,One of my favorite spots when I'm around the Boca area. Food is always fresh and place is always clean.
6/10/2021,2,The food is pretty good but with recent price hikes I don't think it's worth it is now almost 17 dollars for a full meal without a drink. There portions also seem to be smaller. The staff there is nice and helpful but it's not a reasonable value for the new pricing.
3/3/2020,5,"I have not been WOWED by a restaurant in a while, but Bento wowed me! The food was absolutely amazing. The Mongolian Beef Bento Box is my new jam! Everything on the plate was fantastic! The quality is great, portions are perfect and the service is quick! Love love love it!!"
9/8/2019,5,"I've been to a few locations in Orlando and absolutely love Bento! Food is decently priced, efficient  and it's in a great location in park plaza. This will definitely become a favorite for the Boca community. The restaurant is modern with plenty of inside and outside seating. When you walk in you see a menu and wait in line to order at the counter. They give you a number so the staff can bring out your meal. Their menu includes sushi, poke bowls, combo boxes and on the other side of the menu sides, soups, noodle or rice bowls, boba teas. It looks like they will have a selection of beer coming soon! I'm so excited for Bento to be opening more locations here in south florida. I usually always get the sushi combo box but now that it is closer to home, I can try more menu items."
2/1/2021,4,"The pao pao shrimp/chicken is great 85% of the time. The lost star is for the inconsistency. But when it's good, it's really good."
5/30/2020,4,Good clean fresh fish.  Rice was perfect.Smaller portion size - not fat guy compatible.
10/22/2020,1,"I placed an online order, arrived 10 minutes earlier than the estimated time and was told that the order was not ready and it should be a few minutes.  Waited 20 minutes and out of frustration asked again how much longer only to find out my order was there waiting the whole time. This was my first time visiting and my meal is cold and soggy. With an empty restaurant and full staff I would expect better service."
8/29/2019,4,"Now that my local Pei Wei has been replaced I had to go search for another Asian to go restaurant as my go to. You walk up and pick a base with a protein and a style (ie curry, teriyaki, general Tao etc). I opted for the bento box (it's called bento for a reason I guess?) with chicken and yellow curry. I noticed they had boba tea and as a boba tea lover I had to try one. Matcha with boba it is! The wait was quick only about 10 mins or so, the staff was less enthusiastic however it was not rush time so I don't really blame them, kinda boring. Upon sitting down a worker came up to me and told me they ran out of boba, bummer..I ordered the popping boba (lychee) instead with a matcha milk tea. Overall everything was good nothing spectacular but at the price range I can't really complain, most likely I'll visit them again..maybe for a poke bowl? Or sushi!"
8/20/2021,5,"Delicious food. I always go to the breakfast place right next to this place and whenever I passed it I always wanted to try. So glad I did. I love Asian food and making my own bento boxes. It was super convenient and the food tasted real good. The price is great too, a lot cheaper than I thought it would be."
9/15/2019,4,"Nice selection of preconfigured ""from the kitchen"" items or build your own bowl. Boba tea choices were real as well.Will definitely be back!"
10/23/2020,4,Neat small chain with very good menu. Have been picking up in Boca for lunch and the rice and noodle bowls are very tasty. Bento box a plus. Sushi and rolls and also good value and portion.
7/8/2021,3,"The bowl I ordered was very good, however, DO NOT order the SUSHI. I have had better from the 7/11 dumpster. All in all if you avoid the sushi you will have a very pleasant experience however if you make the mistake I did you will be less than satisfied."
10/14/2019,3,"Came here for lunch today for the first time, the cashier/server didn't give much instruction and guidance on how the menu works, I was rushed to pick the first thing I saw. I had a bento with curry Tofu, the food was subpar: chips (?) and stir fried noodles were staled with a funny taste, sting beans were half-cooked, the curry lacked flavor. Will come back again to give it another try and update this review."
5/10/2021,1,"Ordered some poke bowls for pickup and received very small portions (they filled less than half of the bowls) and some ingredients were missing. Also, the salmon wasn't fresh. I don't recommend this place."
6/6/2021,1,This was the slowest restaurant on earth.  They have no idea what they are doing.  Negative 5 stars for service.
4/9/2021,3,Food ok but they raised prices about $2 or more a dish. I think a bit expensive for basically fast food.
9/25/2020,1,"Not very accommodating, would not let me get sides I wanted for the bento box and I was willing to pay extra also. The sesame chicken wasn't breaded and their menu didn't state so when I got it I tried to return it because it's not what I wanted but they denied my exchange. Poor service also."
8/11/2019,4,The food was pretty good.  The inside was very loud because of the echos.  We ended up sitting outside.
9/28/2019,3,Good food. But they are really slow. Asked for a regular poke bowl and waited more that 30 minutes!!!!!Not sure I'll come back.
5/18/2020,5,Loved this place every time I went to Orlando I would make sure to get Bento. I was so happy when i found out they were brining it to Boca! You must try the Boba tea. Also recommend the sushi bento boxes and the poke bowls!
1/9/2020,3,"Was taken here by my boss for a lunch catch-up and I was excited as I had never been.  As much as I want to say I loved it and can't wait to go back, I'd change a couple of things if I did return.  The atmosphere was so loud it literally felt like I was shouting at my boss in line and then started to lose my voice a bit, bizarre.  We got as far away from the crowd as we could just so we could have a decent conversation.  There were no napkins on the table and although we ordered together, we didn't receive our food at the same time - and her food wasn't correct to what she ordered.  The food itself was good, although not enough protein in the bowl in comparison to everything else that was included.  I wasn't disappointed at all, just not blown away enough to put it on my ""must return"" lists.  The spicy tofu WAS something that may pull me back in....."
12/25/2020,5,Food is excellent and pricing is very reasonable! The pao pao chicken and the poke bowls are our favorites. This is our go to spot.
3/7/2021,1,"This is not the spot to go to if you're Asian and accidentally standing on the wrong line.  We were there earlier today, a few minutes before two very entitled rude racist older white men.  We were just accidentally standing in the wrong line (should have paid attention to the signs on the floor, but didn't).  The cashier closer to the fridge and exit door saw us there and acknowledged that we were there before the so-not-gentlemen but still sided with these undesirable characters instead of doing the right thing.  These two men lied... we saw them going in, and they saw us standing on the wrong line.  A quick look at the CCTV would have shown who were right.. Yeah, we walked out after experiencing such excellent customer service though the other register:cashier asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager.  Why should we be subjected to such treatment while the two very nice men were still serviced? Why would they allow such negativity toward other customers?  So yeah, we walked out because we didn't want to be victims.  We called and spoke to the store manager named Emily to ensure she's aware of this incident.  While she said that she would make things right if we were to give it a try next time; they left nothing to be desired to come back."
3/14/2021,2,"The food from this place is great. However, the delivery system at your location in Boca Raton, on Military Trail, is bad. We ordered yesterday and the food didn't come. We ordered today and the food didn't come. And happened again at least two times in the last month. Folks, you have to fix how the food is delivered otherwise you will start to lose customers . Where was the food delivered all those times, because was obviously not ""delivered"" to the one who ordered it . Today was Ursula in charge to bring the food. She didn't."
11/14/2019,3,"Have picked up and ate here a couple of times.  Food has been ok. The first time I ordered to go the lady on the phone told me 15 to 20 minutes and it took over 40 minutes for my poke bowl to be ready. Today I ordered from Uber eats (poke bowl) and fish didn't taste fresh.Also in the store you get to choose 5 toppings and on Uber eats only allows 4 , when I put a note to please add ginger they didn't do it."
12/6/2019,1,"We got here at 11:15. We've been in line and it's 11:40. They are not efficient at all. This is ridiculous!!!*UPDATE*They brought our food out. One at a time. 15 mins apart. I guess you can only get takeout from this slum. From the manager ""our concept is to bring out food as it's ready"" so you want people to eat separately?"
10/17/2019,1,"The food is OK but it doesn't make up for the awful customer service I ordered my food at 11:28 at 11:55 my food is still not ready so I asked How much longer because I am going to be late back to work and I'm unable to eat my food...the manager is unwilling to help and they forgot my dumplings until I asked where my food was I was told the dumplings take longer because they're deep-fried I just watch the chefs throw them in and a deep fry doesn't take 30 minutes, the manager didn't know how to handle the situation and I would not recommend this location to anyone"
10/11/2019,1,We have been going to Bento Gainesville and Davie for years now and so excited when the Boca Raton location opened.  Unfortunately on first and second try it has not been the same experience.  Today I ordered a standard Poke Bowl with greens.  The order was placed and I was told after 20 minutes of waiting that they ran out of greens.  They offered to make a bowl with rice or noodles and I was ok with the changes. As another 10 minutes went by I asked where the order was and was told they where still making it.   Unacceptable!   I asked for a refund which was completed and yet the order had not been finished. You would think that after waiting for 20 minutes and having to make a order change that the corrected one would have been expedited.   I hope that the Boca location works out there issues and let's everyone know.  M
9/28/2019,4,"Clean location and fair price point for sushi orders. Only issue is with the waiting time as I haven't ever seen it extremely busy, however with an order ahead option I should be able to be in and out quicker in future visits."
1/17/2020,5,I really liked this place. The variety is great and there's plenty of seating. The person that took my order helped me out alot (it was my first time) the food was good! I also got chocolate boba.
2/19/2021,5,"I love coming to this location, it's always so clean and the atmosphere is great.  The food is always great, the staff is super friendly and Emily is always so helpful!"
8/13/2019,5,"Used to work at bento when I lived in Orlando. I was part of their opening staff at UCF and I've loved their food ever since! Couldn't wait till they opened up in my hometown area. I visited during soft opening and it was just as good as I remember. So happy! Red curry udon noodle bowl, special Mexican and red dragon are my go-tos. Boba is good too!"
2/8/2021,1,I ordered the orange chicken lo mein. The chicken was soggy and it did not taste good.
12/22/2019,4,Good homogenized chain Korean Bento Box experience. Pleasant seating outside. Newer opened restaurant getting up to speed. No beer or Saki yet. I've had better experience at different location but they'll pull it all together as it's a good brand for many thing Asian. Sushi was fine. Korean was as expected but don't expect authentic Korean experience with numerous sides.
1/28/2020,1,First time tonight. Horrible experience. Staff really tried and was very nice.  My dinner came out waited for my husbands.  Finally we asked and were told they were out of white rice. Really?? So told them brown rice was fine. Waited and waited. I finally went and asked for manager. Waited and waited. Apparently Caroline was too busy to speak to us so we left. Have never experienced a mismanaged business like this. Will never return or recommend. A shame.
1/26/2020,4,"It seems to have become our default  spot for a quick bite. Love the options of the Poké, the specials and definitely love the Boba drinks.We've tried the Poke bowls, the bento boxes and some of the specials and not been disappointed.Definitely worth a visitt if you are in the area and in the mood for a quick bite."
7/20/2020,2,They have open only to eat outside. The tables are dirty and the trash is full while personnel is Inside with a lot of time waist.
1/14/2020,4,"I order form here all the time. They've messed up my order about twice and I was furious about it.  The manager called and made it up to me for their mistake and handled it like a professional. Most places don't handle these situations so well so I never care to go back. Bento is all around good unless they short you on the protein in your order. The manager was a stand up guy, took care of me. Which showed that Bento has more than just good food to offer. I put 4 stars because the last two times I ordered I was given very close to little chicken again. But other than that, this specific bento location is amazing"
3/13/2020,4,Yummy in my tummy. Perfectly prepared to what I ordered. The steak was perfectly cooked and the vegetables were a good combination with the noodles I choose. I will return upon my next visit to Florida since you have yet to be anywhere else.
10/2/2019,5,"Every time I've gone here so far, the food has been fresh and delicious! The wait times have been extremely short, although I have a tendency to go during irregular hours. I've tried their regular dishes, their poké bowls, and their bubble teas and have enjoyed both the food quality and the aesthetic  presentation. The staff have been polite and courteous, even if they are new to the job or if there's been a mistake (I once accidentally left without part of my order, but they got it to me immediately when I came back in). This is a very new location as of when I'm writing this review, so I hope they keep up the great work! :)"
8/21/2019,2,I know that this location is new but the service was subpar. Took forever to get our food and we had 3 people at our table with everyone getting their food at different Times in a 20 minute window. We asked multiple times about our orders and the staff seemed totally confused. Hopefully they can fix the service as customers were frustrated waiting on food.
12/19/2019,5,Ordered the pao pao chicken bowl and a ten piece sushi roll and it was absolutely amazing. This is the spot for sure.
1/29/2020,4,It gets real crowded at lunch and sometimes hard to find a table but the beef teriyaki bento boxes are awesome.
11/21/2019,1,"It is impossible to screw up consecutive orders. Therefore, your are intentionally incompetent. I'll kill myself before I eat there again."
10/3/2019,3,"I've tried a few things here and am just not crazy about anything. Nothing is really that good. It's quick cheap(ish) Chinese food. I don't like how on the check out screen when it asks for a tip, it makes it pretty confusing and complicated to say ""no"" because there isn't any option to say no. You have to click ""other"" and then press enter. It's annoying and I think they did that on purpose."
8/8/2019,2,If you like really greasy food then this is the place for you. I ordered some sort of veggie bowl which I thought would be healthy and I asked for tofu which they told me they only have fried tofu so I passed on the tofu. When my order came it was just really loaded with greasy vegetables (and not many). I guess this place is just not for me.
12/19/2019,2,DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU ARE GLUTEN FREE OR VEGAN. The staff looks at you like you have 3 heads when you even mention the concept of a gluten free or vegan menu or just lie to you because they have no clue. I went here on 4 separate occasions every time they got my order wrong and had to remake it or told me that something was gluten free later to find out it really  wasn't. Finally the manager got Involved and told me that all of the products come into contact with meat and gluten except for the rice. Don't waste your time the place isn't fresh it's all processed and sent from a factory. SIDE NOTE when I was not gluten free or vegan the spicy cream chicken with udon noodles is amazing even though it leaves you with a stomach ache after
9/21/2020,1,Took almost 15 minutes longer than expected. The lady at the cashier was super rude and unhelpful and ALL 3 cooks in kitchen had their nose sticking out of the mask. I am super disappointed.
9/21/2019,3,"The place looks great, great location and ambiance. I went with my son. He ordered a sushi box and I ordered the Mongolian beef over rice. My order came relatively fast, the portion was a good size, but just like another reviewer said. It's quantity over quality and for the price 5 spices at yamato is way better. After about 15 minutes my son's sushi had arrived. No wasabi or ginger was included which when you eat sushi is a must have. We had to ask for it and they brought it to our table. The place was kind of empty so not sure why they would forget to add it to the box.I may give it another chance, but it was disappointing.If paying with a credit card the system ask for the tip, you have to click other if you don't want to leave a tip, I gave a tip before I eat my food! I did have a good impression when I entered the place, but left with a bad impression."
8/28/2019,3,"Good food but you have to wait forever for it and you pay for the quality for sure. They also ask for a tip when you pay with a credit card and to not leave a tip you have to find the ""other"" button and type in 0. Makes you feel bad on purpose for not tipping which is a pet peeve of mine. Bento should pay their employees, not have them rely on tips. I should tip because of good service, not try to be forced into it and then proceed to wait for 15 minutes for my food."
10/16/2019,5,"Best bento bowls in town. The Pao Pao chicken has so much flavor! Also try the seasonal Zombie Roll, it's amazing Will be back soon!"
10/31/2019,1,"Wanted extra avocado, didn't get much at all. Didn't get much of anything Overpriced. Food not terrible. I went back a second time and I totally regretted it. I watched as the line cook prepare my food and he kept wiping his gloves on a dirty rag that kept touching the trash. Totally grossed me out."
4/29/2020,1,Hi I'm trying to order over the phone but it hangs up as soon as I press 1. I don't want to order online because door dashed prices are increased.
11/1/2019,1,If you want Asian food this is not the place. Everything on my plate was unappetizing and tasted terrible. The lo Mein and schezuan chicken were the worst part.
10/14/2019,5,Excellent!! Highly recommend! Great food with very reasonable prices! Service was great and they were happy to make substitutions when requested! We will be back for sure!
11/11/2019,2,"We wanted to like Bento, because it's close to our house and we love Asian food.   We ordered 4 dishes to share, pork egg rolls, fried dumplings, Bento box with broccoli/tofu and Sesame stir fry with beef.  The pork rolls were not hot, very average.  The fried dumplings were overcooked, very dry, didn't finish them.  The bento box broccoli/tofu was overwhelmed by the strong, dark sauce (seemed like the exact same sauce in the beef stir fry.   The salad in the bento box was wilted and dressing too sweet.   Also, our main courses were delivered first and as we were halfway thru them, the appetizers arrived.   Overall, all of the food had a 'too sweet' taste and all kind of tasted the same.    Disappointed and will not return."
10/4/2019,5,I'm so happy there's finally one close to me. I used to drive 45 minutes to David every once in a while. It should buy out every other fast food ish Asian restaurant (like Pei Wei). I get the teriyaki chicken bento box with extra rice and no salad. I can't believe they have yum yum/white sauce. Amazing place.
9/11/2019,1,Very disappointed because the location in Davie was excellent.  Food just okay. They don't serve brewed ice tea like Davie and have an  ordinary soda machine. The davie one has a great soda machine with lots of variety to add flavors etc. not inclined to go back but will visit Davie again.
10/9/2020,3,"don't take this personal, this is Constructive criticism ..you cannot served hot food in a plastic container, it makes the food taste like plastic ,, besides , its a potential health risks , i saw one of your employee stir a entire bucket of hot rice inside a plastic bus tub, ??? you are suppose to use a metal or glass container, i know that due to the Virus, you guys serve food in plastic containers, but the right way to do it, is to put a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the plastic container so that your food does not taste like plastic..."
8/15/2019,5,"This new location in Boca Raton is a dream come true. I have visited their other locations when I am traveling in the state of Florida, but was finally happy that Bento is finally in Boca Raton. Their food is great and the service was great. I will visit this location again and again. Keep up the good work and cannot wait to return to this location for amazing food."
10/30/2022,5,"Once again Bento is still amazing! I just ordered the veggie stir fry with chicken and rice and it was out of this world! It's not fried which is a plus and it has a great variety of veggies that it comes with. The portion was also perfect so it definitely does not disappoint.One new service feature from this visit is they now have a menu screen to order from. This allows you to see a visual of all the items included in your order, and since I'm a visual person it makes the experience all the better. The food was also brought out super quickly so I was very surprised!I also ordered the Pick 2 Poke Bowl since I have been broadening my horizons in the world of Poke! I got the soy salmon and soy tuna as bases with rice. Then for toppings I got cucumbers, edamame, seaweed salad, kimchi, ginger, sesame seeds and avocado. The kimchi and seaweed salad choices really made this bowl stand out so I was surprised. Overall, Bento continues to be a great experience. I love the food and I wish there were more around so I don't have to drive so far to go to one"
9/15/2022,2,"Vegans/Vegetarians beware!!Been here two times. First time was good. I got the avocado roll and tofu bento box. Second time was not good.Here's the negative for me: I ordered a tofu bowl. Tofu is very dense and chewy. First time I went it was the same way. Very difficult to eat. Sauce has good flavor though. Found some pieces of chicken in my bowl. I am vegan and don't consume chicken. This completely ruined my appetite. I understand they cater to all eaters and I am grateful for that, but I am a little disappointed that extra care is not taken to prevent mixing meat and tofu. Don't think I'll be coming back."
9/3/2022,3,"I believe this was my third time coming to Bento and I have to say that the food did not disappoint today. The past couple of times I ordered sushi and I'd say it's probably not my favorite thing to order. So today, I decided to go with something different. Today I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. It was quite delicious! I was going to have it as a combo, but their soda fountain was not working and they wouldn't give us the option to order it as a combo with a bottled drink. I decided to order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Honey boba, which was not the greatest. I also ordered a side of edamame. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Lo Mein and that is probably what I'll be ordering next time as it was fantastic! Overall, staff is nice, atmosphere is comfortable and the food is good."
11/30/2022,4,"The girl at the register was nice, I was surprised how empty this location was but it was a weekday. Restaurant seems very clean and food was tasty. I ordered the pao pao chicken with lo mien noodles and my daughter ordered Mongolian steak which ended up accidentally getting chicken but she was happy with it and the staff was kind and ready to correct the mistake. We will be returning"
9/3/2022,3,"If you are in the area and are craving some thing Asian, this is the spot for you!  I've been here before and usually get the bento box, but today I decided to have something different. I decided to try the Shanghai lo mein noodles with chicken as my protein.  My dish was amazing, it was not spicy and the ingredients blended so well.  My girlfriend had the Pad Thai and she liked hers too, but said that mine tasted better. I will have to agree with her on that observation.Now I usually get a combo when I come over but today their soda machine was down and I was told that due to to that, they could not give me a combo, which consists of a fountain drink and a side. I wish that they could have accommodated us with still giving us the combo options but substitute the fountain drink with a bottle drink.I hope to have a better experience the next time I come by."
10/24/2022,4,"I have passed by this place many times and finally decided to try it. I ordered the bento box which came with rice, lo mein, ginger salad, garlic string beans and your choice of protein or veggies.  For my protein I picked the Sichuan chicken. The food and service was good."
7/19/2022,4,"Yummy! Came for lunch with some friends and enjoyed my food! In the pricier end... they've raised their prices.I got the pao pao shrimp, spice level III. I got lo mein with it and it was delicious. I would get this again. I used to get sriracha garlic chicken but I didn't see it. I later saw that they renamed it to the spicy gochujang (fyi)."
6/28/2022,4,"I used to not be a fan of this location, honestly it must have just been a bad day or new chef. But I get that there's a reason for the popularity so I figured I'd try it again and have gone a few times since! For fast casual asian fusion, it's actually really good. My go to choices are the pao pao shrimp with noodles or sushi. That pao pao sauce is basically bang bang sauce but so much more addicting, especially in their super crispy shrimp tempura. Everything is pretty affordable and quick service. Things I'm not so much a fan of are their boba and the fact that there's no booth seating. If I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite it's still a solid option though with great variety."
4/7/2022,3,"I have always really loved eating at Bento and as a college student this place is nearby and most of the time fast. Recently, my experiences were not as good as they had been before. I frequently order the Pao Pao tofu bowl and haven't really had a good time. The bowl flavoring is pretty good, but not as good as before. In addition, I have recently been getting more trouble with my stomach after eating here. I do enjoy the boba teas here and started to order the lychee slush with honey boba. This was a really good option and I would really recommend getting the drinks here!"
4/10/2022,3,"I had the Mongolian beef rice bowl. For $14, I wold have expected more. Maybe 3 ounces of steak, and that's a stretch. The vegetables were mostly the cheap vegetables, onions and scallions. And it's on rice, it's rice,  the worlds most cost effective food. So basically you're paying $14 for onions, scallions, and rice. Also it was heavy on the Mongolian sauce. They also went away with my favorite I've been getting for 20 years now, teriyaki steak! I'll try another dish in couple weeks and see if it was just a bad day."
7/25/2022,4,"Found this Asian spot located in a plaza off 595 & University. Too my surprise it was what I was looking for that day, quick yummy asian bowl. I tried the terriyaki chicken with fried rice & string beans. It was a huge portion enough for two servings, it had great taste. My hubby got the steak with rice, very tasty as well. You order at the entry cashier and food is brought to you. Service was good  & fast, presentation  on point. The only thing is we did not read menu well, they do charge xtra for fried rice & also the steak upgrade, we also added the combo $4.50 xtra. There is lots of options, We will return again for sure."
11/19/2022,2,"Food ok. But they want to pay for more hot sauce. So I have go back and make the line again to pay for, you gotta be joking."
3/16/2022,5,"SUPER TASTY FOOD! They have sushi rolls, poke bowls, chicken, etc. They offer so many different types of food options for all ages. Their tuna tastes so fresh, it's awesome!"
9/1/2022,5,"This location has definitely been a regular spot to eat at for my boyfriend and I. We have tried many different options and each time it hasn't disappointed us! It's a very cozy and chill environment, and their service is so quick! Whether you order ahead or just dine in, it's always so fresh and delicious! We also love how there's a small holder on every table inside that includes chopsticks, it's so convenient! We will definitely still be coming here whenever we crave some sushi and boba drinks!"
7/24/2022,5,"Bento is easily one of my top 3 fast casual dining places in Florida! I have loved pretty much every different plate I have tried here- from sushi, to bento boxes, to rice bowls, to raro smoothies and my personal favorite their Poke bowls! So greasy and so good! Don't forgot to sauce it up! Usually their service is also top notch. I recommend Bento to most of my friends and family, and they have always enjoyed it as much as I have! 10/10 would highly encourage you to try their poke bowls and their raro smoothies"
7/28/2022,4,"Service was great food was ehh ok, good enough to fill the stomach but more fast food like taste in my opinion, place was clean, had the Miami roll thought it would be better but wasn't bad, lacked a little more punch in taste, garlic broccoli chicken was good.  Gochujang Garlic Chicken was great in taste prob their best dish, Give it a try."
10/25/2022,2,"Taste was good. However, what you get in terms of substance (protein) versus the amount of fluff (rice or lettuce) is gastronomic fraud. Its doesn't surpass being a business looking to make a buck. Completely lacks soul. Also staff look miserable. Like zombies. Eating here feels like getting swindled... or transactional sex with a liberal chick that keeps plan B in her purse. Empty and worthless. Will make you appreciate eating at other places."
4/11/2021,4,"We frequent Bento for convenient and tasty takeout. They have easy kids boxes for about $6 like katsu kids box and teriyaki kids box that my 4 year old and 6 year old love.We really enjoy the poke bowls that are a decent portion of fresh fish and veggies at reasonable price at $10 for mini and $14 for regular size.Bento also sells Bento boxes, rice bowls and noodle bowls and seems to be Asian fusion. Dishes range from red coconut curry, spicy beef bulgogi and szechuan box.They also currently have an online family meal special of 4 bowls for $38."
10/8/2021,4,I love ordering from here for dine in or take out. The food is always fresh and absolutely delicious! Their poke bowls are probably one of my top favorite things to order. I recently tried their Zombie roll which is available for a limited time and it was so good! Their fried rice is also great as well. They have a good menu with plenty of options too. Place is clean and staff is friendly and very helpful.
8/31/2022,5,best spicy tuna roll hands down. and i've had LOTS of sushi!!!!! I usually manage to get a deal on uber eats and this place is my go to. i just wish the spicy mayos were a little bigger so i didn't have to order so many
8/11/2022,3,"A little pricey for what it is, but food is relatively fresh and taste is on point. I would recommend the bowls."
8/20/2022,4,We ordered the pineapple sweet and sour chicken with noodles as the base as well as a bento box. Both were delicious! This place is great for some quick asian food. Their menu is pretty expensive as well
11/8/2022,1,Tried to dine in but ended up leaving because I was getting swarmed by fruit flies while trying to eat. Unfriendly staff too. Asked for one of those bigger plastic to-go boxes since my entire meal was uneaten and they just stared at me and were unhelpful.
12/8/2021,5,"We are regular customers of Bento and always enjoy the food; but, this review is for catering only. I ordered the Samurai sushi platter for a holiday party last Saturday and it was the best looking sushi platter I have ever seen. The platter has 64 pieces of sushi (2 rainbow rolls, 2 special Mexican rolls, 2 Mount Fuji rolls, 2 spicy tuna rolls). All of the sushi was fresh and delicious and the garnishes on the platter were amazing. Someone took a lot of time making this platter look great. Unfortunately I didn't get a picture before everyone started digging in. The manager was super friendly during pickup too. They even gave us take home boxes for my guest to use. This location will be my go to catering location for sushi from now on."
11/7/2022,3,Average quick bite. But if you want some better quality go across the street to a real sushi place.
11/18/2020,4,"First time seeing a fast casual sushi spot & it did not disappoint!Combination lunch with side & drink can run a little high ($20) but was it worth it?Yes, food was filling, flavorful & fast. They also have boba tea which I did not get to enjoy but next time!!! Hope to see a location in miami soon.Would definitely take hubby on a lunch date here."
5/24/2021,1,"This review is based solely on takeout, from this past Sunday. My husband called many times to place an order over the phone, but there was no answer. It took him about a 15 minute drive to arrive, so by the time he got there, he hung up the phone and placed the order in person. For years, I've always been able to sub what's in the bento box. But yesterday, my husband was told the menu changed and we are no longer allowed to sub what's in the bento box. Which I still don't believe. My husband ordered us a bento box, a rice bowl and a sushi combo box. After about 10 minutes of waiting, the cashier went over to him and told him it would be an additional 10 minutes. Mind you, there was no one else waiting for their food. He was the only one who was in line and who was waiting for their food. He took notice that our bento box and rice bowl were sitting in the window for about 10 minutes but he was still waiting on our sushi combo box. Now another 20 minutes go by, and he's still waiting. By the time all of our food was packed, it was 40 minutes, with about 30 minutes of our ""hot"" food just sitting in the window. This is totally unacceptable. Our food should be cooked and timed to be packaged, at the same time. Not have one thing ready at one time, and another thing ready at another time. You'd think the restaurant would have noticed and offered to re-make our hot food, but they didn't."
7/30/2022,4,Good fast place for fast dining and good sushi/thai . good prices and fast staff make this a great lunch spot in the area!
5/4/2022,4,"Pork dumplings, are gas. Veggie stir fry is orgasmic. I honestly haven't had anything I wouldn't have again. Thank you for existing and making my hard days at work so much more enjoyable during lunch time."
6/23/2020,4,"As a UF alum, I frequented the original Bento locations in Gainesville. When I discovered the Davie location, it quickly became a dependable restaurant for fast, Asian food. Especially during the pandemic, Bento was proactive in keeping customers updated, releasing discounts/promotions, and following mandated safety guidelines. I always call ahead for my to-go orders, and the food is usually done within 15 minutes.I typically order their build-your-own poke bowls, but have also tried various kitchen items. Although their food is tasty, it definitely lacks authenticity, especially with such a large menu. However, it is easy to find a dish suitable for everyone. My biggest concern is with their portion sizes; I find myself hungry very soon after finishing one of their meals. Although the prices are reasonable, their bowls are mainly comprised of noodles/rice, instead of the meat, fish, etc. Nonetheless, Bento has always been clean and dependable."
9/28/2021,5,"I have been to this location so many times and they never let me down. The front end staff / cashier are excellent, when they take your order they have no problems answering questions about the food or going back to the kitchen quickly to find out more for question they don't know the answer too ,  The food is always consistently delicious and every dish from sushi to hot foods is never let down. Now when it comes to their green beans I do not understand how they make it so fresh and so tasty.Incredible place definitely one of the best chains out there in the state. I do not recommend takeout or delivery especially for hot food with fried chicken in it as the food will get soggy but that's anywhere."
9/14/2021,5,"Ordered a bento katsu bowl from here and sushi roll, it was so delicious highly recommend."
3/12/2020,5,"Thought this would be a nice place to take my grandma to for lunch, especially since she LOVES asian cuisine! Ive been here quite a few times myself and have always tried something different! My grandma ordered the garlic broccoli shrimp brown rice bowl, which she thought was super tasty! Personally, I stick with the udon noodles as my base because they are nice and think and I love the slurp. I was in a vegetarian mood today and went with the tofu, which was nice because it had the right amount of crispiness on the outside! My bowl didn't look like it was oversized and I thought I could finish it all in one sitting, but halfway through, I was stuffed. The portions here are definitely enough to make two meals, so you know you're getting your money's worth. If you dine in, make sure to bring a jacket! It's usually pretty chilly in here."
9/28/2022,1,"Karina is very disrespectful! Said I was ""disrespectful and nasty"" because I asked another employee to remake my drink. I called the store after leaving to leave a complaint and she answered then hung up while I was talking. She's a disgusting dog and needs to be demoted to cleaning toilets until she learns to fix her nasty attitude!"
9/16/2022,3,"The food is okay, but the prices are higher than you would expect from a restaurant with counter service and a fast food feel. For the same price as a roll and a bowl of soup you can go down the road to get all you can eat at Shinju."
6/9/2022,3,MY CHICKEN IS PINK!!! SALMONELLA. not okay at all didn't taste right either. Thank you.
1/7/2020,5,"Thank god I don't have a place like this near my house, or I would be here everyday! The concept of the restaurant is you can choose to have a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box, and then from there you choose what entree (i.e. red curry, bulgogi, teriyaki, etc.) you would like. You can also build your own poke bowl or order some sushi rolls. I ordered some bowls and sushi, and I was thoroughly impressed! Some dishes ordered:mongolian steak: 5/5, extremely flavorful dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was balanced and just the right consistency. The vegetables to meat ratio was spot-on too! Very tasty entree. volcano roll: 5/5, my favorite things in sushi are cream cheese and spicy mayo, so of course I had to order this roll! The imitation crab was fresh, and the baked salmon was a nice touch. Really flavorful roll!!Service: 5/5, I ordered a to-go order, and the servers were so friendly! They quickly brought out my food, and offered to get me any sauces or utensils I needed. I can't wait to visit Florida again just to eat here! I will be back to try everything!"
11/23/2019,4,"This modern asian variety fast casual restaurant located in Davie offers bento boxes, poke bowls, Chinese style dishes, sushi rolls, bobo tea and more. It's fast casual so you line up and order at the front and your meal is then brought to your table. The prices are pretty reasonable and the quality good. I visited for the first time recently and tried the ""Hawaiian Poke Bowl""; the ingredients were fresh and plentiful although it was a tad too salty (most likely too much soy sauce). They also have a build your own option which might be a better wayLooking around I saw a lot of great looking dishes on other people's table and would definitely like to re visit and try some of their other items."
9/26/2021,1,"Unfortunately, I hate leaving reviews like this, working in customer service myself, but needless to say I feel the need to post this.  We walked in and were not greeted in a friendly manner. We asked how to order, and the young lady didn't wish to explain how they worked. She just pointed to the menu without saying anything. We ordered udon noodle soup with chicken Katsu, qnd chicken broth. After ordering, we waited about 10 minutes, and they gave us two large miso soups with udon noodles - while simultaneously we could hear the employees giggling about it behind the counter, creating a hostile customer experience.  From this experience alone, I would highly suggest not wasting your time and  money here. It really sucks to post something so negative especially working in customer service, because I do get it. Go somewhere else where the staff operates in a more professional manner, and creates an overall welcoming experience. Corporate,  please don't reach out to me, j have an extremely sour taste in my mouth from this whole dining experience."
10/29/2019,4,"Been coming to Bento for a while now and the consistency has been on point. I don't stray too much so I typically get the bento box with the Pao Pai spicy cream chicken(extra crispy). The chicken is really tasty and the sauce is just the right amount. The bento box comes with rice, noodles and a salad all for $10.50 which is a solid deal IMO.  They also sell desserts but as a little bonus, the bento box has some sugary cinnamon chips which does the job for me. Even though it's a chain restaurant, it doesn't take like one and I suggest you try it if you have not."
10/18/2020,4,"This is for the Davie location...the food is still good. I got the sushi combo it comes with 8 pieces of California rolls and 4 pieces of 2 of their classic sushi. I got rainbow and the caleninte rolls. The caleninte roll was the best but all the sushi was good over all. The sides is where it lacked, not so much in taste but only four tiny cucumber pieces for the kimchi and the salad had little to do dressing. Uts sad because both actually did taste good."
8/27/2019,4,"Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi is a great concept. It's good Asian food fast at affordable prices. They offer Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes. From General tso to red curry to rainbow roll & many more tasty Asian dishes all in one spot. Can't go wrong.This location is in a large popular/busy shopping center. Finding a parking spot during certain days/times can prove challenging. This Bento is big, bright, clean and has a simple modern Asian inspired decor. The staff is polite and helpful. You order at the counter and place the number you are given on your table. The food/boba beverage is brought to your table. They also have self serve fountains drinks next to the utensils and napkins. The chopsticks and soy sauce bottles are already on the table. Once you've done, a staff member will come by and clear the table. Three out of four times I visited so far have been good/solid. The other time could've been better. But all in all like the concept, food, ambiance and affordable prices."
10/1/2020,3,"I'm familiar with Bento back in Gainesville where it originated from but I'm not really a fan... I get the slight appeal since it seems like busy college students can get their quick Asian food fix at a somewhat reasonable price but I think it could better. For the price, I think the quality is low and portions are small. I've tried their sushi rolls, bowls, bento boxes, udon noodle and if I HAD to choose, I would say the bowls are probably the most worth. I think there are better Asian restaurants in the area but if you want a really quick fix for your craving and willing to spend at least $10 for your meal then I guess you could come here."
3/25/2022,5,AmZing and delicious food ! Crunchy veggies and juicy chicken :) and mickayla was so helpful when choosing the right bowl! I ordered the stir fry chicken and she was right ... it was the bomb:) will come back asap
8/15/2019,5,"This was my go to lunch spot every week when I worked closer to this Davie, FL location. Now that I'm further away, I hope they open one either closer to my new job or close to my house. I sometimes take the trip on the weekend to satisfy my Bento cravings. They are located in Davie, right off of University Drive in the Home Depot Plaza just south of I595, very busy and conveniently located spot. They get super busy at lunchtime so I recommend getting there no later than 11:45AM - 12PM. Although the line can be long at times, it moves very fast.The atmosphere is hip and eye catching. I love the ambiance and feel of this spot every time I'm here. Parking can be tricky if you don't arrive by 11:30AM - 11:45AM. Since they are in a plaza with so many other business's, there is additional parking all over so you will find something. The Food! This is why this place is so popular. The food is so good and they offer a big variety of dishes. They have everything from sushi to signature bowls to build your own poke bowl which is what I always get. I usually order the Build Your Own because I like selecting everything that goes in it. They also offer Boba Tea's. I get the Boba mango with mango jellies...YUM! They have a kids menu as well which is great. This place is a must."
8/2/2020,4,"Bento has saved the day (or night) when everyone was closing early due to Covid. Their food is piping hot and flavorful. I love the Mt. Fuji sushi.  Visually appealing and tastefully pleasing!! Although they're not having dine in at the moment,  the take out was so worth it! Friendly staff and food came out in less than 10 minutes.  Ive been to this location a few times and thought I wrote a review but I guess I didn't!"
6/16/2019,5,"I've been a huge fan of Bento for years and I was so glad when it moved down to south Florida! This has a great atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food. On this visit we luckily had no wait to order although it seemed the dining area was relatively busy. Our food was delivered to our table in no joke 5 minutes! I can't believe how fast it was! Maybe it was just our lucky day.I get the same thing most time that I come, I love the sweet and sour chicken with a mango boba on the side. On occasion I will order the bento box which never disappoints. They have good sushi too. In the past I have made a telephone order for to-go a couple times and never had a bad experience with that either. If you haven't been, you need to give it a try!"
9/11/2022,1,"This place used to be excellent. Now they serve very little, the soda machine is filthy, the beverages taste like tap water, the staff is rude, and the cashier doesn't know menu items. On top of that, they tip themselves auto adding a 15% tip to for bad service and don't tell you about this when paying. I looked at my receipt after paying and would have tipped twice had I selected add tip option. The total they tell you is not what you pay. This is likely why they have a sign that reads cards accepted only. I mean, what business doesnt accept cash?? I wanted to tip cash directly to the server. The screen asked for a second tip and only shows you the pre-tip total. This goes for anyone, and is not based on the size of your party. The salad had no dressing and was just lettuce, the California rolls looked old and dried out. Wish I'd read Yelp first.  Never again, going to the poke place next time."
3/20/2021,3,"The first time I visited this restaurant was on a slow day in the middle of the week. Everything went smoothly and the food was good.The second time the experience was much different. My poke bowl came out quickly but I also ordered 4 piece sushi and my boyfriend ordered a full sushi roll. After about 20 minutes of waiting at our table, watching people that came in after us get food before us, someone approached our table and asked if we had gotten the full sushi roll we were waiting on. We told them no and reminded the person about the smaller sushi order. My boyfriend's order then came out about 5 minutes afterward, packaged in a to-go container even though we were eating in. No big deal about the container but there was still more of a wait for the rest of the order to come out. When the 4 pieces of sushi finally came out the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was dark gray. I also had tuna in my poke bowl which was fresh and bright pink so clearly the roll I just waited nearly 40 minutes for was not fresh. I was excited to return after my first visit but I would really have to be in the mood for this and in the immediate area to visit again."
4/10/2021,5,This place is so yummy and decently priced if you don't try everything on the menu. Ha ha
7/23/2020,4,"My favorite thing about Bento is the fact that it's very customizable. If you are getting a bowl then you can choose a base (lo-mein, udon noodles, or rice), an entree (red curry, kung pao, sriracha garlic, etc.), and then a meat (or tofu for vegetarians!). My go-to dish is always the red curry with udon noodles and tofu. I do love Bento but unfortunatley I do think their food lacks authenticity. If you are looking for a truly authentic dish, then this is not the place to go. But if you love asian cuisine, I'd definitely give this place a try! The menu is extensive and truthfully overwhelming if it's your first time but I love that that there are so many options on the menu. I'd recommend taking a look at the menu before going to Bento. Some of the items on the menu besides the customizable entree bowls are poke bowls, sushi, and bento boxes. I'm not a fan of their boba teas. I've tried multiple and the boba itself is always too hard and very chewy. The milk teas themselves also don't taste fresh (I'm assuming powders are being used?).Additionally, during lunch/dinner time the lines are HUGE and it takes about 10-15 for takeout to come out. So I usually call ahead, place my order, and it's ready to go in about 15 minutes! It definitely very convenient and always dependable."
1/17/2022,5,"I've been here years ago, and I loved it.Today I called to cancel my order I did though the website to order on Uber eats ( lazy Monday vibes lol ) when I call, they were nice and helpful with canceling my order. Did my order though Uber eats and can't wait to get my delicious food from this location and place.I highly recommend them :)"
4/17/2021,5,First time there and was pleasantly surprised. Went for teriyaki Tuesday and was super tasty. Also 2x1 boba teas! Definitely will return
3/15/2019,4,"I love bento for a quick sushi/poke fix. I haven't had the pleasure of trying their hot kitchen- I take that back. Because for a super secret cheat meal when I'm in the YOLO feels I'll get the spicy cream which fried battered chicken bites, drenched it spicy mayo on top of a rice bowl with either red/green peppers. soooooo goood. Anywhoo, I get the spicy don with either salmon, or tuna, or you can get half and half. It comes with wakame seaweed salad, avocado, cucumber, and you should ask for some eel sauce. Sooo yummy! The sushi there aren't like specialty rolls, but they're fulfilling. This place is a quick fix. A lot of people affiliated with Nova are always here."
3/20/2022,4,"I enjoy Bento, it's great for quick takeout. I love ordering the bentos for variety and it's all really good. I sometimes also go in for a boba milk tea. Last time I got taro and it didn't really taste like taro. However my kids didn't love their Orange chicken. They did like the stir fry noodles and fried rice though."
3/1/2019,4,Came by for a quick bite with the family and the place was packed and hopping so these guys must be doing something right lol!When you enter there are menus from which you cN choose your meat and a Poke Bowl with Rice or Noodles or a Bento Box.  You then pay and sit down and as soon as your meal is ready the server will bring your meal to the table.We all ordered our individual meals and it was fresh and tasty.  A dinner for 4 with 1 appetizer and 2 ice teas and 2 iced coffees came to $88 with the tip!We will definitely be back when in the area specially as my son owns the Insurance Agency across the street from here lol!
1/30/2020,4,"I LOVE Bento! They use to only have one in Gainesville and now we have one here in Sofl, for the last couple years. I always try to stop in when I'm in the tower shops. This place is a fast casual Asian eatery. Their build your own style is something I love as I am a picky eater. Very reasonable prices and the food isn't fancy but downright delish. Think Chipotle but Asian cuisine. Try their Pao Pao chicken if you like spicy and creamy. Their Udon Pork soup is fantastic. Also Poke and Bento boxes. You really can't go wrong here. The only downside for me is that the staff seems to have a somewhat high turn over, so the service can be hit or miss. Sometimes my food is out right away and other times it takes a hot minute just get a Boba Tea.As long as the food quality stays on point I will keep coming back :)"
12/8/2018,4,"Bento holds a place close to my heart, it gives me all of my fondest college memories! This was actually my first time at the South Florida location so my expectations were pretty high. I got one of my two usuals- a build a Poke bowl. To my surprise, they gave the option of a mini- one protein in your bowl. This was the perfect size for me because I hate taking home raw fish if I can't finish it. I had salmon as my protein. Wakame (seaweed salad), cream cheese, & tempura flakes as my toppings. The tempura flakes were different from what I was used to. They resembled rice crispies & actually kind of tasted like it (ew.) The amount of toppings and extras also depends upon the size you get- mini, regular, or large. The service was pretty good & the food came out very quick! This place is pretty far from where I live but I'd come back if I was in the area. Rumor has it, there's a location opening up in Pines (yay!) Guess we'll have to wait & see!"
3/10/2020,5,"We love this location so much, we drive nearly an hour to get there. Yes it may seem crazy just for sushi, but, no other location in Miami matches the quality of their sushi for the lower cost. Not only is their food good but it's in a great plaza that you can also go shopping after you eat. They also have a lot of tables inside the establishment, so a large group shouldn't be a problem. We can't speak on the other dishes they serve since we haven't had them yet, but their sushi is a no brainer. There was only roll that we didn't like since it was a plain roll. Although it didn't taste like anything special, some soy sauce and spicy mayo fixed the issue. We have recommended this location to friends and recommend it to other people to try as well."
9/30/2021,3,"Update- 10/19/21: Bento has reached out and I have shared my concerns via email. They seem to be committed to improving and to providing a excellent customer service. For this, I have decided to change my star rating from 2 to 3. This may improve should I have several positive experiences with the food quality in my return visits.I want to like this place. We eat here nearly every other week and are constantly disappointed with the quality control of the food and service. Every other time we order there is a different problem. The Udon soup is a favorite. It's supposed to come with Bok Choy and every other time we order it, the Bok choy is missing. LOVE the flavor and noodles but they constantly miss ingredients. Don't even get me started with Uber eats orders (whole meals not in the bag). The sushi pretty awful constantly. I don't even think they make it with raw fish anymore. The service is so sporadic. We often finish one meal in a group before the others are dropped. Or we wait and it gets cold. If the food was consistent and quality I wouldn't be making this review. You might ask ""why do you still go there?"". Well because the price is right and when it's good, it's really good. Just disappoints more times than it should. Also, an observation, there seems to be no full adult supervision in this place. Where is the management?! Is this place really ran by teenagers."
11/18/2018,3,"This is my third time patronizing this establishment this year. I finally decided to write a review since I've got a taste of a variety of different items. Well let's be honest I've only had three different Poke bowls and some crab rangoons but I can talk about those and my overall experience.The most recent Pokeball I decided to go with was fried tofu and poke salmon. I did not like the fried tofu. If you notice in my photo, it was fried to the point where it was shriveled up and dry. It was quite uneventful. Tofu already doesn't have any flavor so fried in such a way made it a bit more difficult for my palate to enjoy. The combination of the mango ,the edamame, and the wakame made for good toppings. They did forget my scallions and sesame seeds but whatever. I was not about to leave my library time to go back for these items. I give this place a 3 out of 5 because it's not the greatest but it's also not the worst. You kind of get what you pay for. I also wasn't impressed with the steamed shrimp I had in another bowl. The shrimp were sliced so thin and considering it cost more and they give you less, I was disappointed. Overall, this place is good for quick bites. I've never sat down at the establishment so I can't comment on the service. It seems as though at least everyone working the registers to take your orders are very knowledgeable and super helpful. They don't rush you and considering they have so many options on the menu, it can take a while for someone to order. I appreciate that they give you the time to do that."
11/3/2021,5,"Love stopping at Bento while I am out shopping in the plaza! The food is always DELICIOUS! Love the atmosphere and the quick service. Definitely recommend if you're in the area. A great, quick, quality sushi stop."
12/3/2019,5,"Bento essentially takes all the building blocks from the noodle bowls, bento boxes and sushi, offering them in a mix-and-match format over white rice, brown rice or mixed greens, with a phalanx of zippy sauces and a nice array of crunchy toppings (nice to see togarashi and furikake, both seasoning blends that add vim to anything). There are plenty of appealing protein options here, from spicy tofu to katsu-style fried chicken, and a small handful of signature bowls with well-conceived assemblies of ingredients. The Bento location is bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows, contemporary light fixtures and chairs that hint at midcentury modern classics. The order counter is a study in red lacquer with a dramatic black side wall that is festooned with Katakana and Hiragana characters (or maybe they're just cool squiggles;not sure). It's an appealing and pleasant space, but with lots of people loitering and waiting for their to-go order, it doesn't feel like a place you'd camp out for long.I found solid offerings in nearly every category on the menu. Solid, but nothing that scaled new heights or brought the unexpected. If I have one overall criticism, it's that dishes have too much sauce, sauces that were frequently a little too sweet. A Szechuan chicken bento box ($10) made me wish for more restraint on the deep brick-colored sauce so the snow peas, broccoli and white-meat planks had more room to shine. The rest of the sectioned bento contained the classic iceberg salad with the ginger dressing, a dome of white rice, a tangle of soy-bronzed lo mein, short lengths of nicely done fried Szechuan green beans and a passel of fried wonton skin triangles drizzled with a sweet sauce. A fair amount of food for $10, and good variations of flavor and texture, but nothing knocked my socks off."
10/6/2018,4,"My cousins husband told us about Bento Cafe. They have a very busy and fast paced lifestyle with work and their kids school/extra curricular activities. Most days, they are on the go for dinner or lunch, and they frequent Bento a lot. We tried to go one evening with the kids, and the line was completely out of the door. It was a bit overwhelming. On one hand, you are thinking ""Wow! It must be really good!"" and then ""do I really want to wait in this line?""We were starving and decided to order our food to go. They don't have an app for online ordering so you either have to order in the to go line or call the order in. The first meal we had with the restaurant gave me mixed feelings. I ordered a poke bowl and when we got home and I started eating I found a black hair in my mango which is an epic fail. Besides that, the taste of the food was really good. My husband didn't really get enough time to look at the menu so after seeing my meal wished he had ordered a poke bowl as well. He said it was good, but it wasn't enough food for him. I don't remember what he got, but there was shrimp, veggies, and rice. The bowl was small. The kids got orange chicken and chicken teriyaki. Overall, the meals were pretty good for them, but in the future we would maybe find something they agreed on and order a larger portion. With how much my family frequents this place and the taste outside of my finding, I decided to try the establishment again because things happen. The downside of it for me was I was already home, and there wasn't much we could do about it. My husband and I went back again. This time we both ordered the large poke bowls. The poke soy tuna isn't anything like the poke I had in Hawaii so if that is what you are expecting... don't. You'd come closer to the taste in Hawaii getting the spicy tuna. That is my favorite for the bowl. I really love the wontons as an option, because then I was able to make little tuna wontons towers with wakame and jalapeno. We were both very pleased with the second visit. The large poke bowls come with a nice amount of food, everything is fresh and tasty, and I love the options you get to choose from. You could come up with all kinds of creations and never get bored. Bento is always crazy busy with the line to the door which says a lot about their product. I am glad I gave it another try because it really is delicious. Helpful hint: Have workers wear hair nets??"
10/2/2018,3,I stopped into Bento today and I ordered a Vietnamese Pork dish & the Sushi Combo box. The sushi here is tasty. The Vietnamese Pork dish left a lot to be desired.Another thing I noticed about this dish is in a photo that was a couple years ago the pork looked very different. It had grill marks and looked very juicy. The pork I got looked roasted in an oven or made on a skillet. I much rather would've had what they used to make. I still chalk this place up as a place I'm willing to come back to and try more things.PS - This would've easily been a 5 star review if the Vietnamese dish was on point with robust flavor.
10/19/2019,3,"So I really like this spot because I have been coming here a number of times, but unfortunately I got food poisoning from something I had there a few nights ago. I tried the pork fried dumplings and it had such a strange taste I only ate one. After that, I ordered the Creamy spicy chicken bowl with lomein; the chicken was very good but again the sauce that the lomein was tossed in had a funny taste that I could only stomach 2 bites before giving up on it. Later that night I was sick to my stomach. It definitely had to be one of those food items I ate or both. Such a disappointment."
3/1/2022,1,"Sorry, so many things wrong with this place that I would write a book if I listed everything. Don't believe the fake reviews and don't try reaching out to me to try to change my mine. If management is clueless then you shouldn't be in business. Waste of time and money. With so many good asian and sushi places out there I have no reason to ever go back!"
9/25/2018,5,"When you need a quick bite and your craving sushi, rice bowls or noodle bowls this is definitely the place. It has an option for everyone. The prices are around 11$ depending on what you get. You walk up to the counter and order they give you a number and the employees bring the food to you. It's always clean. The employee who took my order was very patient with me, she also helped explain the sauces and items I wasnt familiar with. She was very helpful and even offered me a cup for water while I wait for my food to go. Which has never happened before at other restaurants/fast service , I was very grateful for her offer.My food came fast! I was very surprised faster than usual. They've changed up the menus and organized it better. I decided to make a sushi bowl and I picked the regular size which is a very good amount of food, very good for the price. They also have available a corner with to go boxes, chopsticks and napkins available. It can get busy during dinner time but honestly it's a great place if you have a family or friends because of the big variety of options to order. I will definitely be coming back soon. Hope they make more locations soon."
12/13/2020,5,Love this place Many asian options plus some beer/beverages Sushi is fresh! The curry rocks also fried rice (upcharge)  o___o Good music & vibe Our last visit wasn't so organized as our food came out before our sushi etc. but LONDON helped make it like we know it So we'll keep coming back!!
8/31/2021,1,Terrible service food can take up to 30 mins for something simple such as fried rice. I've had weird tasting food and complained. But when asked for a refund didn't want to refund me even though I the food tasted off. Another problem is a cashier was open and didn't take us because they were too busy drawing and didn't ask us if we were ready to order until we went to the next cash register. I have been coming to the location since it has opened but in the past year the restaurant service has gone down a lot.
8/28/2019,4,"Would recommend the poke bowls and sushi over the hot items. For the price and quality, you can't beat it. Plus they have a huge selection of foods, so it's great for groups! Casual place to go that won't break the bank for decent quality fish!"
3/26/2022,5,"Scrumtdileunchis , i was so good that I order at this place on a daily , THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE HAD IN A WHILE."
12/28/2018,5,"Whether you're into sushi or hot meals this place has something for everyone! You must try the milk tea! Stick with something simple like strawberry or mango flavor before venturing out to some of the other flavors. Be sure to pick up a punchcard for them because when you buy eight you get your ninth for free. They can also make a milk tea into a smoothie which is great on those really hot days. The food comes out quickly, and shows up as soon as it's ready, so it doesn't always come at the same time, but that also means it's nice and fresh when you get it. I have been to this location about 50 times and so far only had one instance when I ordered to go that it took a while.Parking can be a bit tricky at times. Tower Shops is not known for having readily available parking. I usually have to park at the end of Michael's and cross the grass area rather than sitting in front of the restaurant."
3/21/2018,4,Pretty good poke and sushi here. I've been a couple times and both times the food was good and came quickly. This time I got the Florida roll and the spicy yellowtail roll. Really great! It tasted fresh and had good flavor to them. I also decided to get some boba tea before I left and I'm so happy I did! I got the pineapple flavor green tea with strawberry boba. It was so refreshing and sooo tasty. I'd definitely like to make this a regular stop!
2/12/2022,2,Bento box: cold lo mein with undercooked chicken. Several times coming to this place and the last one today. Definitely I can't recommend.
9/10/2019,1,"Today I decided to go back to this location and try the pao pao shrimp udon bowl again. Again I had high expectations and AGAIN, I end up biting into shrimp tails!!! How the heck do you Leave the tails on a shrimp dish which is coated in sauce... can't even see the tails until they start grossly crunching in your teeth. What a huge disappointment. I thought my last review got the attention of someone from customer service & they even promised that they would send me a gift card. And made it seem like the shrimp should NOT have tails on them & as if I got unlucky the first time around. I guess this is the new norm. Yuuuuucccckkk. Never got the gift card. Same disappointing dish. I really used to love this place. My first review was 5 stars. UGH."
3/10/2022,4,This is such a good place but the manager here at night his name starts with a B is so rude!!!! Definitely suggest getting volcano roll !!!
2/6/2018,3,"I have been here twice and both times the lines were really long.  I thought that meant the food would be great, but in reality it is just okay.  The sushi is fresh and you can make your own combinations.  They have poke bowls and bubble tea as well.  Still, this is like a fast food chain joint.  It is generally loud and pretty packed, but the portions are good and the pricing is reasonable for sushi."
3/28/2018,4,"This is a gem in the tower shops plaza. A great place to go for lunch and dinner. Bento's has an inexpensive menu filled with variety.For 8-11$ you can get bowls, noodles, or even a bento box that has a little bit of everything with your entree. I get the spicy creamy sriracha chicken bento box. It is about 9.50 and it comes with a lot of food. A lot of good tasting food for a balanced meal. Along with the chicken, the box comes with green beans, ginger salad, rice, lo mein, and some small looking cereal things.I also got the chicken katsu rice bowl. It was fried too hard this time around, felt like it could be better. Definitely need sauce to eat it. In Orlando they charge you like 50 cents per sauce but here it's free. Eel sauce & yum yum are the go-to'sWill be back for either another bento box, sushi or a pokè bowl!"
5/17/2021,5,Bento always slays! It gets quite busy sometimes making a quick order take a while but it's worth the wait
12/8/2020,1,"Super disappointed. We first ordered at a Bento in Jacksonville and the delivery to our hotel was smooth and the food was awesome. So we were excited to see we could have the same at home with a little longer than usual drive.We gave it a try today and the food was a total let down. While the Jacksonville food had been fresh, plenty and delicious, this was the opposite.I ordered a regular ""create your own bento bowl""for pickup through seemless. I asked for half noodles and half salad as it was offered in the order. I only got salad. A tiny portion of the proteins and the avocado. And the wasabi topping was mixed in so that I thoroughly burned my mouth thinking I was biting into avocado. It looked like a carelessly thrown together side salad. Which left me completely hungry.My husband ordered the Pad thai and it looked completely different (with a red -ish sauce?) too and he said it was super hot (spicy) and not nearly as good as what we had in Jacksonville. Unfortunately a first and last kind of experience.Real bummer!"
10/15/2019,4,"Worth visiting. I went to Bento once for lunch with my co-workers and was impressed by several things. Lets get started. THE PLACE: locate din a shopping center, parking is a breeze. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and has a bit of a ""zen"" feeling to it. All was clean and many tables were available. THE FOOD: Its been a while since I went, so I cant really remember the name of my food, but I do remember enjoying it all, especially the ginger flavored salad!! Chai tea was also delicious. THE SERVICE: Service is very is quick- you make the line, place your order and the food is delivered to your table. Everyone whom I encountered was courteous and friendly."
9/12/2020,5,Food was great. The sauce for the krab wonton was delicious! Takeout was on time. Always enjoy bento no matter the location!
4/29/2021,1,I use to love coming here a few years ago so I was shocked at how downhill their quality of food has gotten when I ordered dinner from here last night. My husband's bento bowl barely had any sushi in it. They practically served him a bowl of sushi rice. My katsu meal was horrible. I couldn't eat it and the rice was overcooked. What a disappointment. I use to recommend this place to my friends all the time. I will go to Poke Ramen instead.
7/22/2018,5,"I love the sushi and sushi bowls at bento. I tried this place originally in Gainesville when I was in college and was so happy when they opened up in my own backyard. The menu selection is huge, both Chinese and Japanese dishes to choose from. My personal favorite is the create your own sushi bowl. It's basically like a sushi roll of your choice in a bowl: I get the raw salmon, breaded chicken, mushrooms, avocado, edamame, masago, cream cheese and the crispy fried onions over white rice. It comes with two sauces of your choosing - I go with the spicy mayo and ponzu sauce. It's delicious, fresh, fast and cheap. I love the idea of fast food sushi, rather than the traditional unhealthy fast food places. This place is great!"
11/24/2017,3,"I found out Bento Cafe is a chain at here. Florida has at least 4 stores. This one located on the University Avenue was very busy. It is heaven for young people to spend money due to very affordable price on the food.  The interior was decorated very nicely. Why they are average. The tables were not clean often. Even they are clean, they did not do a good job. Food is just average in comparison to many Asian Fusion place. We got beef udon noodle, poke bowl, spicy tuna roll, Florida roll and lavender jelly drink. The noodle and poke is build your own. Basically if you did not get your sauce right,it is on you. The food is average due to their selection to added on is limited by the the ingredients they have and number of items you can added into your bowl. The sushi rolls are not up to the standard. The best we have order just the lavender boba slush. This is the only memorable item."
7/8/2018,4,"Really great first experience at Bento! I ordered a milk tea smoothie that was pretty good; the only place in the area where milk tea smoothie is even an option! Boba was good consistency, although flavor was a bit watery. The sushi was great as well, and I loved that you can build your own box. Only downside to my experience was the more than average amount of gnats in the restaurant. Otherwise, good food!"
10/10/2017,5,"After hearing all the hype from my girlfriend about how this place was amazing when she was in Gainesville, we decided to try this place out, which we did this last Sunday after our Japanese classes at Morikami.Located in the Tower Shops shopping complex in Davie, Bento Cafe is a quick service restaurant. Upon walking in, you look at the menu which is placed at the entrance. The concept is that you order one of the many entrees at the menu (and there are many to choose from) and then you choose whether you want a rice bowl, noodle box or bento box. As this place is known for its bento boxes, I went with a bento box. This menu is extensive in that you can also make your own poke bowl and sushi rolls. I ordered the chicken sriracha garlic bento box and my girlfriend had the szechuan chicken bento box. Once our orders were placed, we sat down and awaited our food. As I ordered a miso soup ahead, that came out first. The miso soup was very brothy and was a very good beginning to the meal.Soon afterwards we received our bento boxes. I have had bento boxes in the past that contained 2-4 items. These boxes come with the entree, your choice of white or brown rice, lo mein, ginger salad and string beans with some pieces of fried wontons. I was wowed by the size of the boxes and wondered if I would be able to finish this box. Surprisingly, I was able to finish it all and loved it. The crunch and spiciness of the chicken sriracha mixed with all the other accompaniments was delicious and wowed me completely. Once finished, I was definitely full and satisfied. I could see why this restaurant gets so much hype; i think it's definitely worth it. Next time I may order a poke bowl, as now I have a hankering for one."
2/6/2022,2,"Don't go here if you're not expecting good take out. First time they lost my order. Second time no spicy mayo even though i paid for it, i want a refund because its dry with no sauce. Poor service"
9/26/2019,4,"I remember having Bento at least twice a month when I was in college in Gainesville. So excited that since then they have spread to a few more locations. We got the Spicy cream chicken (now called Pao Pao) brown rice bowl with veggies which was delicious and The Mongolian beef (plus shrimp) Bento box which was good but the ENTIRE thing was cold, it was very strange and the consensus on the noodles were that they tasted like mustard (which the tables on both sides of us agreed). My partner got the original milk tea with Boba and I got the taro milk tea smoothie with boba. Both were delicious and refreshing, loving the surprise of cold chewy boba in the drink. Besides cooked meals they have the options of sushi and Poke bowls which I look forward to coming back to try!"
11/30/2020,2,"Bento is a famous place with good taste But this one ‍ Our food was cold and the taste was bad too My friend got a side of veggies and I can tell that it wasn't fresh! It looks like if they just put the side of veggies in the microwave  The chicken was cold like undercooked.Oh, and I have to wait longer because my meal wasn't ready but they brought my friend's bowl first . Hopefully, they can improve their kitchen and service as well."
11/28/2017,4,"Had a poke craving and so glad I found this japanese asian fusion joint.Line was long and to the door, but moved fairly quickly. It's self serve.The menu is VAST with lots of choices which can be intimidating, but they were smart to have menus right at the back of the line, so you can go back and forth between what you want while you wait :)Got the poke bowl with 3 proteins (max). A good number of toppings, sauces. brown or white rice. Loved my poke bowl.Also tried family's chicken lo mein noodle bowl and tofu bento. Tofu and chicken was excellent as well. OVERALL: would come back."
7/2/2021,2,"I was undecided between 2 1/2 stars and 3. It wasn't nice. The brown rice was lumpy and pudding, the szechuan sauce was mediocre at best. I ordered it with beef and shrimp, beef was over cooked. It wasn't worth the $18 price tag with a small bottle of water. I make better Asian at home."
11/4/2017,3,"After running some errands in the tower shops my 7 yr old and I decided to grab lunch at Bento. For this trip, my daughter who loves rice opted for the chicken fried rice instead of the kid's bento box.    She got it with no onion or scallion and she said it was good. I got the make your own vegetable roll. I chose cucumber, avocado, mushroom and red onion.  I could barely see the avocado except in the last piece. It was okay. Nothing special. I had the stir fry veggies over brown rice. Not bad. It came out super fast as if it was all already ready. The rice was lukewarm. Last trip I had the fried avocado roll, it was okay.  More rice than avocado.  I did enjoy the noodles with veggies. The boba tea I had was too sweet. Both visits I felt rushed in ordering.  This trip I felt like the cashier was annoyed I wasn't ordering quick enough. The people next to us asked the floor person for napkins and she seemed annoyed she needed to fill them in. I had tried to ask her for a Togo box and she completely ignored me. The gentleman next to me asked her for me and she just pointed ""they are over there.""  I didn't see them because they blended in and considering I was at the table with my 7y old, it wouldn't have killed her to grab it for me. All in all, the food is okay. I haven't been impressed with service. Everything comes out as it is ready.  Will probably go back if I am in the tower shops, but wouldn't make a huge effort to do so."
6/24/2021,3,"Been there twice in the last year, and twice they were late opening because something was broken. Then they were out of 3 of the 4 things I ordered. Pad Thai was great, but...."
3/30/2018,5,"Great service and even better food. $15 is a bit pricey for the portion size but it's very friendly so it equals out. The environment is calm and a great place to enjoy friends. I ordered the Garlic Broccoli Shrimp Noodle Bowl with a Green Tea, Lychee Boba drink and I must say, I'm impressed with my choices. I'm extremely satisfied."
8/4/2021,3,"Like the food but the waiting is awful,. sitting in the table for my meal for 35 minutes ,. Looks like to go is first"
6/15/2020,4,Bento is popular around the tower shops and I can see why. I personally like the poke bowls and I'll usually get an unsweetened green tea. I actually liked the green tea so much that I now but it in bulk on Amazon. The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's usually always busy. I go here occasionally when I feel like having sushi. Also a very clean looking place. Oh and their boba tea is great too!
1/9/2022,2,"the workers were very nice and gave good recommendations when i asked what kind of chicken to order. although too many different recommendations was overwhelming. i place a takeout order and the food took VERY long to come out. I asked for no peppers in my noodle bowl, yet i still got an assortment of different colored peppers. my stomach was very upset after this meal as was i. their food could use more flavor. i do not think i will be coming back to bento however if i do hopefully next time will be better"
4/5/2019,5,"I used to go to Bento at least once a week in college, so when I heard that a Davie location was opening up, I was over joyed! Since it opened, this location has never disappointed! From the sushi to the hot meals, everything tastes just as good as it did in college, and their menu allows for a wide range of options, so you can always try something new! I often get sushi from Bento, and it's always fresh and affordable! I especially enjoy their Signature roll Red Dragon and the Classic roll Special Mexican! On the kitchen side, I always get the Szechuan Chicken Noodle Bowl with udon noodles and it is spicy and flavorful and never lets me down! I've also had the Mongolian and the Sweet and Sour, and both of those have a great flavor as well! Bento is the perfect asian fusion restaurant, and its wide variety of sushi, poke, and kitchen entrees enables everyone to find something they love!"
7/10/2021,3,The sushi was better than the regular Asian food. So I will stay away from that all dishes but sushi was good and have a good variety
7/26/2019,4,"One-stop shop for a fast, straightforward Asian meal.  The menu is a simple breakdown of entrees that are served as rice bowls, noodle bowls, and bento boxes ; along with options for poke and sushi.  There is a good mix of meat and vegetarian options (tofu based) as well - something for everyone!  The bento boxes had pretty standard sides, including salad with ginger sauce, lo mien noodles, rice, cooked vegetables, and this ""dessert"" consisting of an interesting combo of fried wonton and condensed milk.  The stir fry entree with tofu was good, with soy sauce-based flavor. You order at the counter, get a number, and seat yourself. Service is fast, staff is friendly, seating is numerous and spacious. Overall a good stop for a casual lunch/dinner!"
10/12/2020,1,"Let me start off by saying when I ordered from this place the first time I was blown away from how amazing their food was.But the past two times I've been there was a total disappointment. Any time this place is busy in the evening/ night the quality goes way down. It's expensive to eat here. It's a ""treat yourself"" type of restaurant when you get paid. But honestly, after the two times I went there and my $63.00 order was old, cold and inedible, I can't see myself going back. Not sure if I should just try another location or find another spot for Japanese style cuisine."
3/11/2020,4,"I've been craving  sushi and I enjoyed the veggie sushi which has avocado, carrot, asparagus,cucumber, scallion and cream cheese. I also ordered the fried avocado roll . The avocado roll is so popular sometimes they run out lol. Instead I ordered the chicken tempura roll which is good option too. One of the new item on the menu is their $4.00 chilled sesame noodles ! It is so delicious ! The sesame soy dressing And crispy carrot and zucchini strips makes it a good combo. oh man it's really good. They should have a small medium and large option because it really tastes good! As a side, I really like the  veggie spring rolls in chili sauce. I also enjoyed the Thai tea. They also have bubble tea options with many different flavors. This place I know gets busy, but it's pretty spacious. I know you have the option of delivery with door dash which I have done.  If in the area it's a good food spot. Parking around may sometimes be a hit or miss but there's plenty of parking all around."
12/30/2021,1,Ordered few items and one was missing. When called the restaurant about it instead of apologizing or showing some empathy their attitude is I must take that up with doordash for a refund. Wtf I was even willing to go there and pick it up cause now one person doesn't get dinner! Defeating the purpose of having paid more for using doordash. I would've rather returned everything for a full refund when I went out to get more food.  Management failure!
8/10/2019,5,"Cool place with great food! You go up and put your order in and then pick a table to sit at, so kind of like a fast food restaurant but this food definitely does not taste like that. I got the Wok Fried Rice with tofu - delicious! My friend thought it was a little plain spice-wise but that was perfect for me. My friend got their choose your own bowl and chose chow mein with sweet and sour tofu. She liked it - the only thing was the soy sauce was a little heavy on the noodles, but it was overall very tasty. While I loved the food, I discovered I wasn't a huge fan of the milk tea smoothie. The milk tea gave it an odd sweet aftertaste, but I'm glad I got to try something new anyway. Overall, delicious!"
4/21/2017,5,"If you went to the University of Florida, then Bento Cafe needs no introduction.A staple in the city of Gainesville, this lovely chain saved many students back in the day. Cough cough - myself included, but I know there are others who feel the same given the reviews for this location. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I heard that they expanded in South Florida. Admittedly I wish they had chosen Miami for its first location down here, given that this is over half an hour drive from me, but I will make due. I am only grateful that the closest location no longer is in Orlando, or worse still, heading up a bit more north to Gainesville and having to deal with the obnoxious lines.That being said, let's focus on this new star, because yes, my lovelies, this is what this place is. A STAR! The ambiance is modern, and to those who know Bento Cafe, be ready to be surprised. There is light, bright light, not the dark and dim so known to the locations in Gainesville. Thank goodness, too; this brings an air of liveliness to the place. Oh, and they have some canopy-looking things hanging from the ceiling, which are pretty cool, all the while still maintaining its roots and having some red all around, reminiscent of the location on Archer Road in Gainesville.Décor aside, my roommate and I headed up to Davie to eat dinner yesterday. It was about time, too. This need to go visit this location has been going strong for nearly a year now, and well, let me tell you that the food did not disappoint. We ordered two miso soups, a ginger salad, a sweet and sour chicken udon noodle bowl, a Szechuan chicken lo mein bowl, and two Boba teas. I don't think I have to tell you all that we ate like piggies.To start off with, I had a ginger salad. My first ever at any Bento by the way. It was fresh and it opened up my palette. After this, I had my miso soup; my roommate had his, too, and although I loved mine, he wanted more mushrooms in his. He then went on to eat his sweet and sour chicken udon noodle bowl, which he devoured, but I must agree with him. While good, it could have been great. Why? The sauce seemed a tad underwhelming; you could barely taste it.My dish, on the other hand, was amazing. It was also massive given all my appetizers. I now have leftovers for lunch and I am looking forward to enjoying them. As for the Boba teas, my roommate had a Thai one with pearls, while I had a strawberry blended ice one with strawberry boba. I must confess that this is my first one ever from Bento, and well, where have I been living? Under a rock?Something to note, however. These teas are very flavorful and thus may feel heavy. I ordered a regular-sized Boba tea and I couldn't finish it. I think they need Oompa-Loompa size ones for children like me, or perhaps better said, for people who cannot drink so much in one sitting. Current sizes available: regular and large; there is no small. Bring a small, people, pretty please.Eek, thinking about all this now makes me see that while this location is a blessing, it may also be a curse. Is there such a thing as too much love? Because if yes, I'm definitely feeling it towards Bento, and well, I see myself having to feel it with LA Fitness. Oh, the problems of being a foodie."
12/27/2021,1,Overpriced mall food. Worst beef I've ever had and Fried rice taste burnt. I would not recommend & will not be returning
5/5/2017,5,"I've been wanting to try out Bento in South Florida as I ate Bento for 4 years throughout my college career in Gainesville where they originated. To my surprise, this place is huge (yes, much bigger than any of the locations in Gainesville) and so well decorated! I was so use to a wait in Gainesville but this location holds plenty of tables and customers. I can say this Davie location is well lit and aesthetically pleasing.Due to it being a Saturday night I visited, they were very busy. Couldn't find any parking near the restaurant so I circled around and ended up parking further. They have a line set up that wraps around the entrance for longer waits. Standing in line, I realized it was moving very fast. Faster than I could get my order together. They had two cashiers taking orders. Once your order is taken, you are assigned a number, and foodrunners will deliver it to your table.Bento is known for their speed and affordability. Our food hit the table probably within 5-10 minutes of sitting down. Their foodrunners are also very kind. They will bring you sauces or anything else you need.As for their dishes, they all have incredible flavor. I've tried almost everything on the menu but for this location, I ordered the Stir Fry Udon Noodles, Bento Fried Rice, and nigiri sushi pieces. Sushi for $2 a piece!! Unheard of. You have to order two of the same to get that price so $4 but I've never had cheaper. The stir fry udon noodles were amazing but if you don't like the strong taste of ginger, you should ask them to leave it out. It ruins each bite. My son loved the bento fried rice. We still had plenty of leftovers to take home as the portions ran large.I am definitely a fan of this location and would like to come back soon!"
6/7/2019,4,Returned again today to bento. One of the fave spots in town with really decent Asian style     Today service was super fast We ordered a Poke Bowl and two sushi's Tex Mex and Volcano yum yum!!!!!Perfect place to grab a bite no matter the size of the party
4/11/2020,1,"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!  Maria, the manger was absolutely  rude and liid to me when we went to pick up our to go order.  They had no wild greens to build a poke and said they called me to let me know, BS no calls on my phone.  It's Passover and can't have  rice or noodles.  Waiting 30+ minutes  for this.  UGH!!!AND their website said that everything we ordered was out of stock, whereas by phone it was fine.  First and LAST experience at BENTO!!!  NO stars!!!"
2/25/2017,5,"I always feel like I just give away 5 star reviews, but honestly it comes down to the quality of the food, the service and the price it costs. This place checked off each of those boxes. I'm sad there isn't one closer to me, but I can definitely say it's worth the drive. This concept I've been seeing a lot these days. Customizable rice bowls. Except this place doesn't charge extra for things like sauce and brown rice instead of white. Two of us did a build your own poké bowl. I was SO IMPRESSED! It's white rice, brown rice or mixed greens. Then you can choose up to 3 proteins and 4 mix ins. I was so indecisive because I'm used to being limited to 1 or 2 things. So bravo to this concept!! My friend customized her own bowl and my boyfriend got a sesame chicken bowl and a sushi roll. They both loved their meals. We also go steamed garlic edamame (GENIUS).The service was perfect. You order your food and then sit down and wait. But they are really good about coming around and checking if everything is okay or if you need anything else. We asked for some more sauces and they freely gave them to us. It's not close by, but I'll definitely find myself craving it and make the drive. Hopefully they expand further south in broward and into dade county."
5/16/2021,5,I ordered the crunch from the specialty menu and it was delicious. Juan the sushi chef not just brought it to me but also made a presentable tower.
10/23/2021,1,"I was dying of hunger so I stopped in. I ordered a chicken and shrimp wok fried rice. The rice was wet and mushy with too much soy sauce. You can literally taste the soy and the food lacks flavor. I also ordered a red curry shrimp, same thing no flavor full of sodium. No sure how this place stay busy cause it's not authentic Asian food. This is not a real Asian kitchen like it states. Not one Asian person in sight."
2/13/2019,5,"No where nearby comes close to the variety and quality of offerings at this Pan-Asian restaurant. Poke, along side pad thai, Szechuan style beef noodle soup, with the quality one would expect for each food item to be prepared in a restaurant catering to that specific cuisine. My colleagues and I love coming here for lunch. However, it's not a lunch to go to if you are going to be expected somewhere directly afterwards. First of all, the lines can get very long. Second, you'll probably be too full to concentrate."
5/17/2020,4,Love! Love! Love this place. This was the first bento to my knowledge in South Florida and before the opening at the Pembroke Pines location I would always go to this one. The food was always fresh and the staff made sure my meal was satisfying. I still go to this Bento when I'm in the area for old times sake but overall an amazing place for a sushi pick me up. There rice and noddle bowls are also very good. I would recommend the Spicy Cream or Sriracha Garlic rice bowls. I'm regards to rolls my ultimate favorite is the Florida Roll or Volcano roll.
1/29/2020,2,"The plates that we got were pretty decent in size but half of the plate was literally filled with rice. Me and my friend asked for triple side of avocado for each and we received not even half a small avocado. We had to ask for ""a side of avocado"" and it was like 4 small cubes. Besides that, the woman who brought us the plates started argued with us because I told her I ordered triple and avocado and ""it said double""The fish could have been better, I feel like it was not that fresh. My friend says that she has had better poke bowls before and we're sorry but we won't return."
12/31/2018,5,"This chain was opened in 2002 near the University of Florida and it soon became a student favorite. They have now expanded to 9 locations including this one in the Towers Shops in Davie. Parking is a bit of a pain but it's worth the hassle. The restaurant is nicely decorated with plenty of tables and a sushi bar at the end. You wait in line to place your order at the register and then they give you a number so they can find you to bring you your meal or take out order. The line was long but everything moved quickly. While I waited I checked out their menu. Choices include poke bowls, sushi, bento boxes, sides, soups, and bubble teas. I literally wanted to order $40 of food just for me but I had my choices narrowed down by the time I hit the register. My cashier was Narissa who was so sweet. Since it was my first time there I wanted to make sure I was going to like what I was ordering and she was so helpful. I decided on the chicken katsu in a bento box. Ckicken katsu is an Asian version of fried chicken. This one had a crispy sliced chicken breast covered in panko bread crumbs and served with a Japanese BBQ sauce. Bento boxes also include steamed white rice, crispy string beans, lo mein noodles, and ginger salad. I love a bento box. There is something so fun about all of those little compartments filled with delicious food. I always get one when I go to the Cornell Cafe at the Morikami Japanese museum in Delray Beach. Until now I had never found a local restaurant that served them. I also added a California roll and a tea to my order for $20. I wasn't sure what to order for a boba tea so I asked Narissa to pick her favorite. She chose for me a strawberry blended ice with popping strawberry boba. It was a sweet strawberry icy blend of heaven. When I sipped the straw the boba would hit my mouth and explode in more strawberry euphoria. The popping boba is 25 cent more. I loved my visit to Bento Asian Kitchen. I took my meal to go and once I got home all of the food I tried was great. The California roll was your standard roll but they gave a nice sized portion. The bento box was just like the ones I love at the museum and I can't wait to take my daughter to try one of the popping boba teas. This restaurant blows away another casual Asian restaurant in the same price point, Pei Wei. This restaurant has staff that is friendly and efficient unlike Pei Wei which is why I stopped going there. I just wish Bento Asian Kitchen was closer."
12/1/2016,5,"Ok, I'm fully a part of the Bento Cafe cult!! I've been dying to come here after seeing all the great reviews, but figured it wouldn't really happen anytime soon...but to my surprise, my dad said he would be at Costco and wanted to grab dinner here after!! Score!It was pretty busy when we arrived, but the line moved quickly, and it gave us time to study the menu til we reached a cashier.  They do a lot of ""Create Your Own"" things, so you should take some time to figure out how it works and what you want before getting to a cashier.  My dad went with a hot rice bowl - brown rice, sriracha garlic shrimp.  I tried a bite and was pretty impressed.  Nice size portion too, he barely finished it. I went with a create your own poke bowl - yes I should have gotten the greens as a base, but I was starving, so I did brown rice, tuna poke, salmon poke, fried tofu, avocado, wakame, cucumber, mushrooms with ponzu and spicy mayo!! Score! I LOVED it!It was pretty cold in here, so I ordered a miso soup as well, hoping it would come out first (it didnt) and an order of pork steamed dumplings, which also came out at the end.  The dipping sauce for the dumplings is more of a drizzle sauce (be warned) but these were great! I skipped a boba tea, and went with water instead, only to see they had a coke remix machine!! I think our check total was $28...which could have been cheaper if I didn't add on other things lol.  So, quite affordable.  Sure, it's probably not the best date night to order at the counter, but food is brought to your table, and the place was beautiful and clean.  I can't wait to come back! Question is, do I do a noodle soup? Do I make another poke bowl? Do I try their sushi! AHHHHH So yes.  Coke remix machine + affordable GOOD food, great atmosphere = 5 stars!"
4/9/2019,5,"Wow, I'm surprised i haven't reviewed this beloved place. My go-to spot for poke bowls and bento boxes. What I love most is that there is such a great variety, great for a big group..."
12/12/2018,4,"Always love coming to Bento Box! I originally had fallen in love with their bento boxes until I was introduced to the build your own Poke bowl.  The variations are endless and with the large you get such a good portion! I normally get two meats, tuna poke or spicy and imitation crab. For the additions I love pairing it with mango, avocados, edamame with cream cheese on the side. Toppings I do onions and tempura flakes with a side of poke soy sauce and spicy mayo! I wish they gave a little bit more for the portion price/size, I usually end up with a lot of rice left over. Needless, the flavors are great and always fresh! I also love their crab ragoons! Whatever sauce they use for the dip is phenomenal and usually end up putting some in my poke bowl! Highly recommended for a quick stop or sit down, I usually wait 5-10 mins max and togo is usually under 5 mins."
1/19/2020,3,"There's so much I need to  say about this place, so let's get started. It is located in a plaza with plenty of parking so it is very convenient. You do have to get in line to order which when we arrived had about 10 people ahead of us and we were ordering within 7 minutes so that was really nice. We ordered 2 sushi rolls and a red curry steak noodle bowl which cost us $40 so I found it a little more expensive than expected. Rolls were pretty amazing! So, why the 3 stars? Food came out rather quickly and we were with friends who also ordered more than 3 dishes so we were impressed with how fast food was made. However, we were missing a sushi roll. After 15 minutes I decided to approach the cashier and asked him for our roll. He went to check on it and they told him we already had it. Which we didn't. Then, the manager went to our table to ""verify"" we in fact did not have it. They didn't even apologize! They were just making sure  I didn't eat it and then went to get more, or at least that's how they made me feel and that is pretty unfortunate. After another 15 minutes, she came  back with it and said ""sorry, they don't know where it went"". All in all, great food but surely lacks that EXTRA customer satisfaction!"
12/30/2019,5,Loved it I have no complaints crispy tofu and yummy sriracha Garlic sauce I added vegetables and made a perfect Vegan Bowl!! I'm going to be there every week!!!!!! I can't wait to try more flavors.
11/2/2016,5,"10/29/2016 - LUNCHWhat a great concept! After looking at their extensive menu, at the line...which goes by pretty quickly, I decided to order the POKE BOWL.$9 one protein, $10 two proteins, $11 three proteins. The bottom of the bowl was between white or brown rice or greens, 4 sides and 2 sauces. I went with greens, on top the marinated spicy tuna, avocado, mango, edamame and peanuts, no sauce. You pay at the counter. They give you a number and you take a seat in the very spacious restaurant. Within 5 minutes or so, my food had arrived by a very friendly server. My friend ordered the Bento box, which was pretty large. I did get to try the green beans which were amazing. I am definitely coming back to Bento and ordering other items. Everything was fresh and plenty. You throw in a very customer friendly approach and you have a winner in my eyes!"
6/26/2017,5,"The food is awesome. Their poké bowls are so flavorful, and satisfying as well. The bento box is a good deal if you want to try a little bit of everything. I'd also recommend their kawaii rolls.Service usually very fast, and the staff is friendly. The place is kept neat and has a chill, fun vibe."
3/24/2019,4,It's a good way to have semi fast Japanese (?) food. Love the bento box. Has a nice assortment of items in one plate. Pretty quick but super busy!!
9/20/2018,3,"Bento helped me survive college at UF. It offered such a great array of Asian cuisines and became my comfort food shortly after opening. My orders were always simple. Beef Bulgogi Bento with extra spicy mayo OR Chirashi Don (with extra spicy mayo) AND a taro or almond milk tea with boba. When they started delivering, it was life changing, except delivery times were often REALLY LONG, so we just had to plan accordingly. So I was STOKED when I saw Bento had opened near my parents in Plantation and rushed to find out if it was the same great spot I knew and loved. Well, we couldn't get in to eat, so this review is based on their boba tea alone. We ordered two jasmine milk teas with boba. The jasmine was so strong it tasted like drinking perfume. The boba were kinda chalky in the center, as in undercooked. Definitely not delicately chewy like I'm used to in these drinks. So all told, these were bad. We reported it to the staff and they were quick to remedy the situation, whipping up two new Thai milk teas for us with fresh boba that were much better! I'm excited to get back home for a visit and eat here next time! I'm sure the rating will go up from there!"
1/10/2020,5,"I don't get to come here often, but when I do it is always consistently good food and service. I ordered the pad thai, which was extremely flavorful and a few rolls which were all good as well. Parking is always a little crowded since there are many businesses in the plaza, but they are not to blame. The seating is adequate for personal meetups and business chats as well. Glad they are opening a pembroke pines location near me, as I know i'd become a regular."
9/17/2016,5,"Been a fan since my early college days, visiting their locations in Gainesville and Orlando, and super happy they have finally opened one in South Florida!The thing I love about Bento Cafe -- options and customization! On the Asian Kitchen side of the menu, there are various hot meals you can order in forms of a rice bowl, a noodle bowl (lo mein, udon, or mini udon), or a bento box (yes, comes with other sides, pick this if you like more variety!). On the Sushi side, there are rolls and dons (donburi aka rice bowls) but there's the option to build your own too. I've never had the BYO option up north Bentos before so I like this new implementation, expanding your menu options to cater to your cravings. For the rice bowls, you can choose your own rice, 3 proteins, 4 toppings, and your sauces. Also, they have milk teas, green teas, and smoothies which are also customizable -- choose whether you want boba (large tapioca pearls), jellies, or popping boba). For those who really know me, I'm all about trying something new on the menu, but whenever I visited the Bento Cafes up north, I only had one craving: Spicy Cream. That is exactly what I got last Thursday night. Got the Spicy Cream shrimp on a bed of mini udon noodles. Comes with a side of garlic buttery green beans, which compliments the dish pretty well. Each flavor-packed bite brought nostalgia to my tastebuds, and despite how busy it was that evening, the wait from the long line was worth it! My honey got a Build Your Own poke bowl, which was super delish and fresh! They have A LOT of various options, even with proteins (not only just salmon and tuna but even poke versions and spicy versions, etc). By far the most extensive BYOB (build your own bowl) menu I've seen in SoFlo in regards to rice bowls and I am super excited to make my own bowl the next time I go back!For the teas, the honey got iced Thai tea and I got myself a honeydew milk tea boba with lychee jellies. I love their boba -- not too soft, not too chewy, just right!Great, fast service and super affordable. It was packed that night and it's only a soft opening on their very first week, so I'm glad Bento has a pretty good following. I'm also glad it's much closer now, because that means I can visit more often and try new dishes! OH, and I get the feeling this is the Red location because the decor was primarily red. Perhaps they'll open a Blue location soon? One can only hope! Heh, just a fan theory...Thanks for being a part of my college life, Bento Cafe, and I look forward to many more memories with you in present time with this new hot spot!"
5/1/2021,1,"The worst Bento I have ever been to. The wait times are outrageous for mediocre food. They have signs plastered everywhere saying they are ""understaffed"" yet there are at least 10 employees (not including in the kitchen) running around confused.  I ordered two bowls to go today, and my two friends eating in got their food first, and my food was still nowhere to be found 30 minutes later. I went up to ask, and they forgot about my order and just started making it when I asked. I get home and the bowl is about half filled what it normally is. Not only has the price increased on bowls, I waited nearly 45 minutes for a to go order in a not crowded restaurant, I got almost no food for 30 dollars. Save your money or order well in advance online."
10/13/2016,4,"Davie has suddenly become the nucleus for new restaurants.  The massive development of Tower Shops continues and Bento Cafe is the latest new tenant.  I really like the Chipolte-izing of fast casual restaurants.  This is a build your own type place for Asian cuisine.  Although you do not walk through an assembly line of ingredients like at Chipotle or Blaze, you do get to customize your order.  Being a fan of Poke from first trying it in Hawaii, I had to go for the Poke Bowl.  The options are truly endless, but I settled with Spicy Tuna & Spicy Salmon for my proteins and seaweed salad (wakame), dried seaweed (nori), and mango for my ingredients.  I had it on a salad instead of rice as I was trying to cut carbs.  For beverage I went with a large Taro flavored milk tea.The wait for the food was not long, the tea came out first and then the food shortly after.  The bowl was oh soooooo good!  I didn't like the salad underneath too much so maybe I'll try the rice.  You can also customize a ramen bowl which I am excited to try as well. The tea was as delicious as the ones at 545 Bahh Mi. I love me a good tapioca ball.  I've also had the Bento Box, I chose the Korean steak as the protein.  I found it to be a bit disappointing it was not spicy at all despite it being a spicy item on the menu.  Also I didn't like having noodles AND rice.  Once carb is probably enough.  The salad is eh and the sugar wonton desert sucks.  I would stick to the Poke bowls.Overall it was a great experience and I would come again.  My only advice would be to come earlier to beat the lunch rush as the line was pretty long when we  went."
10/19/2018,4,"Bento is my solid go-to in Davie for takeout or a quick lunch. They have customizable rice or noodle bowls, bento boxes, poke bowls, sushi, and lots of sides like edamame and veggie spring rolls. They also have a make-your-own boba tea which is pretty cool! The only things I don't love about Bento--They have freestyle coke machine, but no option for unsweetened iced tea which is my beverage of choice. -All the drink cups are one size. Fine for dining in when you can get a refill, but pretty small for the price if you're doing takeout. Their water cups are just as big or a little bigger than the cups you purchase for a drink. -There are up-charges for changing out veggies. For example, I usually get the orange chicken with snow peas and green beans instead of peppers, and there is $1 charge for each vegetable that I add even though I'm taking away the original vegetable it comes with. I wish substitutions were not extra because my $9 bowl can turn into a $13 bowl if I'm adding veggies and extra sauce. Other than that, I love Bento. The quality of the food is great for the price, the portions are perfect, and service has always been fast and friendly for me. Actually, surprisingly friendly staff for a counter service restaurant. Sometimes the lines are long, but they move quickly, and it's totally worth it!"
9/11/2016,5,"Bento Group expands to South Florida! The fresh fast food sushi and Asian fusion hot spot opens in the Trader Joe's shopping plaza near Nova, Tower Shops.You order food at the counter, from the hot food menu or the sushi menu. They have bento boxes, noodle and rice bowls, Poke bowls, sushi rolls and bowls... lots to choose from!I went with my usual favorite, the tuna + salmon don, which is a sushi bowl. They give a huge portion of sashimi and rice, and it's topped with avocado and spicy mayo. Bento also has a list of boba tea/smoothie/slush and flavors. I got the Jasmine milk tea with boba. I personally don't like flavor in my milk tea, but they offer taro, vanilla, Thai tea, and many other flavors. The boba is soft and sweet to taste.Service is fast and servers walk around tending to tables' needs, but the atmosphere is casual and self seating. Pro-tip: call ahead to pick up your order and skim the line!"
11/6/2018,4,"Fast food Asian fusion cafe.  A lot of tasty options here to choose from depending on what you are in the mood for.  There must have been 100 people in this restaurant and despite that, i must say that the service was pretty quick. Parking is a pain during lunch, so just go ahead and park across over by Office Depot area.I ordered the Bento Fried Rice and the portion was decent and food itself had lots of flavor. I think next time, i'm going with the Poke as everyone is telling me to try that next.I must say, the bathrooms were very clean and the soda fountain area was very neatly organized."
11/13/2018,5,Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi is one of my favorites spots to visit whenever I'm in the Davie area. If it means stopping in for some Lychee Green Tea Bubble Tea w Tapioca or actually sitting down to enjoy my meal then I'm there. My bf actually dislikes how much I enjoy this place but for some reason I'm always coming back. Bento is typically a line-out-the-door (we hope you know your order by the time you get to the register) kinda place. That has to tell you something about a place when it's constantly packed 25/8. You may feel deterred to come in and see quite a lengthy line but I promise they work through that line as quickly as possible. There's typically always 3-4 people working the cash register so don't worry about why 1-2 people are taking care of a line of 15+ people lol. (They have it covered)As I said I typically order a Sm Lychee Green Tea bubble tea with Tapioca and then a Florida Roll with (NO cream cheese) . This time that I visited I ordered:- Miso Soup- Lychee Green Tea bubble tea w Tapioca- Florida roll- Chicken Teriyaki BowlEverything came up to about $24 and the food got to the table almost minutes after we chose a spot and got drinks and utensils. I recommend anyone who wants a tasty lunch to visit!
9/27/2018,5,"I LOVE BENTOS!!! I swear I've been to several I mean several of sushi spots in both Orlando and Miami and I always come back to Bentos. Bentos is one of my favorite sushi spots. Gotta love them.My favorite rolls of all time are The Special Mexican and the Mount Fuji rolls. You have the option to order a half or full roll if you're feeling reall hungry. The prices are always reasonable too and the service is fast as well. I've  been to other fancy high end sushi places and nothing beats Bentos honestly, hands down. I definitely recommend this spot!"
8/21/2020,5,SO GASSSSSSSS this was my first time trying boba tea and It was love at first sight. The texture is amazing and the tea is delicious. The order came in fast too. The poke bowls r a rlly good size (mini in the photo) and they r fresh asf. My total was $12.86 which is SO GOOD for poke and boba tea. Every other place I've been to is overpriced. 173829201/10 this place has my heart
9/6/2021,1,Pictures are deceiving. I ordered the Mongolian beef bento box with white rice. $18 for 5 or 6 pieces of bland steak. I could have went to Pei Wei for almost half the price and got better flavor. Complete waste of money. Never again.
12/1/2019,4,"I've been a fan of Bento ever since college back at UF. I was so excited to see that they had a location in Davie. They are planning to open up a spot in Pembroke Pines near the Publix on Pines and Palm! My fave dish here is the Pao Pao Chicken (battered, fried chicken in sweet and sour + spicy mayo sauce). I like it in a bowl of rice or udon noodles or in the Bento box. Most things here are pretty satisfying depending on if you like savory versus sweet dishes. Service is decent and pretty fast."
10/28/2018,3,"Being in Bento 3 times.We got there around 9PM and ordered there was no lines!While I went to the bathroom the food was already out, they are super fast, but its the second time I come over that they forget an item we ordered!We asked for two ordes of the Rangoons, we got one and they forgot about the other one, 10 minutes later we stand up to go complain about it, and the girl who was bringing the food came over our table and asked if we were missing a order of the Rangoons and we said yes we are, 5 minutes later we got it!I ordered the Noodle Bowl, vegetable Stir Fry with chicken, was awesome their food is pretty good and no complaints about it! They just have to be a little more attentive on what you ordered, being there 3 times and they forgot a item in two different occasions!"
4/10/2019,5,"So yummy My mom and I were always eye-ing this place but each time the line was crazy, but today it was kind of slow so we went in. The menu isnt hard but you have a lot of choices and options. The cashier was so sweet and helpful, told her it was our first time so she explained some of the toppings to us. We got two mini poke bowls, my mom with tuna and mines with salmon they filled us up! Even the drinks are good, I hate washing my food down with soda and here you can get beer, rice wine, tea, and so much more. Also the cashier let me get my tea without boba, wooohoo!"
12/12/2018,2,"Very disappointing. I was in the area shopping and needed to get a quick lunch. I looked up Yelp reviews,  and this seemed like a good place to try. It's a medium sized clean location where the food is fresh and the customer service is great. The menu is huge - there are so many choices that as a first timer, it was a bit overwhelming.  You have to study the menu before you order unless you are familiar with it....which allows you to try new things each time. I decided on a shrimp tempura appetizer, and a  bento box with white rice and spicy bulgogi (all bento boxes come with ginger salad, lo mein, green beans and a small dessert of a few pieces of  fried won tons with a sweet sauce over it) . You get a number and sit down and a runner brings you your order when it's done . All of that should add up to a great experience.If only the food were as good. The shrimp tempura consisted of 4 ""big"" shrimp with dipping sauce for $7.99. Unfortunately there was  too much batter that made the shrimp seem big, and they tasted only like the oil they were fried in ( yuck - that needed to be changed). The dipping sauce was not the ""usual"" but seemed more vinegar than soy sauce base.I usually love spicy bulgogi, (spicy marinated beef, scallion and onion) $11.99,  but I did not like their version. It had a strange aftertaste - maybe hoisan sauce? Not sure but I did not care for it. The white rice was hot and good, but the lo mein was cold,  tasteless and dry. The green beans were good, but barely warm. The ginger salad was ok,  but fried won tons with the sweet  sauce were not.So for $22, I really didn't think it was worth it. I will say there are many things to try, and maybe if the sides had been good I would be more eager to try again. And maybe I still will - but with so many Asian  restaurants around, the fact that the shrimp and beef were both not good makes me think probably not."
6/7/2018,4,"Bento Café, welcome to South Florida! Going to school in Gainesville Bento was my no. 1 spot to go for fast casual sushi. When I heard they opened close to my neck of the woods I had to make it out there.YUM! Still just as good as I remember it with friendly and fast service, too.From poke bowls to sushi rolls, their menu is packed with deliciousness. I got the chirashi bowl which was filled with fresh sashimi over a bed of sushi rice. This is a fast casual spot so you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.They offer a make your own poke bowl which is great too. My dining mate added mango to their salmon and tuna poke and it was most definitely photo worthy. Pricing here is on point. Portions are generous for the price too which makes me heart eye emoji the heck out of bento. The parking is plentiful too, although this plaza does get hella busy so you may need to walk a little. Bento, I'm so happy you made your way from Gainesville to Davie. Welcome!"
9/12/2016,5,"Going to college in Florida, everyone who's gone to UF or even UCF should have some recollection of visiting Bento Cafe at least once in their life (and if not, you're missing out). Being here for optometry rotations, I was ecstatic knowing they'd be opening relatively close to my family's house. Like all the other locations, decor is a modern Asian feel with their signature red theme (most locations are either red or blue). Cool music playing and plenty of seating. It's located within a plaza so there is ample parking spaces. Bento Cafe offers a delicious variety of Asian food and sushi alongside a boba tea bar. Between every location, a few menu items are different and/or absent, but the favorites always remain. If you crave hot food, my personal recommendations include beef bulgogi, curry katsu, Mongolian steak, and my ultimate favorite: spicy cream. For these dishes, you choose the entree and then you can pick between a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or a bento box (comes with different sides: lo mein, salad, string beans, and rice). For sushi, my personal recommendations include the special Mexican, mt. Fuji, hot lava, and Miami roll. DON'T FORGET THE SPICY MAYO. Their recipe is unique and packs a lot of flavor unlike most other restaurants in the area. Boba is delicious and I always favor taro, matcha, strawberry, mango, (and even a combo strawberry mango), etc. All is good!Dishes range from $4-$10 which is why this place is a STEAL. For what it's worth, this place is BOMB, super affordable, and a cool place to hang out."
9/21/2019,5,"I can't believe I haven't done a review for this fusion spot yet. Originally was introduced to Bento in downtown Orlando. This spot is modern, clean, and has a nice relaxed environment. The service is fast and efficient. Order your food at the counter and have it brought to your table. I order the same thing here all the time which is the pao pao chicken with white rice in a bowl. My all time favorite dish. I've tried a few other dishes and I can't order anything else. The staff is very friendly, plenty of seating, and you may need to park a few ways since it's always busy. The sushi isn't bad, wasn't a fan of the boba tea, and they have an array of drinks. Walk over a little after you finish your entree to phenomenal ice cream and bake shop for some dessert."
11/16/2019,4,"This was my first time hearing about or patronizing this restaurant. I stopped in with a friend for an early dinner, & although the establishment looks like a typical chain restaurant, I was impressed with the quality and taste of the food. The menu has quite a few options & I was happy to see a variety of sushi options on the menu. I ordered a Mongolian beef white rice bowl & a sushi box with 4 Mt Fugi rolls. My rice bowl was delivered to my table very quickly & my sushi followed awhile after but I could tell there was a wait for sushi based on the customers lined up in front of the station who weren't dinning in. Both were very tasty. Portion size fit the pricing. My only complaint was the restaurant was uncomfortably cold to an extreme I've never experienced before. It being chilly outside did not make it any better. Tables come with chopsticks, however there are no other silverware, napkins or condiments available which is a slight inconvenience. Especially with the food being delivered to the table, however there is a station in the back corner of the restaurant where all these items can be found. I would patronize this restaurant again."
6/13/2018,4,"This place is quite the gem, it's a little difficult to get to but it's total worth it. It's definitely your money's worth and it's not overly expensive!I ordered the garlic chicken broccoli bento & sautéed mixed vegetables with chicken an green tea passionfruit boba tea. The bentos were amazing, flavorful and a good amount I was very happy with it. As for the boba tea, a bit disappointed. The tea was very bitter, I'm not sure if it was a new batch, the tapioca was small and not great in texture. Can probably get boba tea somewhere else for a better price and flavor. Besides that, there was a long line which I though would take forever but it was so quick. Great customer service. I can not wait to come back and try more bento boxes!!"
9/24/2016,5,"Recently opened up in the same plaza as Bestbuy.  As a Asian from Los Angeles who had numerous good options, Bento has quality options.Since its new, it does get quite busy with a long line to order. I had the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. It was surprisingly good, almost on the same level as Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Rou Mian) in LA. Order it with the mini Udon noodles.I also had a make your own Pokebowl. With the option of brown rice or white rice, or vegetable bottom. The option for 3 proteins is great. The quality of the fish was superb, flavored really well, and super soft and fresh. The Salmon poke, Tuna poke and marinated salmon were great options."
9/20/2016,5,"So exciiiiiited to have a Bento in SoFlo! The long awaited opening of this location is finally over. It's located right off of 595 in Davie in the Tower Shoppes newest building along with other businesses new to the plaza. It's a 'wait in line to order and they'll bring your food and drinks to you' type restaurant, which from a business POV is probably a smarter choice to get people in and out quicker, but it sucks when the line can be out the door. My Bento loving bf and I ordered the beef bulgogi rice bowl along with the Crunch sushi roll. Both were really yummy  no complaints there. I'm in a miso soup phase, so there was also an order of that and I was recommended to try the jasmine milk tea by a friend - both were also delish! I didn't get it with the boba b/c it was just too sweet. The wait time for the food wasn't long at all considering the amount of customers and the ambience of the place was very chic and modern. Service was also very friendly. Nonetheless, we will definitely return."
4/15/2018,4,My first visitIt could be a little intimidating not understanding everything thing on the menu. The food was excellent. It was delivered quickly and hot. We were with my grandson who made suggestionsWe will return.
11/17/2018,4,"Everything was delicious and boy the quantity of food was perfection. If, you're getting the teriyaki chicken get the extra sauce as well. It really tops off your dish. The restaurant was really busy but they had a whole lot of cashiers to cash people out so the wait time wasn't long. The only downfall is the location town shops are  busy on the weekend so it's kind of hectic to exit to get to back onto the main road. The upside the smoothies are delicious or should I say the ice smoothies are great I had a passion fruit smoothie with strawberry boba.   Now that was the piece de resistance. I would just come back for that alone. Their pumpkin spice wontons were delicious too but $5 for the quanity they give is not worth it they should bring the piece down."
2/16/2020,4,"This is my favorite sushi place. If you're not up for  rolls or sashimi, choose a poke bowl or soup. Bento has a wide selection for your Asian cravings.Bento in Davie gets my ""thumbs up!"""
12/15/2018,5,"I used to go here and order something different off the menu and always thought that it was just ""ok"". My friend told me to try the spicy cream/pow pow dish and it changed my life!! Seriously I've been going and ordering the spicy cream shrimp with udon noodles taking out the string beans and peppers and adding broccoli and it's soooo delicious! I also order a Mexican roll to share with my partner and I love it so much. I also tried the spicy cream with chicken and it's soooo delicious. It's always slammed here and now I know."
8/18/2018,5,Holy delicious Batman. This was my first bento box and I was definitely happy with the experience. The food came out really quick and they serve sake which is amazing!!I've eaten at the Orlando one that is more of a sit down with a server restaurant. Here you place your order at the counter sit down and it's delivered. I Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fresh bite of Asian fusion!
10/14/2016,5,"We're new to the area so scoping out new places is a priority, so Bento Cafe was near the top of the list given the reviews. We came in for dinner on a weeknight and I'll start by saying long lines are usually my kryptonite but I pushed through and it wasn't half as bad as some other fast casual places. In fact, the line moved rather quickly plus it allowed me some time to figure out what to order because their menu does offer quite a variety - something for literally everyone.Our order consisted of fried pork dumplings, a poke bowl (love the ability to customize!), and beef bulgogi with rice and 2 drinks which cost around $30. Slightly more than other similar type concept restaurants but the quality and amount of food was a good value -- my husband saved the second half of his meal since there was enough for lunch the next day. Bonus is that the staff was pleasant and efficient. If given the option to order ahead and pickup I always do, and thankfully they offer this, so it's likely to be in our rotation."
7/27/2018,3,"This is a nice, open, bright restaurant. After ordering at the front, you can take your number to a table and wait a very short time for your meal! The menu itself is expansive, with hot meals on one side including stir-frys, fried tempura meals, even soups, and a sushi menu on the back. The best part on the menu, if you want to try a little of everything, is one of the bento meals. You can choose a protein and a cooking style, that comes with a bright ginger salad, soba noodles, rice, and some sweet wonton chips. It was a great sample of everything.The ginger chicken I got was coated in a delicious, not heavy ginger sauce, while the soba noodles were unfortunately lukewarm but still tasted okay. Not much flavor. The miso soup I ordered along with the meal was delicious and hot!Come here for a fast, flavorful cheaper meal!"
5/29/2020,5,"First time order, was fresh hot and delivered. Most of all Delicious. Pao pao undon noodle bowl with chicken. Ok I should also mention the online ordering wasn't too hard to navigate and process."
2/13/2021,5,"Great spot for on the go or to sit down. They have a big menu to choose from, which seems overwhelming but honestly everything I've gotten here is so good. I love how they offer both 4piece & 8piece sushi rolls. The Pao Pao spicy cream chicken is my absolute favorite! Bento is a must try because you'll love it!"
7/25/2021,5,This is actually from my kid: I like the chicken because it was crispy and the sweet hard noodles and I loved the rice in my box.
8/18/2018,5,"I have been to the Bentos in Orlando and I am happy that the quality of this location was the same.Good atmosphere, very reasonably priced food and good service. I barely had time to fill a water cup before my order was delivered to my table.Bento boxes are the way to go. I love the sriracha garlic chicken and it was nice that they offer cold sake on the side. I haven't had a bad experience at Bentos yet (especially with Bento boxes)!I love this place."
9/13/2019,5,"Wow just wow. A friend of mine has been telling me about Bento box for what seems like months now and I have finally experienced it for myself. Step aside Pei Wei there is a new sheriff in town. We arrived early based on her recommendation to beat the lunch rush and I'm glad that we did because the place was very busy by the time we left. The menu is quite large and as a first time or a little overwhelming. I figured since I was at Bento box I should have a Bento box. Typically I go with something like a Kung pao or general tsos. but my friend recommended the pao pao which is like a creamy kung pao, it was addicting! My bento box had brown rice, chicken, lo mein noodles, sautéed string beans, a small salad with ginger dressing, and some crispy cinnamon sugar fried wontons. There was so much food! I was so happy! Everything tasted delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try one of the many other offerings that they have. Note I did Take a peek at the tuna poke bowl and it looked super fresh and big portions. There is one of these coming to Pembroke Pines in my area and I cannot wait!"
10/12/2018,5,"The food here is always great! It's normally always really busy, so now whenever I'm craving sushi I always call ahead and it's typically ready in 10 mins. Their sushi combination box is my favorite because it's very filling and affordable especially for sushi which I think is sort of pricey. It comes with 8 pieces of California roll and 4 pieces of 2 different types of speciality roll (they have a big list to choose from) it also comes with some sort of onion and cucumber side which is yum! The chicken katsu noodle bowl with the curry red sauce is my go-to when I don't get sushi. It's delicious. The fried wontons are great too!"
4/11/2018,4,First time having dinner here and can say for a quick bit of Asian food this place was great. I had ordered the Shrimp pad tai without peanut and a 4 count of their Special Mexican rolls. The pad tai was amazing the sushi was okay. I also ordered the pineapple green tea which I wasn't a fan of. The tea seemed prepackaged and the pineapple flavoring was like a gel at the bottom of the cup. No amount of mixing infused the tea and pineapple flavoring. Place was really clean. Lovely helpful staff. Good affordable pricing.
12/28/2017,4,"If you're in Tower Shops, enjoy Japanese ""fast food,"" and can find a parking space, you should try Bento. If you're like me and find the huge ""build your own"" stir fry, noodle bowls, sushi, or poke bowls just too much on your first or second visit, go with one of the set menu items. I don't think you'll be disappointed. These ingredients go together and will be well prepared. I've read some of the marginal reviews of Bento, and think many of them are due to the patron's ingredients choices, rather than Bento. Sometimes people just pick a bad combination of ingredients. That said, I agree that the staff could be friendlier. Knowing I'm not a chef, I've chosen a tuna poke bowl and a salmon poke bowl. I really love the fresh and cold fish, spicy mayo, avocado, cucumber, masago, and mango combined with the warm rice. Delish!"
1/23/2021,1,Waiting for and order we placed inside for takeout and the people that order for eat it get service first?!? Why when we were in line first? Not great customer service and cooks are just playing around instead of doing their job of getting people out of here!
12/27/2017,2,"FAST FOOD: As much as I like the concept of this contemporary bento style local chain serving Pan-Asian cuisine in my neighborhood (and believe me i gave this place a chance and visited 3 times to ensure my review is fair), this is a prepackaged FAST FOOD, nothing else. The food lacks flavor and character. In a very serious way. Very bland, it is not your flavorful pan-Asian fare you are expecting. Not as advertised either. The place certainly brings a lot of traffic especially of a younger age simply because there isn't any contemporary Asian cuisines in the area, it's located next to shopping plaza, and because it was originally open for hungry college students. Location, location, and novelty. Not a bad idea.WE TRIED: We have tried their edamame, garlic adamae, pad thai noodle bowl, rice bowls, Surf n' Turf with chicken and spicy tuna, wakame, cucumber and avocado. Nothing extraordinary. No flavor at all in my opinion. My son couldn't even finish his dumplings saying it didn't taste as good as in other places. When we tried it again during our following visit i noticed it was out of the box. So yes, frozen tasteless boiled dumplings being served here. I wasn't impressed with my sushi either. Only 10 types of sushi offered here, and I believe we tried about 5...not impressed. Mainstream, tasteless. Crowd-oriented, the food has to be served bento-style...quickly, and you get a tasteless Asian-style food which is not freshly made. SUMMARY: Good bento-style fast food concept, but when the food is bland and the brand fails to deliver on high quality fresh Asian food, something is wrong with that picture. My third trip sealed the deal. The place has an audience in all 9 locations, but I don't fit in this audience. I enjoy a good Asian food, this place doesn't do it for me."
2/18/2021,2,"Mediocre sushi, long waits, and poor customer service.  Called to place an order. They picked up. Placed me on hold.  12 minutes later I had driven there, parked, walked in, waited for cashier, and showed him I was still on hold 14 minutes later, and there was only 3 customer in the place. He either forgot I was on hold, or didn't care. So I waited 20 minutes for 2 sushi rolls.Gave it another shot a few weeks later, ordered on line, had items delivered only to find the Boba tea I ordered for my daughter was made wrong. No Boba. That was the whole reason she wanted it so she didn't drink it. I called. Guy said sorry I will comp it for you next time you order. OK. Today I called the store to see if he was there. Said I was coming in for the drink. Girl on phone said I go ahead come in, we wont charge you for it. I go. They charge me for $4 for the drink and said well we didn't charge you for the Boba. Um, that is not what I was promised.  Your customer service sucks. You are slow. Sushi is just OK.  Taking my business elsewhere."
3/26/2018,5,"Bento is an amazing place to enjoy lunch with some friends on the weekends. If you're looking for sushi, rice bowls or other Asian goodness then you're in luck.As you enter be sure to grab a menu so you can decide what to get before you get to the cashier. The menu has a ton of options, priced well. It seems like most people go for the sushi however there are plenty of other options. I opted for the red curry rice bowl. Drinks include soda and also alcoholic beverages such as bottled beer and sake. There's also boba tea available if you're interested (which you are). The food took about 5-10 minutes to arrive but that time can definitely vary based on your meal. Everything was great - the rice was cooked properly, the red curry was tasty and the chicken pieces, while thinner than I was expecting, were suffice. Portion sizes are fair and I noticed the rice bowls are a bit larger than other entrees.The venue is fairly large with many tables to choose from, but keep in mind they do get very busy around and after lunch so larger groups may find it difficult to sit together. Overall, this will serve your Japanese and Thai cravings with quality meals and proves to be a solid lunch contender."
10/4/2017,4,"I can never say no to poke. After binging on poke in Hawaii I returned back home to find myself longing for that sweet tuna. Thankfully I live a few short minutes from Bento - and while my experience in Orlando was less than stellar, I tried the bowls - rather than the sushi - and I found my new jam.Sure the sushi is cool - but the poke bowls are where the party is at! I will mention that for first timers, it's a super overwhelming menu. There's so many toppings and options. I've ordered the same thing every single time in paralyzing fear of trying to make a new decision.The first time I went with poke bowl and asked the cashier for recommendations - she basically just rattles off everything in the additions. When I asked her her favorites on sauces she once again just rattled off a bunch of he options - couldn't offer a personal recommendation? Meh. I figured it out.Tuna bowl. seaweed. edamame tempora flakes. extra poke sauce. spicy mayo. And then I rotate one more - I've tried the mango and it was a nice sweet addition.I've tried a variety of the hot apps as well. While good, they pale in comparison to the bowl. So yea, get the bowl. It's delicious.Place is nice, modern...with an upbeat playlist and a good amount of seating plus a sushi bar to sit at."
12/22/2017,4,"I got the noodle bowl with teriyaki chicken. If your looking for a meal you can either get a bento box or a bowl. If you want variety, I recommend getting the bento box and if your looking for a simple meal get the bowl. You can also choose which sauces you want in the bowl. The food is good and the teriyaki chicken wasn't dry. The prices ranged from $9-13 depending on what you get. In my opinion, I don't think it is worth it for the amount of chicken and noodles that they give you in a bowl. They have a friendly and hardworking staff. I will definitely come here again to try the bento box and the drinks!"
1/22/2018,4,I've come to Bento Cafe a few times and each of those times the food and service has been fantastic. Since going here I've been craving Poke bowls constantly. This was actually my first experience trying Poke and it was phenomenal. We normally go during the week and it's usually not packed so we would walk right to the register to order. Unfortunately this doesn't give me enough time to figure out what I want to eat haha. So I chose build your own Poke bowls each time so I can't really say which specific meal stood out. I can say that each time the food was fantastic. From the seasoning put into the food and the fish itself you can tell it's fresh. You can really tell they really care about the quality of the food that you order and as I said the service is always great. Everyone that works there always has a smile on their face and are working in a fast pace. Definitely have to go back soon to try more of the food they have to offer. Should also try their pre made Poke bowls and mention them in my review. If you're in a mood for Poke bowls then you should definitely drive to Bento Cafe. The food is great and the service is great. Just a great environment to be around.
9/14/2020,2,"We usually love this place, we always come here. However, today was horrible. We ordered two hours prior, specifically we asked to have the order ready by 7pm, we get here and our order according to them never came through. Even though we were charged and we had a confirmation for the order. So they said they would make it, while waiting for the food we spoke to the manager, Mani (according to him) and he does not even offer a discount for the mix up, until we brought it up. Very disappointing!"
6/13/2020,5,"I absolutely adore Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi!! Eventually I will go to the brick and mortar location but I have been wearing them out with my deliveries the past few months. Everything here is outstanding. Fresh ingredients in delicious dishes are made to order with care. I love love love their poke bowls. You get to select your size and every element that goes into them. My favorites so far are the spicy tuna and the spicy tofu- delicious! The chilled sesame noodle are great on their own so I'll get them as an appetizer sometimes. I really like that you can get a smaller version of sushi rolls there. You get to choose between a small (4 pieces) or a large (8 pieces). This has let me try so many of their rolls I love it! Their version of a Japanese Bagel roll is on point. The smoked salmon is so delicate, paired nicely with avocado and scallions- I always get a small of this one. Still working my way through all the sushi rolls. And don't forget the kimchi! They also have great sauces you can order on the side. I'm addicted to the spicy kobachi and spicy mayo. Every thing I've had here has been really really good. Can't wait to come meet you in person Bento!!"
12/14/2017,5,"Bentos is one of my go to spots. I am so glad they opened one near my house. I am usually here every week. I love the customer service, the employees are quick and nice. I usually order the white rice bowl with Katsu chicken or teriyaki steak with white rice. I also ordered the bento box before and it was just as great. It's inexpensive and definitely a great hangout spot as well."
1/17/2020,4,"This is more or less your typical Asian fusion restaurant that's aimed at a younger crowd. If you are looking for more traditional Asian food then you might be disappointed.The quality of the food is pretty solid. Don't expect to be blown away by the quality but if you are looking for a fast and relatively inexpensive ( for SoFlo) meal then this is your place. They have a pretty large menu but I usually end up getting one of their rice or udon bowls. The quantity is a little on the smaller side for me but I also eat a lot lol.The staff are all very nice as well. I've been here many times over the last few years and I've never had any issues with the staff. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the place."
11/12/2017,4,"Ooh the things I'd do for some bomb sushi.. including driving an hour away and getting lost. I've heard of nothing but great things from BentoCafe..after seeing pictures upon pictures on a yelp I knew I had to try this place out. Definitely did not disappoint! Bento Cafe is very modern and upbeat atmosphere. They have a large sitting area and also a sushi bar where you can sit. We came right before the rush so it was very good timing before noon is good. You go through the line, place an order, they give you a number, you sit and wait...and they bring your food to you. We didn't have to wait very long as the service is pretty quick. The sushi was very fresh and tightly rolled so it didn't break apart as you picked it up.  I ordered the Florida roll, and the riceless kawaii roll. The kawaii resembled more like a spring roll but securely still tasty. Christine M. ordered the spicy cream chicken over rice which looked and smelled yum.  There was so much in a bowl that even the two of us foodies could not finish. I don't know if it was our welcoming aura or our infectious smiles but with all the empty tables around us everyone sat next to us. As if all the food we ordered was not enough, before we left we somehow ended up back in the line ordering drinks to go. With so many choices I ended up going to my go to drink: mango tea.  Super refreshing and not too strong like other places. Definitely come get this place out if your in the area."
9/21/2019,5,"Love Bento! Their bento box, Sushi, & bowl is so delicious! Their service is also very fast and the place isn't expensive their prices are really good. Their menu has a great selection of choices. I got their bento box with Sriracha chicken it comes with white or brown rice but I asked for salad instead of the rice. I would definitely recommend this place if you want something fast and tasty! Can't wait to go back and have their sushi."
2/13/2020,5,"We found Bento because of Door Dash. In one week, we've had them twice. Son 1st had Mongolian Bento Box and Pork Rolls. Loved it. Ordered today because of Milk tea (lychee for me. Honeydew for son). Sooooo good!!!! Also got poke bowl. Very good. I got teriyaki steak Bento box. Amazing!!!!! So tender. So fullllllll. A fantastic find. We'll definitely have them again."
6/10/2019,4,"I'm new to South Florida, and even though this restaurant is a chain, it's still local to Florida, and I've never heard of it until my sister took me. It's set up as a quick-eats type of day place. Stand in line, place your order, take a number to place on your table, and wait for them to bring you your food. I was impressed with the huge selection that they have on their menu. This is an Asian fusion with everything from sushi to Kung Pao to coconut curry, with your choice of protein, including tofu.  I ordered the yellow tofu curry bento box and 4-piece spicy tuna roll. This came with steamed rice, salad with ginger dressing, lo mein, flash-fried green beans, and mini bites of crunchy fry dough drizzled with a sweet vanilla cream sauce (dessert name is ??). I was very impressed with my meal. The wait time from ordering to being served was less than 10 minutes. Almost everything had lots of flavor and the portions were generous. You get a great bang for your buck. IMO, I think that giving lo mein AND rice on the same platter is too much. Same with serving the veggies from the curry, the green beans, AND a salad. There was a little bit of everything to the point where it was almost an afterthought. Would have loved nixing one of the  veggies and have the option of lo mein OR rice and maybe offer the option of 2 entree portions instead of only offering one with all the other sides thrown in whether they go with the meal or not (think Panda Express). Let me not forgot to mention my boba tea with popping boba. MANGO is delish and the lechi popping boba are unreal! Looking forward to checking out more of their menu for sure"
10/2/2017,5,"I don't know what's in their food but it's so addictive. I could come eat here 3-4 days in a row and not get sick of it. I love their sushi and raw food equally as much as the fried food. I did notice that more care is taken for food that I have ordered for dine in vs food for take out. But overall I love coming here on my cheat days. It really satisfies those nasty cravings.I am the type of person, when I find somethings that I like, I will only order those things. So here are the things I get consistently from here. I start with their crab wontons. Surprisingly I like them. Sometimes they're a little too greasy but I love the cream cheese filling and the sweet and sour dipping sauce that comes with it. It's a perfect fried creamy appetizer. For my entrees, bear is mind I come here on days when I'm famished and super hangry so I order like for two. I get their bamboo rolls and one of the noodle entrees. I love the bamboo rolls because I'm not a huge fan of having cream cheese in my sushi. This roll doesn't have that. I also am all about shrimp tempura in my rolls and this has that. This roll is bomb. Is light, fresh and meaty. For the noodle entree my go tos are as follows: either the Korean or the Mongolian flavor. I have gotten the chicken and/ or shrimp. And I would switch up between the udon and the lo mein. Main take aways are: I prefer the shrimp over chicken because if I have any left over, a day old chicken I find inedible. Between the noodles, I think both are great choices. Udon has that meaty bounce that when coated with the flavor of sauce is yum. Lo mein in itself is packed with flavor and fried to perfection. Both varieties of the noodles pair well with the Korean and the Mongolian sauce. These sauces both are similar which is probably why these two are my personal favorite.  They're spicy, oniony, garlicky and packs a little heat. Last piece of advice, call in your order if you're gonna do take out. Then go straight to the cashier that is for takeout only. This place gets crazy packed during rush hour and is not great for those hangry moments."
7/18/2017,5,"Why 5 stars? Because I could eat this poke every day.   ---   ---   ---Ever since Blue A came to my wedding in Hawaii, we've been BPB (not Broward Palm Beach, but Best Poke Buds.) Prior to visiting Blue, I'd been on a solid healthy-eating streak, so I asked him to try to avoid taking me to one of those places where we eat 4,000 calories in one sitting. While later during my visit, he would fail miserably at honoring that request, for this particular meal - we ate relatively clean.I actually visited the Bento Cafe in Orlando and thought it was 'okay.' We ate sushi, and I remember thinking that it was kind of unremarkable. But that was prior to when I developed an insatiable craving for poke at all times of the day. We built our own bowl, and were allotted 3 different meats. On the menu, they tuna poke and salmon poke, so I doubled up on tuna to give account for 2/3rds of the protein, and I did not regret it. It was so damn delicious, I wanted a whole 'nother bowl when I was done. It was honestly some of the best poke I've had outside of Hawaii.As I pen this review a week later, I'm now depressed that I'm not currently sitting inside Bento Cafe eating poke!"
7/30/2017,3,"On the fence about Bento. Considering it is in this ""booming"" new area of the Tower Shops you literally have to fight off an old lady,pay someone, or do a tribal dance to get a parking spot. When we arrived the line was practically out the door; good and bad sign. Since it was my first time it allowed me to thoroughly review the menu (more than once) so I was prepared when I got to the front. When we did get to the front to order the girl at the register was not pleasant. Like, serious RBF! There was no ""hi"", ""welcome"", ""is it your first time?""... nothing. She just stood there waiting for us to say something. I realize it's a busy Saturday night but seriously a little customer service and pleasantly goes a long way dear. I ordered an appetizer of steamed dumplings, Pokè bowl and a plain black tea. Trying to find a clean table was a challenge so I asked an employee that was walking past to send someone over to clean the table, which they did right away. However, the floors in the place were gross. Liquids, wrappers, and trash everywhere! I think this had to do with the fact that they don't have lids for their cups and there's kids running around everywhere spilling drinks. I don't think I saw one employee walking around maintaining the cleanliness of the dining area the entire time we were there. Our food came surprisingly fast considering how busy it was and I was honestly shocked that everything was piping hot and the orders were correct. That was their only saving grace for me to be honest. The dumplings were pretty big and tasty and the pokè bowl ingredients were super fresh. I liked that they had a mixed greens option instead of rice which was surprisingly good. The only thing I thought was weird was the tea I ordered came in a boba tea cup and was room temp with no ice. It was a bit of a struggle to get the government sealed plastic lid off the top so I could pour it into a cup of ice. Overall, not bad but also not super great. I think in the future I'd probably order to go or come at a less busy time but considering the area that's probably never."
1/27/2019,4,"This place is too yummy! I've tried the rice bowls, bento boxes, and sushi! They are all delicious! The only thing that kinda sucks is the line gets SUPER long sometimes and if you try and order take out they take FOREVER to answer the phone... or they just don't answer. However, the tasty food definitely makes up for it!!!! P.S- if you do order take out they say it's normally 15 min till your food ready but 9 times out of 10 it'll be ready in 5!!!"
9/12/2020,5,Love me some Bento Poke Bowls! Gotta try em! Amazing!!! The service is very fast and easy. People are very friendly. And whoever installed the tiles there... did a fantastic job. ;-)
8/28/2019,5,Amazing food and great sushi. Love the Bubble Tea definitely a great spot for good food.
7/9/2021,1,"The service was unacceptable, it took 40 minutes to make three items with an empty line yet tons of messy tables. It seems like no one does much around here besides stare into the sky due to their lack of urgency. Multiple tables were complaining about the food coming out incorrect and with no sense of order. It is absolutely ridiculous that the management cannot seem to comprehend simple tasks such as delivering proper organizational skills to the staff and facility. This is the last time my family and I will be spending money at this establishment because of the horrible customer service. The experience overall was negative and I wish I could put 0 stars instead of 1."
10/13/2017,5,"This is a fast food type of Japanese/Pan Asian menu. The place is cute and conveniently located to several other walkable shops. The people are friendly. I love the ahi poke bowl, pad Thai, although a bit spicy for me and I've tried several sushi rolls all delicious."
2/24/2018,4,"We went to Bento tonight, and I can only describe it as what Pei Wei used to be about 5 years ago.  It's the same concept of standing in line to place your order at the registers and you are given a number to place on your table.  We had the Mango & Lychee Boba Teas, 3Pc Salmon Sashimi, and for entrees, I had the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup and my 8 yr old had the Teriyaki Pork Lo Mein Noodle Bowl.  Our friends had the Cali Roll, Korean Chicken Bowl and Fried Chicken Bowl.  The food and drinks were brought out very quickly and I was very impressed at how the service flowed so efficiently.I would have given the 5-Stars, but the cashier who rang up the order had such a thick accent and spoke so fast, that I couldn't understand half of what she was saying, and she never let me know that they had a Kid's Box (which I just found out about while writing this review) and that would have cut down the order time in half, and we also would not have had the mix-up with my son's Mango Boba Tea.Overall, a very nice dining experience and everyone there was very pleasant and helpful.  We will be back with the family."
1/10/2018,5,My go to is the build your own poke bowl. Half spicy tuna and half salmon is the way to go! Best of both worlds :)The $10 sushi bento box is also a good choice. Don't forget to ask for a side of spicy mayo - it's good!Line is usually to the door but don't worry it moves fairly quickly and is worth the wait.
5/21/2019,5,So yummy! First time here and babe and I had a nice quiet lunch date. I recommend it because it is nice and fresh and the restaurant is very clean and neat. Definitely going back and just FYI the plaza has alot of nice restaurants nearby; plus a shopping area!
10/10/2017,4,"Love love love in a bowl!!!!! I've been hearing about these many locations of Bento for awhile now and I finally made my ways to the Davie location. I got there about 45 mins after their open hours and they were already packed. I went on to order the Spicy Cream Chicken with white rice and I have no regrets. They give you such a good portion that I didn't even finish my food. The rice was of great texture. Not dry nor too soggy. They gave you a load of chicken, and the sauce was So on point .  I also got the Florida Roll, which had my two favorites, tuna and salmon. When you order sush, you have an option of 4 or 8 pieces. I thought that concept was pretty cool. The place was very clean.very spacious. Staff was sweet. Everyone literally had a smile on their face. I would've given them five stars but after my meal I got a Milk Tea with Almond and it was okayy. Not the best but okay.  Their boba jelly was a bit too Chewy, that made me not want to finish my drink. All in all a very SUCCESSFUL trip to Davie for yummy food."
7/21/2017,3,"As a UF Alum (Go Gators!), the Bento Cafe franchise has a special place in my heart, as I used to go when only Bento Red and Bento Blue (sounds like Pokémon games haha) existed in Gainesville. So when I found out the franchise finally made their way to South Florida, nostalgia kicked in and I could not wait to go! But because of nostalgia, I had to give this place 3 stars. Going off of the fact that I would have given the original Bentos 4 stars back in the day and rating it as a stand alone restaurant: This restaurant is busy, always. And the main reason why is that it is next to a busy area and near a university (Nova), which the owners seem to like to choose, location wise. It is a order and then sit yourself type of place. I have been to this location twice, the first time just to order bubble tea, and the second time to order a dinner entry. Both times, orders were taken very slowly and it seemed like there were more people standing behind the counter waiting to serve. The servers themselves were actually helpful and quick once you did place your order and deliver the food to your table.I ordered a Passion Fruit green boba tea, which was way too sweet to even taste the green tea, sweeter than I ever ordered before at the original Bentos. Recently, I ordered a build your own poke-bowl, which is priced based on how many types of protein you get. While the poke-bowl itself was very tasty, they did get my 2nd protein wrong, but I didn't say anything so I can't say what they would have done if I actually asked them to correct it. The sashimi in my bowl was fresh, and the portion size was just right, considering I just came from a Zumba class. They do have many other dishes (try a creative sushi special or the Spicy Cream Chicken, so good!), and their Bento box is particularly popular and a great meal value. On average, I spend about $12-15 on a meal here.The ambience is noisy and loud with pumping music. There was plenty of seating and the interior felt very clubbish. All of this is common amongst the other Bentos in Florida (I've been to the one in Jacksonville too) so at least they are consistent? In the end, my tastes may be different from my undergrad days, which is probably why I really didn't rave about this bento like I did back in the day. Still, a good option for lunch or dinner if you're craving a good Asian inspired meal if you're in the Davie Area!"
4/11/2018,5,I came to Bento for lunch and they are always pack. You can order take out and eat in. I order pad Thai and the bowl size is a good size for one person. I really like my dish I order the flavor was not too much but too little. Many Thai places lack the pad Thai sauce but Bento had it on point. I always come here when I am craving my favorite dish. Thanks for the great experience!
10/15/2017,5,"If you're in the plantation area, be sure to hit up Bento Cafe! It's like a quick service Asian fusion chipotle. The menu is jam packed with affordable deliciousness - everything from sushi and poke bowls to noodles and curry.. all served fresh in minutes!Poke bowl - can't go wrong here! Build your own bowl- one protein starting at $10, then add $1 per additional protein (up to three proteins), and tons of add in options like avocado, masago, wakame, tempura flakes.. the list goes on.Tuna poke bowl is a great choice for tuna lovers that are first timers here. Boba tea - plenty of flavor option here as well! The tea menu is next to the registers where you orderDream - coconut and taro milk tea is drrreeeammmyDefinitely plan on coming back to explore the endless menu at Bento."
11/6/2020,1,I Have order Tempura Shrimp（3） and pineapple  But take a look at home no have ，Doesn't feel good
3/1/2019,5,"What a fabulous place! The food is really good. You can make your own bowl which is what we did. You choose the protein, the add ins and the Extras and the sauce all for one low price. They also have sushi rolls, salads and more. They have an awesome Coke machine where you can create your own flavors. Super clean place and great service. The only down side was there is not any WiFi and we couldn't do any of our work while we were there."
4/18/2017,4,"Ducked in for a high powered sales meeting and it was a fine time, here's why: * Lots of nearby parking * 2 hotties joined along * Busy and popular place with the college set* Lots of options* Fairly priced* Lots of foodCabeza OUT!"
7/11/2020,4,"Good fast-casual style Asian restaurant similar to pei wei style. The spicy poyo cream sauce chicken is my favorite with a pineapple green tea boba. The kids meals are fun for the little ones, served in a bento style box with cinnamon crisp chips as a little desert. They have reduced their capacity 50% due to COVID and seemed to be enforcing guidelines."
10/24/2020,1,"Check your bags when you order pick-up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Every single time we go to pick up, there is at least one item missing and we have to go back to ask for it. After it happened the first time, it was no big deal, people make mistakes but this has happened multiple times. Today, it was a busy day and the restaurant was full so we had to wait a really long time just to get the correct order we had paid for. For the inconvenience, they couldn't even offer an apology. They said we could get a refund for the item... how about the food that I originally ordered!??!! it's not my fault they made a mistake."
5/21/2017,5,"We come here anytime we want an Asian fix. Wifey gets plenty of tasty vegan choices and there's something for everyone. Reminiscent of a Pei Wei but with better quality and choices. The curry is nice and portions are generous without going overboard. They have ramen, udon, Taiwanese noodles, brown and white rice for starches. Plus you choose the protein (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu, etc) and veggies."
9/6/2019,3,"Ok so I have been a fan of Bentos for a long time and mein I loved it!  But today was not one of there best  it seems that they are going down on quality, from the to go bentos box plate to the food quality is different!!!! The bento box plate use to be a high quality I use to even reuse it, and the lo mein was dry  and the chicken seemed to have been cooked hours ago it didn't taste fresh (was chewy texture) and the little wonton dessert had no sauce the use sugar now, not a good combo  I don't know, but this version of the bentos is one that is not too good, please bring back your quality, I would hate to see your loyal customers like myself start finding other options"
4/6/2017,4,"Conveniently placed in the Towers Shoppes plaza, Bento is a great option for lunch or dinner! I have eaten here many times and its perfect for when you just need a quick pick. The line to order usually moves very fast and although it takes sometime to get your food out to your table, its never disappointing. Bento has something for everyone. Those who want raw fish or won't eat raw food. Rice dishes, noodle dishes, poke bowls, sushi.... They have it all!The menu features a wide variety of items and I have been happy with almost everything I have tried. My favorite sushi: Lust roll. Filled with spicy tuna and topped with fried fish. Super decadent and deliciousFavorite hot items: Spicy creamy chicken with the mini udon noodles. I have also tried the spicy creamy shrimp, but I found that there is much more batter than shrimp. Also make sure to try any of the spicy creamy dished with their white sauce! This is recommended to me by one of the cashiers and it definitely gives it extra depth of flavor.In the mood for a rice dish? Try the Japanese curry pork katsu. I was extremely surprised to have liked this dish as much as I did! Very crispy fried pork with a flavorful curry on the side. SO GOOD. SO MUCH COMFORT.Poke bowls are also very satisfying and filling when you are in the mood for raw fish. You get to choose different toppings to go with your protein choice, its all customizable.Things I may not recommend: boba teas. I'm just not a fan of powdered drinks. Id rather get my boba fix else where"
5/7/2020,1,"Bento was one of our favorite places to go until the last few months. We always order tofu in our bowls, we have given this place at least 3 chances to get better and for those past three the tofu is not editable. It's hard and and very hard to chew, definitely way over cooked and the green beans aren't even cleaned (see pic)!  This makes me so sad because the sauce on the sweet n sour and sesame is so delicious but now I don't even want to come back. I'm not sure about the meat because we are vegetarian. I don't think I will return again. Completely disappointed."
8/4/2017,2,"Giving this place this rating solely on their sashimi. So thick it was almost like a steak. It may not be good for some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my husband. Now, the line was huge. The menu a bit confusing   The food, I guess I was expecting more, but the rice was dry. The Szechuan chicken didn't taste like I remember Szechuan is supposed to taste. I asked for additional sauce to wet the rice and the guy said it was an additional 1.06 and then said never mind I'll just get it for you. Overall, I think this is the new thing, but I didn't find it was somewhere I'd venture back to. If by chance I did go back, I would try something completely different. My husband had he Korean shrimp wok, and he too was disappointed."
11/23/2020,1,"Eaten here many times so I was disgusted to find out it was shut down temporarily by the health department for, among other things:""Sewage/wastewater backing up through floor drains. Observed cooks working in standing water at cook line in the kitchen.""To think my food may have been prepared by cooks standing in sewage water is unfathomable to me. How did you guys not immediately fix this? Who in their right mind would continue to prepare and serve food in such unsanitary conditions? You're dealing with people's health here. Completely lost my trust in this place."
9/27/2020,3,The miso soup is good. The ginger salad is not your traditional ginger dressing that you're accustomed to from Asian restaurants. So that's different. I got the steak teriyaki. Absolutely disgusting. Idk what cut of meat it is but it was gross. I couldn't eat it. Did you also know that this place doesn't have knives so I couldn't cut my food? Very odd experience here tonight.
7/15/2019,4,"Great spot for lunch. Perhaps you've noticed the rise of restaurants that seem to want to be above fast food but aren't quite a sit-down restaurant. Examples off of the top of my head would be Pieology (pizza), PDQ (chicken), BurgerFi (burgers), Dickey's Barbecue (bbq), etc. This is one of those places.You essentially choose whether you want rice, noodles, or the bento box. Then you get to choose your protein (meat) and flavor/sauce.I got the szechaun bento box with chicken. Everything was very good and I'd be happy to come back for lunch in the future."
12/23/2020,5,"London may be 10 hours away but he rocks Bento Asian kitchen, great management young man!!  all of almost maybe 24 years old ... He took my needs and wants a head of everything else that night and,  gave me everything I wanted. I see you hustling London keep it going good work!  I will be back"
5/8/2021,1,"Horrible food waste of $$$ rice was horrible ,the orange chicken was disgusting . The bento place was horrible everything we ate was gross, never going back to this place ."
9/30/2018,4,Great spot for lunch or dinner. Line is usually pretty long but it goes quick. I have always ordered their spicy tuna poke bowl. It is filling and fresh. The blend of flavor it perfect. You can make your own also. Service is always great and food comes out quick and fresh.
3/31/2019,4,"Great for lunch, it is an upscale Chipotle but  w/ good Asian food. you pay as you order, you take a seat when you take a number they will bring your food to you. The food is fresh, service is friendly but ill dock 1 star for NO WIFI."
4/15/2021,2,The bento box was decent.  I like the chicken.  Everything else in the box was just ok.  The lo mein noodles were linguine noodles which was odd.  The sushi is seriously some of the worst sushi I have ever eaten. It did not taste fresh.  I also had to wait over 20 min for my to-go order and they weren't even busy.
6/21/2019,4,"Ended up coming here because the other poke place in this plaza was closed. No regrets. The food was amazing. I ordered the Mongolian bowl with fried rice & my husband ordered the Pao Pao bowl with fried rice. We also tried the dragon roll which was delicious as well.  The food was hot, fresh, & came quickly. Good portion sizes. Great service as well. Only issue I had here was the import drinks were pricey ($14) & they only had 2 of the boba & green tea flavors available. All in all Definitely would comeback again."
6/5/2020,4,"Bento Davie is a wonderful establishment that offers some of the best Asian cousins in town. One of my personal favorites is the Poke bowl where you can customize the contents of your bowl to tailor to your liking. Bento also has an amazing atmosphere, perfect to sit down with clients."
5/31/2019,5,"Great place, they consistently put out good food. They have a lot of options wether you want sushi, poke bowl, soups or a bento box this is why my family likes it so much. My favorite is the poke bowl, I usually get a small (it's big enough) and a ramen soup (also very big). They have available white, whole wheat or cauliflower rice to go with your dish. There is a discount if you follow them on Instagram."
12/7/2016,4,"I honestly think they're a 3.5. Each time I've come here (usually with a group of people), a dish is typically forgotten... :( And so someone from our table ends up having to follow up at least once or twice with the cashiers to see where our missing items are.Other than that, the food is good. :) I typically love getting the build your own poké bowl! I'm a total salmon fan, so I usually go wittthhh...BROWN RICE (but they always forget ;_;)PROTEINS (up to 3!)+ Salmon+ Spicy Marinated Salmon, and because I'm not a complete salmon savage...+ TunaADDITIONS (up to 4!)+ Avocado+ Tempura Flakes+ Nori+ Masago(I'm kind of craving poké now, you guys...)SAUCESFan of the white sauce ;) haha, or spicy mayo!Something equally delicious as the build your own poké bowl is the Spicy Cream Shrimp dish (from the Wok section). It's sweet/spicy and delicious. Insert aghhh emoji face here. Just had dinner, but now I'm getting hungry again haha.So, yes. Definitely give this place a try! :) The only downside is that they can forget some items (maybe cos each time I came, I came with a group of like 5/6 people? Things get lost easily?). But other than that, customer service is always lovely and the food is yum!"
5/24/2021,5,"Excellent service, Lyne was so helpful in helping me with my order. The food was so fresh and delicious. Beautiful location where you can park on either side of the Restaurant."
10/19/2020,3,"We have been ordering Bento ToGo for months now due to COVID and we have always been satisfied. The food is always delicious. So while out today, we decided to dine in. I ordered the regular poke bowl with spicy tofu, avocado, cucumber, asparagus, tempura flakes, fried onions, and wonton strips. My wife ordered the katsu bowl with udon noodles and green beans. The food was delicious but my poke bowl was missing the avocado, fried onions, and tempura flakes and my wife's was missing the green beans. I only noticed the avocado at first and spoke to the cashier. I literally received 1 slice of avocado cut in half. When realizing that my dish was still missing items and so was my wife's we decided to just finish eating and leave. We will probably not dine in again."
4/24/2019,5,"I used to enjoy eating at Bento when I was attending the University of Florida. I was sooooooooooo excited when I learned that a location was opening up in south Florida. This was my second time at this location and I was not disappointed. I ordered Pad Thai over the phone as a to go order. My order was ready when I arrived. It was full of flavor. I am patiently waiting for the Pembroke Pines location to open. Until then, I will definitely return to this location."
2/19/2017,4,This place is always busy every time I come here. What's good though is the service is pretty quick. If you want a quick bite of some asian fusion food I'd suggest coming here. Staff is nice and it's pretty clean inside. One thing I was pretty sad about though was that the night I went Bento was out of regular boba.. That's actually the reason I decided to go there was for the boba tea. Hopefully the next time I go back they'll have some.
6/2/2019,5,"This place is awesome! The ambiance is nice, food is great, and staff is nice. The Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup is great. The level of spiciness can't be changed though. The Pineapple fried rice is good too. Their Thai tea is amazing! It's flavorful. They need to put another soda machine though. I highly recommend it."
8/14/2017,4,"Fun way to eat your Asian cravings, place is always packed and for a reason: food is amazing and the menu is very extensive. Poke bowls, bento boxes, sushi, soups, noodles, etc are offered. I always get the poke bowls and they never have disappointed me, the ingredients are always fresh and very tasty, always on target and well presented. Lines are long as you have to order to a cashier and they'll bring your stuff to your table. Atmosphere is busy, noisy and fun. Just go!!!"
11/11/2016,4,"Bento had been a favorite for many UF Gators and Gainesville folks cause it was one of the few Asian fusion restaurants in the city. When we didn't have much to choose from, this was top notch. Finally, Bento expanded to South Florida. Now that I'm not in my college years anymore, I thought that Bento was decent but not the most amazing Chinese or sushi restaurant I can find. It's fast, convenient and the staff is friendly. However, come on a week night and definitely be prepared to wait in line.... A long one. You order at the counter, pay and get a number, then sit and wait for the server to bring your food out. They have noodle bowls, rice bowls, bento boxes, a huge list of sushi rolls and lots of Boba tea mixes. It's a mix of Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine. Me and my friend got a Crunchy roll to split. It was a big portion and delicious as I remembered it. Crispy outside and soft inside. The filling was cooked just right. I also got a poke bowl with 3 proteins-tuna, salmon, eel. There was alot of rice but not alot of fish. Only two tiny pieces of eel. They were gracious on the avocado but I still felt a bit sad on the balance of fish to rice. At the Gainesville location, the tuna and salmon dons ate packed to the brim. For the cost, I would've expected more."
7/28/2017,4,"I finally stopped by even thou seemed a little busy for the 12-2 pm lunch rush hour. It was a bit overwhelming ( the menu ) with so many options. I finally settled in a lechee canned drink ( to the left of the cashiers)  on a open refrigerator. Was soooooo good a must have !!!! Then I ordered a ginger salad, 2 veggie spring rolls and a volcano roll. All of it was $19.61. Towards the back of the restaurant is where you get your chop sticks napkins silver ware. My ginger salad came out quick and was good. Lettuce pieces were not cut into bite size so just a little awkward eating some of it - really not a big deal. Then the spring rolls came out, yummy ! And then the sushi roll. Not my favorite I'm just use to a different roll from every other place I've ordered. The fish was ok, it again not my favorite. I will give it another try since there is so much food I want to try out. Very quick service. Oh please tip !!!!the staff does a great job getting your food out to you and cleaning up."
12/9/2016,3,"So all my friends have been raving about this place and I had to see what the big deal was. Their menu is pretty extensive and it took me a bit to figure out what I wanted. I decided to get some poke and milk tea. I asked the cashier for some suggestions which I quickly realized was a mistake. None of them seemed to be that familiar with the menu/ingredients either. Salmon poke bowl - Made my own bowl with asparagus, avocado, mango, mushrooms, plus ginger and chili sauce which came on the side. It was a good mix, but there was SOO much rice! By the end there was still enough rice for 1-2 more bowls. What a waste.Pineapple milk tea - Not sure if it was the milk tea itself or the combo with pineapple, but it just tasted...odd...and had a weird aftertaste. Do not recommend.Overall, I can see why this place is popular since you can customize your order, but it's not without issues."
5/16/2021,1,"55 minutes for an order for two to be given. Very very long wait. Would not recommend people to come here when hungry. If so come two hours before you are ready to eat. They also did not go in order, people after us were receiving  food while we were still waiting. I even heard two families complaining about the same issue."
10/14/2016,4,"Bento is a great addition to the Davie restaurant scene!  Bento is fast casual Asian and delivers with very good food and quick service. Don't let the long lines stop you. You may wait on line to order, but the food comes out very quickly . I am wondering if the lines will get shorter once the novelty wears off. Bento Cafe has a large two sided menu. The blue side has sushi and poke bowls. The red side has hot food. We have been to Bento Cafe several times and we have tried several items. From the blue side:  Poke Bowl ($8-11) depending on number of proteins)-excellent!  Choose your base (brown or white rice, or salad), choose 1-3 proteins. I have had poke tuna, poke salmon, spicy tuna, smoked salmon...all fresh & delicious!  However there are also other proteins available including plain tuna & salmon, Krab, Tempura Chicken & Shrimp Tempura, Fried Tofu, Eel, & Wahoo. The portions are not huge.  I can  easily finish three proteins. Then choose up to four ""additions"". I have had edamame, tempura flakes, wakame, masago, and avocado. There are many others to choose from including veggies, nuts, etc.  Then choose two sauces out of the nine choices. I love the sweet chili sauce. The spicy mayo is good as well. Overall, the poke bowls are fresh, flavorful, and reasonable. Spicy Tuna Roll-very good!Blue Kawaii Roll-This roll was wrapped in rice paper and lettuce, without rice. It had yellowtail, krab delite, salmon (which I substituted for tuna), avocado, and ponzu sauce... very light, tasty, and refreshing roll!The red side of the menu is where you can order rice or noodle bowls and bento boxes.  The price of each depends on the protein and there are about 17 ways your protein can be prepared. Bento covers several Asian prep styles including Korean, Thai, and Chinese.  You can upgrade all of these to a combo which includes a side (edamame, ginger salad, or miso soup) and a beverage. The miso soup is better than average simply because it is not salty as so many miso soups are. The ginger salad also comes with the bento box. I have had better. The bento box also comes with lo mein (very weak), string beans (very good), and rice. I don't think I would get  the bento box again simply because the salad and lo mein were not very good. For my main dish in the bento box I ordered Tofu Sriracha Garlic. The Tofu was overly fried. The Sriracha sauce was too thick, gooey, and overwhelming. I would not recommend.  I did try 11 year old's Spicy Hunan Steak. This was not fried and had a really nice soy chili garlic sauce with just the right amount of heat.  We also tried the pork dumplings which were a little bland.  Bento also has milk and blended teas. You can choose from all sorts of flavors and add boba, popping boba, or jelly. I tried a pineapple blended tea with boba. It was cool, frosty, tasty, and refreshing!I guess so far I am more impressed with the blue side of the menu, although I look forward to trying more hot dishes from the red side. The Beef Noodle Soup is on my list when I am in the mood for a heartier meal. Bento recently added a second cashier so the lines go faster. The staff is always very pleasant. The servers bring the food to your table. They will bring silverware and water as well and clean the table. Overall, nice option for fast casual Asian food in Davie! Bento has already become a staple in our dining out repertoire"
3/18/2017,3,"Krab ragoons were ok the dipping sauce had nasty after taste AND do not order the monoglian beef...disgusting  noodles were cold..not enough sauce. Had to ask them to put in the microwave. Sushi was on point we ordered the Miami roll, it should have been a sushi only spot. I was so disappointed.  $$ 35.00 foolishly spent on trying a new food spot!I won't be back unless someone begs me."
6/29/2019,5,"I love Bento so much that I wish they have a vip card! My first visit to bento was with a group of girlfriends in Jacksonville. This was before they open up other locations. I always wish they had something like this in Miami. Little did I know, they opened up one in Davie by the town shops. Ever since I found this location, I have been coming here multiple times a month. There is always a long line all the way by the door. This place is always busy but so worth waiting for. Their udon garlic broccoli and shrimp is delicious! So is their beef tawainese soup! But beware, this soup is spicy! The spicy cream chicken is also very tasty. Definitely another dish I recommend trying or their bento box with a variety of salad, protein and carb of your choice. This restaurant is by far one of my favorite Asian fusion restaurants. Now that I found out they are opening a new bento behind my job at Dania Beach pointe plaza. I need a bento credit card!"
7/6/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is the place to go if you want good, affordable, and fast Asian food. It's a quick service restaurant, so you order your food at the counter, pick up your number, and everything gets brought out to your table as it's made. Similar in concept to Pei Wei, but that's as far as the similarities go. Bento is a more upscale spot that is higher in quality and has a menu with a huge variety of options. I'm not really big on raw fish, but I've been here so many times that I've actually tried the entire kitchen menu - this is what happens when I go with friends and family consistently for six months, ha! The kitchen menu has a basic outline: you order your choice of entree and have it served in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. The bento box basically let's you have a variety of food. Everything is separated in different compartments, and it looks super presentable especially if you want to post a picture of what you got. Also, if you don't like one of the items that comes in the box, you can do up to two substitutions at no extra charge with something that already comes in the box. So if you don't like the string beans you can substitute it for more noodles. You get the concept. I typically go for the rice bowls because let's be real, I'm a student and cheap. Out of all the items I've tried, my top five would be the red curry, curry katsu, garlic soy, pineapple thai fried rice, and Korean. I usually get chicken as my protein; honestly I don't like the steak here it's cut up into pieces and automatically well done. I prefer the chicken or tofu. My mom loves the Taiwanese rice noodles here; she says they remind her of this Filipino dish called pancit so she always orders it when she comes. As far as side items go (I say side because they're not guaranteed to come out before your entree) my absolute ride or die is the fried krab wontons. They are to die for especially with the sweet chili sauce they come with. You also get one free sauce per entree and then the ones after that are $0.50 each. I don't eat sushi, but my dad loves the sushi and poke bowls here. Poke bowls are basically sashimi bowls over rice! You have the option to build your own poke bowl or choose from the pre-built options. When you build your own, you choose a base of white rice, brown rice or mixed greens. Then you choose up to three proteins. The pricing is based on the amount of proteins you pick. VERY IMPORTANT TIP: You can't order two of the same protein. You can order three of the same, but not two. The extra dollar that you pay for the second protein is for the variety, but the total amount of protein you get is the same as for the one protein. Yes, I know it's confusing but one of the cashiers nicely explained it to me. You automatically get four additions, one topping, and two sauces on the side. When my dad doesn't build his own, he likes to get the tuna poke bowl or the spicy tuna/salmon don. He's very health conscious so when he orders sushi he likes to get the kawaii rolls, which are wrapped in rice paper and lettuce instead of rice and seaweed. They also offer a HUGE variety of boba teas! They offer milk tea, milk tea smoothies, green teas, blended ices, and Thai tea. You can also combine up to two flavors and they have a list of combo suggestions on the wall as well. I prefer to order the passionfruit green tea or the strawberry mango blended ice. You can get a regular size for $3.50 or a large for $5.00. Pro tip: the boba doesn't automatically come in the tea! It's an add on item. $0.50 for regular tapioca pearls and flavored jellies and $0.75 for popping boba. If you ask the cashiers will let you try the boba and jellies, but you can't try the flavored teas because they are made to order. They also have a boba rewards punch card where if you buy 8 teas, you get one free. The free one is a regular size though so don't expect a large for your free one. The workers bring out the tea to your number as well, so you can sit anywhere you like and they bring it to you. Very convenient!The service is extremely fast here. Food comes out as it's made, so don't expect all your food to come out at once! After eating here so much I tell people that Bento spoils me because every time I go to other places the food comes out too slow and I get super hangry. One time my food came out before I even sat down - it was magical. You get your utensils, napkins, water, and to-go boxes yourself by the soda station and sit wherever you want. The restaurant is usually pretty chilly so bring a jacket or sit in the warmer areas by the back. The workers are pretty chill and are good about keeping everything restocked and clean. Overall, great food, great concept, great design. 10/10 recommend."
12/6/2018,5,"I really like this place.  The service is always great.  The cashiers are always patient and always have answers to my questions.  I've only gotten poke bowls but the other entrees and rolls etc I've seen other people are eating look really good.  This place is always packed.  Line is usually out the door.  Please do not be discouraged!  The workers move very fast!  You won't be waiting long so stick it out!  Be sure to ask for a cup for water, it's complimentary at the soda machine.  But only get water because if you put soda or juice in the water cup you'll be charged!  Lol. Well that's what the sign says."
3/27/2017,4,"Looks like Bento Cafe situates themselves close to college campuses. Smart idea. This is affordable Japanese fast food. I was impressed with the good value. This location was clean, well laid out, brightly lit. It is in a fairly new mall that is very pleasant. Wear a sweater, it was chilly when we went last night (March 26, 2017). Extensive menu - but takes some time to figure it out. More photos might be helpful.The ordering system is somewhat similar to Chipotle, you stand in line to order, except they give you a number stand for your table and deliver your food. Time for delivery was very good and you definitely benefit from them making it up fresh.  I ordered two things I was pleased with. A wok stir fry with tofu in a bento box. The string beans that came separately in the bento box were perfectly cooked. (Note that string beans are one of the few vegetables that supermarkets source locally in Southern Florida) I have posted a photo of it here. Very good value for $11. No extra charge for choosing brown rice. I enjoyed the Hawaii sushi I chose. No rice. Very tasty. (posted photo)My cousin, John, ordered the Hunan bowl with shrimp. He was disappointed. He likes spicy food but he said that spicy was ultimately the only flavor in this dish and it got boring. (posted photo).Ample parking in this mall. Yelp - your choices don't include mall parking. I answered that there is outdoor seating but it is limited."
10/26/2016,3,"My boyfriend and I came to this hot spot because of all the great reviews and because I was dying to try the poke bowl everyone's been raving about. We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. The lines moved quickly and we could still find a cletable to sit at, which was great. My boyfriend ordered the fried tofu with Mongolian sauce over rice. The flavor was excellent but the portion was tiny. There was double the amount of rice that was necessary for the amount of protein he got. I created my own poke bowl and it was fresh and good except for the huge amount of rice as well. We also got a side of fried dumplings that were really overfried. We regretted not getting the steamed ones. Overall not a lot of food for the $30 we spent on lunch. We would've probably preferred to go to a less casual/fast food/trendy place and paid the same amount of money for a little more food. We will come back to try other items maybe, but only if we're already in the area."
10/30/2019,4,"The thing I like most about this place is there are so many different choices and things you can get from the menu so you don't get bored eating same old thing while you're there. I love their bento box which gives you a main item of your choosing, green beans, rice, salad with delicious ginger dressing and lo mein noodles. Their Pao Pao spicy shrimp is so good my mouth is watering just thinking of it. They have some delicious rolls but my favorite roll is their Mex roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce. The different textures and flavors combine for such an amazing taste. They give you generous portions, especially with the rice and noodle bowls. My only complaint is that there was a $5 upcharge to get fried rice instead of white rice which I thought was a little high. Other than that the food is fairly priced.  It gets very busy here during lunch time but the line moves pretty quickly."
11/29/2016,5,"You think your days of college are over. But one thing that just keeps on bringing back the nostalgia of good times. Bento Cafe has slowly been making it's way down to South Florida.  And by goodness, it still brings the food at a reasonable price.  The nostalgia of being at a social club event and going to Bento afterwards has really made the community reminisce of the good times.  The red curry katsu, szechuan noodle soup, and the cream sauce are still as good as ever.  Being by the upcoming Davie Tower Center has really made it's presence felt.This is a place that has staying power.  Enjoy the good fast Asian food. Davie, you're in for a treat!"
8/29/2020,1,Poorly managed. If you order pick up or from uber eats expect your order to be messed up (on multiple occasions in my instance) and management to offer not as much as an apology. I have been a loyal customer since my days at the original Bento in Gainesville but that ended today. Do better Bento.
4/25/2021,1,"Due to the lack of staff and/or ingredients they are not selling rolls, although you can see many of them in the menu... A Japanese restaurant not selling sushi, sashimi and rolls!! Just to complete the experience... they missed my daughter's order."
12/12/2016,3,"It pains me to have to redo my initial review of 5-stars from last week :-(I was so excited to take my beau here for him to experience everything I've been raving about. We grabbed menus and proceeded to order. He got the pork bento box combo. I ordered the poke' bowl as usual. We sat down at the worst table in the place. My honey cannot pick seats anymore. LOL The seat is near the beverage and utensils station. A column pretty much blocks the side of two tables. I would suggest you only sit there if a party of two sitting on opposite sides. We sat near each other and when I wanted to refill my beverage, I found myself sliding down to the other side so as not to disturb his eating (pics available). This is still not the reason for the 3-stars. Why the 3-stars? Well since I had a direct view of the water filling station, I noticed an employee refill her water bottle. She placed the spigot directly into her water bottle. Working in healthcare has me pretty sensitive to these opportunities of contamination. Although the pull lever idea of dispensing water is convenient and trendy, I implore  the owners and management to revisit this method. Until then, guess who won't be having water at this establishment?I wanted to speak with the MOD but my beau was rushing me out the door because we needed to get back home for our puppy. I'll have to ring them instead."
4/24/2021,4,"Food is tasty, nice portions per palate. They offered online ordering service but was not avail unable when I was there. They took too long for the beverages to come."
4/19/2021,4,Hit or miss here. Food is always good but boba smoothies usually limited by flavors and honey boba almost always out by mid afternoon.
2/14/2019,4,Tuna bowl was delish and the staff was so friendly! I can't wait to go back and try more things from their menu !!
10/2/2016,3,"I've stopped into this brand new location 4 times so far- the first time was around dinner time, and the line was really long and I was in a rush so I left and tried to call to order take out while running other errands, but they didn't pick up the phone. At that point they'd only been open a few days so I returned again another day and got some take out and lucked out that there were only a couple people in line so I was in and out in no time. I got the spicy cream tofu rice bowl and it was great. I came back again to order take out for my boyfriend and he enjoyed his dish. I've also tried the boba tea, and it was good but not great. I came again to finally try eating in with a few friends, and while I like the concept, they aren't really equipped yet to handle long lines (they only use 1-2 of their tills even though there are three, and while it seems like one is supposed to be for take out, everyone stands in one line. I lucked out in that most of the line was behind me. However, when I received my dish, it was lukewarm at best, so I think the majority of the items are pre-made and just thrown together and heated for a minute, which while not the worst thing in the work, is really just A-OK. I wouldn't rank this as my favorite, but I can see the appeal, especially with college students. I've been to locations else where and had similar mixed feelings. I wouldn't wait in a super long line for it, but if they weren't busy and I was looking for something fast, I'll probably return."
9/25/2016,5,"I was excited to try this place out so went with my boyfriend for lunch. On a Sunday afternoon the line was long but moved at a decent pace, and gave us time to look over the menu and see what we wanted.  We went with the spicy cream chicken bento box combo with miso soup and the bamboo roll. We took our seats and the food was brought out shortly. Everything was delicious. The sushi was sooo fresh. The spicy cream chicken was so delicious. The bento box came with green beans, lo mein, brown rice, salad and dessert. The salad was lacking but everything else was great. I am so glad to have this place nearby as I can easily see myself ordering soups to go (to take to work for lunch the next day) or just coming in for sushi. It was so fresh. I cant wait to try other things on the menu but it will be difficult deciding whether to order the same thing because it was so amazing or try something else."
8/8/2018,5,"I am so in love with this place! I finally checked this place out one day during lunch when I needed a break from school. I went over and tried their bento bowls. I must say, it's absolutely the best! Not only do you get to pick and choose what you want added to your customized bowl, but everything is fresh and delicious! Definitely worth your money. They give you such a big portion, that you have leftovers for dinner or when you get hungry again when studying. I've come back a couple more times, and can't wait to try out their rolls next time I bring my boyfriend. The place is also very clean, and the service is great. They were patient with me the first time I came here, and answered any questions I had in regards to the menu and the things I could do."
4/13/2021,1,"I will never go to this location again, severely disappointed. I ordered an order for here and waited 25 min, for a poké bowl. When I asked how much longer I was told it was almost done when it wasn't even started. Then when I asked to change it to TO-Go the woman in the window began yelling and complaining. Several others were upset asking for their food as well. Location was clearly overwhelmed with online ordering, perhaps turn it off for an hour to catch up and serve the people dining in."
6/4/2019,4,Today I went here for dinner with my sister and her friends. The lo mein noodles were good. The chicken katsu was very good. It was flakey and the quality of the chicken meat was good. Everyone thought that the chicken katsu tasted like chicken nuggets.
7/23/2018,4,"I've been here, at the Tower Shoppes, a couple of times; right after Hurricane Irma, and then more recently with my little girl. They offer a variety of choices with boxes, bowls and rolls, and they have boba teas. On this visit, we ordered a box and a bowl. My daughter's lo mein noodle bowl with orange chicken was delicious. She also ordered the boba tea, which she hated, and I don't blame her. I guess it's not our thing! I had the box with brown rice, string beans, lo mein and ginger salad. Everything was hot & fresh. The place was neat, including the Ladies Room, and the customer service was good. The ambiance is quiet, but that was perfect, as we wanted to just sit next to each other and catch up on the week's activities. Would I recommend it, Yes!"
5/29/2020,1,"Staplers must be hard to find since that could be your ""alternative"" method to securing and tamper proofing a bag. Maybe you should call your local McDonald's or Latin American grill to find out where they get there stapler from."
12/15/2016,5,"I went to Bento Cafe with five other people and absolutely loved it! This restaurant itself has a solid amount of seating and you order at the counter and then sit anywhere you like. There are many options from rice and noodle bowls to sushi and even poke bowls. Most people in my group got either a rice or noodle bowl, which was very delicious. I got the shrimp bowl with udon noodles and the spicy cream sauce, which I highly recommend. I do think they could have added more sauce as it was not enough for the amount of udon noodles they gave. We also got the sushi box combo with the Mt Fuji roll to share which was good but nothing special. One person in my group got the bento box which was surprisingly very large and difficult to finish. I also got a bubble tea which was average. Overall: Really great food and very filling for a solid price."
8/21/2018,5,"We travel to south Florida quite often, and we always visit Bento Cafe for lunch. And always had a great experience!The first time we stumbled here while looking for a bubble tea place. And Bento Cafe serves a pretty darn good bubble tea! Tapioca is always fresh and soft, they have a variety of flavors. Ordered many different ones and always enjoyed it. It's a fast food type place for Asian fusion fans, but no matter how long the line is to order, your food arrives fast and fresh. We never had issues with bad flavor or ill looking dishes. We have tried their sushi, bento boxes, noodles dishes - everything is flavorful and just like you ordered. Their staff is courteous and always helpful. Overall, it's a great Asian fusion place, we have returned time after time, and were never disappointed."
1/21/2018,5,"Great for Poke bowls! You can make your own poke rice bowl, choosing from a lot of different toppings. It makes it really fun to customize what you want. Recommend the spicy tuna, it is really good with some avocado and masago.The boba is too sweet though, and you can not customize the sugar."
2/24/2019,5,"Love the food here, and the price is so reasonable! And the sushi is fresh. Great for lunch but they are usually pretty busy so you'll need some patients."
2/24/2020,3,Ok. My friends chicken Katsu was way overdone and patchy burnt. His wife's and My bowl was good though. I guess you need to make sure to tell them to katsu with caution
8/28/2018,4,Love this place!! They have many options and everything is extremely tasteful. You'll always always leave full. I just wish they had more Gluten Free options.
8/28/2018,4,"One of the newer places in the Tower Shops, it is trendy and has decent food. They have a good menu with sushi, poke bowls, noodle and rice bowls, and bento boxes. I had shrimp pad Thai and the kid had some broccoli and steak bowl. Both were really tasty. The Pad Thai had a nice amount of spice to it. I saw they had boba teas and a pick up area for take out. The line to order got long but was quickly handled and our food came out relatively fast.  It's a nice atmosphere inside. I'd come back and try another dish."
3/15/2019,4,"Last minute dinner date with kids. My son said ""let's try a new Asian place "". Well great choice,!! Affordable , quick service, attentive helpful staff and yes good was on point.  Will definitely recommend and come again."
4/21/2019,5,"Best Pan Asian cuisine! Their food is always served fresh and their price is unbeatable! Love all of their food, especially the Korean chicken Udon noodle bowl!"
7/8/2018,5,"This place is fast food meets bento with speed and quality. Really enjoy going here. Food tastes great and it is served quick. I've had their sushi, bento and soups. Everything is a winner."
3/3/2020,4,"We went on a Sunday afternoon and not crowded, which probably helped with waiting only a short period of time to get our food. All three of our Thai dishes were delicious. The only downside to my Pad Thai dish was that it had a minimal amount of vegetables and meat. Unfortunately, the air conditioning was too cold and all three of us got a bit chilled."
10/31/2019,5,This please has great fresh food and great staff! Food gets brought to the table FAST and is always fresh. I love the Poke bowls and sushi! The Thai fried rice is great also! The only knock I can give this place is that the Bubble tea is too sweet for me and they can't make it less sweet. But overall I'm very happy with this place!
5/28/2020,5,I love this place- good food and inexpensive. My kids love the chicken fried rice and I love their bamboo roll! Highly recommended
12/3/2019,4,"Stopped in for lunch here since I was in the mood to try something new. I tried both the Wok chicken friend rice and a Lo Mein noodle bowl. I enjoyed both especially the Lo Mein noddle bowl, but nothing really distinguishes it from other choices in the area. The staff was all polite, the location was clean, and the service was extremely quick. They have plenty of parking since it's in a shopping center with other restaurant nearby. I will be back to try their other selections and update my review if any are notable mentions."
11/25/2016,3,"Waited until my 2nd visit to review. This visit was a big improvement. My tips: order online in advance,  avoid the ginger salad and go for a poke bowl.  Had a poke bowl with brown rice, salmon & spicy tuna. it was very good and fresh. Service was also better. Still had to wait,  but there were 2 cashiers this time and got food pretty quickly. Last time I came with my husband,  we waited about 25 min before ordering, then waited quite a bit for our food.  Also got our food at different times... as in, I was almost done when my husband's food got to the table.  I think the servers just bring out whatever is ready as soon as it comes out, so the timing could be better  The bento boxes were ok, although the ginger salad was a shredded mess."
10/3/2016,5,"First time trying this place, went with a friend it was recommended by her roommate. Enormous menu! Asian on one side, sushi on the other. Everything was so fresh, only thing is all the food does not come at the same time. It took kind of long, it was 1230 lunch rush definitely and they're short staffed. We ordered the garlic edamame regular size (it's a rather small portion), the Kuwaii roll (most popular one) and we made Poke Bowls which allow you to pick 3 proteins 4 add-ins and 2 sauces with rice or lettuce. EVERYTHING WAS SO FRESH AND DELICIOUS. I definitely want to come back asap to try their Asian menu."
5/21/2018,5,"Bento cafe is one of my favorite local options for quick take home dinners. I'm sure you can call ahead but I always just show up and place my orders to go and even on this last visit when I walked in with the line ending basically at the door, after placing my order I still waited less than 10 minutes. I've tried their rice bowls, sushi and poke bowls and have found them all to be pretty good. This most recent visit I ordered a honeydew boba tea, spring rolls, ginger scallion bowl with shrimp for my mom and a build your own poke bowl on mixed greens with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, krab and a million toppings. All of it came out in a timely manner prepared nicely and with good flavoring. I will continue to come here when I'm in the mood for something flavorful and quick."
7/27/2018,5,The poke bowl was really yummy and the sushi was good also. My daughter had the kids chicken teriyaki with noodles and she liked it. Will definitely go back.
1/24/2019,5,So I saw this place randomly when googling for a place to eat. It's nice and clean. Got my food to go. Was good and a lot of food! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
4/6/2018,5,"Kind of a chipotle or Pei Wei style service. The food is great and pretty quick. The long lines tell you how good it is. Love that I can get a poke bowl quickly. They have tons of other Asian food options like miso soups, sushi, poke bowls, Asian teas and sodas, etc. Would definitely recommend"
11/27/2018,4,"We love it here:  variety, quick, & a good value.   The only issue we had tonight was with the sauces.  Why limit 1 sauce per entree?   I ordered 2 then went to go sit down while my husband placed his order.   The cashier said that he couldn't have a sauce because I had already taken his share (she never told me I was taking his).   Then she told him about the new policy, and wanted to charge him for his sauce.   She didn't seem to understand that when you are enforcing policies, you need to be clear and up front in the beginning...why was my husband getting the runaround, but I was handed 2 sauces with no explanation.  So strange since we are there weekly and have never had issues.   Weird!"
2/11/2021,1,Waiting for an order that THEY LOST now have to wait an extra 20mins for THEIR incompetence. Worst customer service very degrading to women. I watched as any attractive woman that came in as they walked out the boys would whisper and jeer. Don't come here all creepy.
8/20/2018,2,"Stay away from the Pad Thai if you love authentic Pad Thai from Thai restaurants owned by Thai people. The Pad Thai from this place has a very strong sour and peanuty flavor which I did not expect at all. The flavor also had a medium heat and the chicken breast meat was very tender.The yuzu slush was tart but had an authentic yuzu flavor. However, I expected it to be sweeter like the yuzu juice that used to be served on Japan Airlines.Since this was my very first meal here, I can't say that I hate or love this place yet. I'll give this place a few more chances with other dishes before I decide."
3/30/2019,5,Parking sucks during lunch hour!!! You don't have to wait in a super long line if you already place your order over the phone. They provide a lot of meat and it was very fulling
2/2/2019,5,"Yesterday was my first time dining at Bento :)Great spot for lunch or dinner!Absolutely Amazing Food with so many options!Overall good dining space, also if dining in they give you a ticket number and bring your order out fresh to your table. Pretty fast too! I hope there will be more locations other than Davie, FL ! I recommend opening one in Aventura :)"
5/18/2018,4,"I remember the first time I went to bento cafe in Gainesville for DTJ. My first order was a chicken teriyaki which is still what I order today. It's a fast casual dining place that has sushi and kitchen style food. It's a little pricey but not too much. This location on University drive  looks different than the ones in Orlando and Gainesville but it's not a bad thing. The food tastes the same as the other locations. How it works if you've never been is you go up to the cashier and order what you want and a food runner will bring it to you at your table with a number that is given when you order. I ordered a chicken teriyaki again today along with a new bowl I haven't tried, the beef bulgogi with rice bowl. Chicken teriyaki  was good it's my go to for this place. The Korean  beef bulgogi is a spicy dish but I thought it was more mild spicy than actually spicy. Much like the chicken teriyaki, it also comes with string beans. My girlfriend ordered  a bento box of chicken Katsu and she was surprised at the amount of food given. Overall we were overly satisfied with this location and the food offered. 100%+++++recommend!!!!Great place for small groups of friends or family"
9/25/2016,5,I am so glad this place is right across the street from my home! This place is amazingly delicious! With really healthy choices.The bento boxes are so worth the money! I am dying to try the pork but since they are new there shipment are a little off. Pros delicious healthy food.. really friendly staff!And you can call in your orders ahead !Cons NONE
4/25/2018,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  Food is good, my go-to order is either a bowl with rice and teriyaki chicken or udon noodles and chicken katsu.  I love their udon.  I personally skip the barbecue sauce they give you with the chicken, I put teriyaki sauce on the noodles, and dip the chicken in spicy mayo.  Their spicy mayo is awesome.  Most of the times, the service is fairly quick and I'm content when I leave.  However, I'm occasionally faced with poor customer service.I recently ordered in advance for pickup.  When I walked in, I passed the normal line and went straight to the pickup register, where a girl ignored me.  I asked her if I was in the right place, and she said no, I had to wait in the line that went out the door.  A little hesitant on my short lunch break, I waited thirty minutes in that line because she told me to.  When it was my turn, a different girl told me to walk up to the pickup window because I didn't have to wait in line. What!!! I asked the girl who originally made me wait why she told me I couldn't just pick up my food.  She looked at me for a second, then turned her back and walked away.  I had seen her a couple other times after this visit and she wasn't very pleasant.  A manager was helpful in assisting me with this incident, so I have returned since then.  Bento - good food, mostly pleasant, fair price"
6/11/2019,5,"Bento will forever be in my college memories. This place is honestly great. I always get the sushi and I have never had a complaint honestly it's great food. I'm actually craving it as we speak lol. The Caliente Roll is my favorite one! The Special Mexican Roll is also delicious and I will forever recommend them. The bento boxes are also delicious and the salad that comes with them has a really tasty dressing on it. Staff is friendly, my only complaint is that sometimes when I order sushi it seems like the kitchen forgot about me but I always get my food eventually, can't blame them if they're super busy!"
10/19/2019,3,I am so sad. I've been obsessed with bento for years! When I would go to Orlando it's a must at least once a day. I've been going to the davie location since it opened. I haven't been since the summer since life got crazy but.... what in the world happened???!!!!!! The whole place felt different! The employees (young boys with crazy attitudes) looked so bored and annoyed. I wish it ended there. Then the food came...... what have you guys done!  everything was off point. The kids Katsu box portion was cut way down. My sons chicken was rock solid. The wonton chips now have a cinnamon thing and they tasted about 2 months old. My pao pao chicken was 50% fat and the lo mein that comes with my box was so cold and old tasting. My box portion also went down. This is the first time I've ever been let down by bentos. Ever in probably 8+ years!!! Please go back to how it used to be
6/26/2018,5,Bento is amazing! I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and it was so flavorful. I love that they have many vegetarian options! I used to eat here back in college in another location so I was getting all the nostalgia vibes. The pad Thai has not changed at all! I also loved how for Father's Day they give your father a free meal which is very nice! It was also very clean and centrally locates. Staff was helpful with all my questions from my family too!
6/5/2018,5,Sooo good! Great food and service. The food got to me quicker then I ordered. PLENTY of options. so it's perfect for those picky eaters or fit freaks in the group. Depending on what you order the portions are huge and every order includes like 5 sides and a sauce. one of my favorite Asian shots in the area.
1/2/2021,5,Amazing Poke Bowls. Great atmosphere. Loved every minute of it and the prices are good.
7/27/2018,5,"Whenever I am out shopping or looking for a place to eat after class, my first choice would usually be Bento! I love ordering either the Japanese Curry Chicken Katsu or the spicy creamy shrimp with noodles. For me, it has been difficult to find a place where Japanese Curry Chicken Katsu is both available and good! Besides ordering food, they also have bubble tea that is very good! However, plan your trip to Bento's carefully because they can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner time."
9/25/2019,5,Love this place. Always get the spicy cream chicken (the name is something different now). Only ate in once and it was decent. The food is what gets it 5 stars!
12/12/2017,2,"Bento smells amazing when walking by & is nicely decorated. This is the main reason we decided to eat here out of all the other options in the plaza. The line was super long but went by extremely fast. I was very impressed with all of the menu options (bento boxes have always had a special place in my heart) and of course the prices!I went with the red curry chicken bento. My mother had the yellow chicken rice bowl. Food comes out as it's ready. I received mine first & immediately unimpressed. My bento box was disappointing to say the least. Rice was under cooked, salad was soggy from too much dressing & tasted like freezer burn. The noodles were extremely dry & had absolutely no flavor. I was trying to enjoy the most edible thing in the box (red curry chicken) until my mom took her first bite & made a weird noise. I looked over as she spit out her chicken into a napkin & we both saw that it was completely raw. At that point, it wasn't even worth having them remake it....this place is what it is. The prices are very affordable for a reason. Food quality is very poor. I don't know how anyone could enjoy sushi from here. Sounds like a big risk to me. I like the concept but I just don't see myself trying another thing on the menu & being satisfied."
2/14/2019,1,My last few visits were a real downer.  Today when I arrived the restaurant had less than 10 tables occupied out of maybe 40 tables.I wanted to order sushi but since the staff was all working on a catering order for sushi the wait to order anything sushi related had over a half an hour wait.   If you order anything else off the menu that was non-sushi related you could have it in 5 minutes or less.I think I will take this place off my list...  No fast food sushi place is worth a half hour wait.  Sorry Bento...
12/21/2018,5,Best place to eat at. This is like my 4 time here and every time i eat here it's amazing the food is always warm. And no matter how packed the place is you don't wait more than 10 mins for your food really recommend this place
12/4/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is one of those lunch spots you can always count on to have awesome food.  Although I haven't tried much of the menu from my visits at this location, I always find myself coming back to the spicy cream chicken bento box combo! It comes out perfect every time! The quality and quantity of the food you get is definitely worth the price, sometimes I like to split half for dining in and then taking the other half to go.  Just a quick heads up though, the lunch hour rush is serious and get quite busy at this location, therefore the line can be really long and wrap around the restaurant."
11/26/2017,5,"I have always enjoyed bento boxes and really enjoyed their sushi options.  You place your order and they give you a number and bring the food to the table.  The staff is super friendly and there are a ton of different options.  The staff will also come around and pick up your trays when you are finished,"
1/12/2018,2,"I have heard nothing but high recommendations so I decided to give it a try. The line never got short yet it wasn't a long wait at all. The menu was overwhelming but in a good way. I ordered a custom bento bowl. Let me tell you, it was so delicious! I also ordered some seaweed salad and that was excellent too. Staff was super friendly. Hard to find a table. Super disappointed my last bite of salmon was rather large that's why I saved it for last. In the midst of chewing felt something sharp. I spit it out and there it was a huge bone not taken out. I was so scared because this could have cut my throat. This ruined the visit for me. Otherwise food tasted good. Scared minor details are being over looked in the food preparation since it's such a busy restaurant."
12/6/2018,4,"This place is great for quick and great food. We ordered 2 items and food was on table within few minutes. We ordered rice bowl with Veggie stir fry, pineapple fried rice and Thai iced tea. Loved the pineapple fried rice with tofu but rice bowl was ok."
3/30/2018,5,Bentos is one of my go to places! Service is always great and the poke bowl is so yummy! My favorite sauce to eat it with the poke bowl is spicy kobachi !
12/5/2018,4,Love this place for variety and quality! They never disappoint. Almost every thing that i have had here delivers and hits the spot. Thai tea is not as good though. I have had better at other places.
5/27/2018,4,"The first time I tried Bento was about a year ago. I have been back several times and each time the food and service has been great. If you enjoy a hip casual atmosphere and yummy Asian Cuisine, you should definitely give them a try. There is usually a line to order when you walk in, unless you get lucky or go at an off time like we did today. I recommend going for a late lunch or early dinner or just call ahead if you want to skip the line. The food is totally worth the wait though, and usually comes out pretty quick.The menu is double sided. One side features Sushi & Poke Bowls and the other features A variety of hot dishes from Stir Fry to Beef Soup. I have ordered from both sides of their menu and enjoyed a variety of Asian cuisine here. My favorites include the Vegetable Stir Fry with chicken or shrimp, and the Special Mexican Roll.Whatever Asian food you're in the mood for, Bento definitely delivers in a fun & friendly eatery."
6/16/2018,5,"I went to Bento earlier this week and was thoroughly impressed! I got a poke bowl with salmon, spicy salmon, avocado, spicy mayo, and other toppings. It was outstanding and very reasonably priced! They also have super cute Japanese bottled sodas and great boba!"
7/12/2018,2,"I ordered the ginger and scallion rice bowl that was supposed to come with red bell pepper, onion and snap peas. I didn't know I was going to get half of an onion, 3 slices of red bell pepper and 4 over cooked snap peas. Definitely disappointed in the bowl."
8/8/2017,4,"I really wish more places like this were around this area when I was going to college here. This place blows the cafeteria on campus out of the water.The place is pretty nice from what I could see. Definitely a high traffic restaurant and the parking situation is a bit hectic, so don't expect to be in and out on time during lunch. But the staff here does step up to keep the line moving a take your order quickly. Even took the time to explain the dishes since I was new to the place. I ordered the bento box with Mongolian beef and brown rice. Nice and tender but a bit heavy on the onions. The miso soup was good but very salty. Had to give up on it and finish the veggies.Overall, it is a decent and fun place to hang out and have a bite. I can see myself coming back here and trying some of the other dishes. Give it a shot. :)"
11/27/2017,3,"It was late and I was tired from a long journey. When I looked at the menu, for ""build your own bowl or drink"", there were hundreds of decisions need to be made . I was hungry and tired, would rather not to think too much. So I got a steak udon.  It tasted OK. The poke we had was also average. The service was quick and friendly. The ambuience looked modern but some of the tables were left unclean. The pricing wasn't particular cheap, the portion wasn't that big, the tasted of the food wasn't standing out. Overall, it was just an average experience."
1/5/2018,4,"Not bad, i would recommend this place if you are on the go since food is ready so fast and if you are not looking for anything too fancy"
8/24/2017,5,Bento Cafe is really nice. I got there around 11:00 am when they opened and a line had already started to form. I ordered the veggie roll and the Mexican roll. It was really good and fresh. The place is very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful.
5/16/2017,3,"I always see lines out the door of this place when I go to Trader Joe's so I finally decided to check it out. I ordered a poke bowl and added 2 extra proteins for $12. The bowl was good, not excellent and the quality of the tuna was decent. Prices are really check and the quality was ok. I can see this place being a trend for young Nova student's or families on a budget. I most likely will not be returning, but it was definitely worth trying out. Although, I may stop in next time for a bubble tea !"
1/12/2020,1,"Freaking sucks, they have never gotten my order right. They have given me a free meal multiple times but still somehow end up spend $25 on one meal. They always say they have something, but I do not receive it or its completely wrong. I went to get lunch again after they have been opened for 3 hours.... and they dont have udon noodles.... how is that possible thats as cheap as white rice. They have the worst management and the worst people working. Do not recommend!!!!!"
11/14/2020,1,"90 minutes later and we still haven't received our order from Grubhub.  Their driver's been waiting at the restraint for the last 40 minutes and they first told him the order would be ready in 10 minutes, which he texted me, and then later they told him they were out of one of the items I ordered but were trying to reach me on their iPad!  WTF!!!  The driver called me and handed the restaurant the phone to edit my order and they are now cooking the food.  Regardless of how good the food is the 2 hour wait for delivery and the dishonest staff will forever earn them a 1 star in my book!  Future diners beware..."
3/30/2018,5,I inhaled my food and not only because I was hungry but because it was so good! What I got was the flying dragon roll and shrimp fried rice. All of it worth the drive and fair on the price
6/18/2020,1,"My husband and I went here on Thursday June 18 and we were excited to finally get out and have a meal here. Upon arrival, the table that we sat at wasn't cleaned but we over looked that, but as we sat waiting for our food to come I went up to buy a drink and the cashier who wearing gloves said cards only we aren't accepting cash ,  then proceeds to touch my cups. As we sat eating and waiting for our other food we started noticing the small things like the server who brings out the food cleaned a table with a very dirty looking rag and never changing his gloves and give other people food and we noticed all of them had the same gloves . We spoke to the manager and she was apologetic but told us they change their gloves every 15 min  and only when they change tasks , well they ALL changed tasks the whole time we were there and did NOT change their gloves! When others people left ,the tables stayed dirty . I know you have to stay on top of the cleaning with the new rules and this establishment did not!  I would hope they realize that any one coming in could be sent there just to monitor how and if they are compliant with the new health care laws. Very disappointing! Clean up your act before you get closed down."
7/15/2018,5,Amazing food !! Definitely recommend the poke bowls and Pad Thai. Bento is for sure one of my favorite restaurants. Very good prices and great service.
7/28/2019,5,"I love this place for lunch! It's usually quite busy during lunch time but somehow the lines goes quickly and the food comes out even quicker. The best part is that the food is delicious and well made. I normally order a bento box which you can choose a protein like Mongolian beef or chicken etc. I've tried the Mongolian need and the chicken teriyaki. Both delicious! Along with that comes a little salad, some noodles, a little desert treat, a veggie like string beans and rice. It honestly is the best lunch meal. It's not an overwhelming amount of food but it's also enough to keep you full and satisfied. They also have boba tea with tapioca or boba. The price is not ridiculous either! I highly recommend you to try it out. You won't be disappointed."
1/18/2018,3,"Bento is a great Asian concept that offers fast-food like dining with traditional Asian plates plus sushi.  I feel the pricing is just right and I like the fact that they bring the food to your table.  The food quality here is above average for what it is and you can modify just about any plate on the menu.  Now word of warning to vegetarians and vegans:  even though tofu is offered, it will be fried in the same oil as meat so please keep that in mind as it is no longer considered an option (I wanted to thank the cashier for being honest about it)  There are salads and sushi options for vegetarians and vegans but it will be limited.  All in all a great little spot for a rather quick bite that should leave you happy."
7/11/2017,4,"I usually go here after classes or during lunch because it is close by. Every single time I get Spicy cream chicken with mini udon and I always love it. This place can be very packed during lunch time so make sure to plan your trip accordingly. I generally like the food here but sometimes it can be a hit or miss. My friend and I went here for lunch one time and she ordered korean beef with rice and the rice was raw. We had it sent back and she got a replacement of her food but they were being a little difficult. I think it was just that day that the service was not very friendly. But in general though the staff is friendly and I enjoy the food. The price is in the medium range, a bowl can cost about $10 dollars. They definitely have a good variety to choose from which is a plus for me."
6/25/2018,5,Great concept good good and portions nice ambiance and food choices. The bento box choices are superb. Clean restaurant wish there was one in Coral Springs or coconut creek
9/1/2017,5,"Watch out Pei Wei! This place deserves 5 stars as I have never imagined I could get a curry fix from a fast food place. For only $8 you get a very well portioned bowl with your choice of white rice, brown rice, or noodles. You also can choose your choice of protein and boy oh boy you get quite the selection. This time around I chose the Red Curry with chicken and brown rice. If you're a fan of spicy curry dishes I would highly suggest it."
7/20/2017,5,"This place is great. Been here twice since the first time. Many interesting beverage options that I thoroughly enjoy and their bento box is a nice variety, pretty big and filling. Great lunch/quick dinner place"
3/6/2017,4,"I'm not even going to lie, I'm a Pei Wei loyalist. Bento is however, much nicer interior and so much cleaner and sophisticated I feel like. Idk if its because this location is super brand new.Plenty of free parking because its in a big shopping plaza next to halal guys etc.Bento just might have slightly bigger portions or bigger plates idk lol. Great service. Staff was on top and good on follow up. Price range more or less the same.Ordered Mongolian beef here and it was served very freshly hot. Taste is ehhh I think Pei Wei mongolian beef is definitely way better and sweeter.Bentos crab rangoons were almost the same as Pei weis but Bentos is thickerIf there is anything I do recommend here is their spicy chicken with cream sauce or something. That shit was delicious.Oh and their white rice is very different here.Over all pretty good"
8/31/2017,5,"Really glad we finally have a Bento in South Florida! Used to eat at Bento with friends all the time in Orlando when I attended UCF. This location is really clean, quick service, and has awesome customer service. I would go in to detail about how delicious the food is here.. but just come out here and explore the food for yourself.I recommend spicy cream chicken rice bowl, Miami roll, and the steak is usually good here too! If you're in the mood for a slush.. ask for a passion fruit & lychee mix (I personally don't like Boba, so I get it w/o it... deeelish)."
1/1/2021,1,Took way to long for food to come out. I got my food after waiting 45 minutes my daughter did not get her food which all she ordered was a simple avocado roll. I WAS DONE WITH MY FOOD before hers even came out.Very bad service they DO NOT know how to serve.
9/17/2017,4,"I've been here twice and each time it was very crowded and I was in a rush so I couldn't stay and eat. The plaza this restaurant is located in is very busy and hectic to get in and out of. Add that to the fact that they are in close proximity to three college campuses and you get a very crowded restaurant. That's really my only negative and if I were being completely honest, it's really just a nitpick. The concept isn't original, but it's one that I love and I'm happy to see catching on. The service is really good as the food gets to you pretty fast. I tried the boba tea the first time I was here and loved it. The second time I tried the sriracha garlic chicken with udon noodles and now I'm officially hooked. I also apperciate that they give you the option to substitute tofu for any of the meats in their dishes since that means I'll be able to bring my vegan friend next time."
12/29/2017,3,"I had pickup so I can't really speak much on the dine in experience but I got a Korean shrimp bowl with an almond milk tea smoothie. The bowl was pretty uneventful. Not at all spicy and it was just... lacking something. The boba tea was good but that wasn't what I came there for! The ambience is very nice, the environment was buzzing. Seems like a nice place to sit down and eat so I'll probably go back and give them another go but try something different."
5/14/2017,4,"MmmMm Bentos! The taste of Asian Cuisine with variety of sushi rolls, noodles to rice entrees and delicious sides. Oh yea! Can't forget the Sweet Boba Teas. They have a modern look decor going on with plenty of table spaces for dining. It is seat at your own risk, so if you have a large group I suggest that someone from your group save that spot prior to ordering. The menu has 2 sides, sushi side and an entree side. It can be a bit confusing of how to order but the easy instructions up top the menu has the 1-2-3. So it can't be that hard :0)The dish I always get is the spicy cream chicken OR spicy cream shrimp with brown rice. I alternate here and there but these are my go to dishes. The spicy cream is not that hot; it has the spicy mayo base taste. Love love love it! The dish is balanced with a side of green beans. I tried to make the veggie at home but it was not the same at all. This had a crunch to it as you chew it and saltiness balanced the entree. A great Boba Tea to get us the Thai Ice tea. You can never go wrong with that! When never we make a family trip to Bentos, it's always an exciting treat for all of us!"
11/22/2020,3,Food was alright. I liked the atmosphere and customer service was good. The kitchen was clean and service was speedy. Thanks!
8/19/2020,2,I usually have a 5 star experience with bento but this was the first time I had issues. My wife's friend placed an online order at 5:50 pm and when I got there at 6:15 they couldn't find the order. We placed about an 80 dollar order and there seemed to be some confusion regarding the order once I got there. They couldn't find the name and just came back and said if it was under someone else. I showed them the screen shot of the order items and that the card was charged and I waited some more. Around 6:30 went and went back in again to see if they figured out the status of the order. They said the order scheduled for 6:40 pick up. I confirmed with my friend and it showed ASAP. Finally got the order almost an hour later while many of the people who placed their orders while I was waiting received theirs. Finally get home and there was some things missing and had to call them and drive back to pick it up. They're usually great I've been going since they've been in Gville and Orlando. First time I had an issue and usual have great experience but today was not good.
2/18/2018,5,"Crazy obsessed with Bento. It's an order and they bring your food to you environment. Every time I have gone, the service has been fast throughout the whole process. I'd say every time my food is at my table within 6 minutes or so. They are like ninjas at Bento while at the same time the food is phenomenal. There are many menu option from wok, to sushi, and poke bowls. You can also customize pretty much any meal you choose! Get the bubble tea too!"
2/2/2017,5,"I have been obsessed with Bento Cafe for years in Orlando. Every time I visited I had to go! I was thrilled to find out another location popped up and not too far away from me!This location is set up differently, with a quick service feel. i went during lunch and the line was massive! but trust me it's worth the wait!My go to has always been the SPICY CREAM CHICKEN omg it's amazing! Not too spicy and you can make it hotter if you want to. I usually go for the bento box which will give you rice, noodles, string beans and a little dessert. But I opted for the kids meal which is the spicy cream chicken, rice and string beans just a smaller portion. Then I wanted to try one of their sushi rolls and I was thrilled to find out they had boba! That milk tea with the boba inside is sooo yummy nice little treat!You order at the counter, the staff is nice and helpful then you get a number to put on your table. It didn't take too long to get the food delivered to your table. The food here is amazing! The spicy cream sauce is so tasty, I could put it on everything. The chicken is in small bites, not greasy or fatty at all. The cook their string beans with various spices so it really makes having your veggies enjoyable! I opted for the brown rice to make myself feel like I was balancing out the sweet boba tea. I went for a spicy crunch sushi roll to stay with a similar theme of the chicken. It was a good sized portion and lots of crunch sprinkles!Overall I had a great lunch and look forward to coming back again soon!"
7/11/2017,4,"What a great place.     First, it's large inside..didn't expect that when walking in.  Really nice modern decor.   My wife and I split two entrees..a poke bowl for spicy tuna and a roll that had no rice.   Everything was very very fresh.    2 days later I found myself wanting another 'poke' bowl.   So good and felt 'clean' (eating).   I just wish there was one closer to CS / Parkland area.    Maybe one day!"
8/18/2017,3,"Inexpensive, which is great. But the food is low quality. The sushi is not fresh and the noodles were undercooked. Bubble tea was good though."
11/15/2019,1,Rude ass manager MJ (mahali) was rude over some damn ginger ale this place doesn't let you customize your food either which i don't get even if you offer to pay additional Gave this place another try and it's just not it the guy who made my slushie went from cleaning straight to making my slushie without washing his hands and he was right by a sink i had to tell him wash his hands he didn't know i was watching they are unsanitary
9/23/2019,3,"So I went here with my friends for dinner the other night. The place itself is nice and clean. It was pretty packed when we went. However, the food was very basic. I got sushi and it wasn't all that tasteful. I only rated this 3 star based on the food taste otherwise the customer service was very good. They replaced my food for me because I had ordered uncooked salmon by mistake. But will I return here again? Probably not."
6/17/2018,5,This is my first time eating here! My daughter told me she would go to the Gainesville location back in college so I decided why not for Fathers Day. It wasn't packed which was great since I didn't want to wait for hours to sit down at a restaurant. Ordered a tofu sirarcha noodle and it was the best tofu meal I've ever had! Definitely will be back for more.
9/14/2017,1,"I visited the day before hurricane Irma came, as they were one of the few places to be open. Tried their cucumber avocado roll, it's was delicious! Went back to get the same thing after the hurricane, and I don't know if the food had gone spoiled without them knowing during the hurricane, but unfortunately I got food poisoning from the roll. I'm okay now, still recovering, probably won't go back though."
3/7/2017,4,"I have been the Bento is Gainesville, two of the locations in Orlando, and now this one in South Florida. For the most part, they were all pretty consistent with the taste and look of their  food.  The front of the house and food runners were all super friendly and quick.  When you come in you grab a menu and take a look at what you would like, then you go to the registers and order. They give you a number that you bring with you to the table when you sit. The drink fountain is towards the back along with silverware and napkins that you can get yourself.My sister had two strands of hair that were inside of the spicy cream chicken she ordered. We notified one of the employees passing by and he quickly went to get who I believe was a manager. She took care of the situation very quickly and gave her some edamame while she waited for them to remake her food.  Other than that situation, the rest of our food was great. My favorites from Bento are definitely the spicy cream chicken, red curry katsu, and their whole sushi menu.Great place to come with friends!"
12/9/2017,3,"Disappointed.. food is somewhat cold not that great very commercial. They sweep while customers are eating and there's also flies. :( On the positive note if you don't care about the latter, the line goes by fast and the service is great."
1/3/2017,5,"This is the place to go for quick fresh sushi on a quick lunch run. Trendy and clean in design and gives you the option to go for bowls, rolls or sashimi platters. It's conveniently located in Plantation Town Center shops and parking is convenient. Large seating areas either tables, long booths or by the sushi bar. Very quick service and friendly staff that brings orders to your tables. And the sushi is of course super fresh and delicious. My reason for making this place my favorite lunch stop for sushi."
10/24/2019,4,"Very good tasting sushi! I had the Flying dragon and a Cali roll. I love how you can customize things. I rate it a 4 because there was no ice in the vending machine and had to drink a room temperature water. But I would come back, great service."
6/5/2017,5,"I have to say this is a new all time favorite for some nice, quick, and delicious food.I went on Saturday and it was packed, but enough space where 8 of us where able to find a table. I went for dinner, so I am not sure how it gets during lunch.It does get full, but I went around 8pm and was able to find seating.Food: the food here is pretty good, I had the Sushi combo box, which allows you to grab two different 4 pieces, and 8 piece California roll; this comes along with some wakame seaweed and imitation crab. I also ordered the garlic edamame and they were also pretty good. I had family members that had the Poke bowl, Udon soup, and the Taiwanese rice noodles, and they mentioned it was pretty good as well.Price: the price range was not bad for what you get, $10 for 16 pieces was not bad, the edamame was a bit pricey for me, but it tasted good.The prices of the other items are not bad, because they do not cheat you out of portioning.The sushi is a bit small, but still very filling and delicious.Environment: the service is great, they will bring the food to you, they did take a big longer than usual to bring us our food, and the lady couldn't find us, but nothing outrageous. the restaurant is actually very spacious, and even though it gets packed, you do not feel as if you were cramped in there.Overall, this is a new favorite that I cannot wait to go back to.The price is right, the the food is good, and it is overall a nice place to enjoy."
3/30/2017,5,I'm a poke bowl conesueir. I found this spot a few months ago. Now everyone and their mom goes. It never disappoints. Fast friendly service and delicious food. Will be back again and again! Great prices!
7/22/2017,4,"Delicious. Tried something different each time and every time it's been very tasty. Tried noodle bowls, poke bowls, bento boxes, and sushi plates and all are good. Not 5 stars because the order takers/servers are pretty cold and have no personality....very impersonal. Kind of pricey too for lunch. But definitely going to be a regular place for us."
12/19/2016,5,"Bento has always been one of my favorites in college and I am so happy it is now in Broward. I can't wait until they expand more all over so I can eat it everyday. I will never get sick of the sushi and hot food for an affordable price. The ambiance and staff is well trained, quick and always ready. There's always a line out the door when I go though, but that's how good it is. It's relatively quick though."
2/1/2018,5,Its a cool little spot. Well lit. Pretty busy. The food is so good!.. it hot. It's fresh. It's fast. Well worth it!!
5/30/2017,5,"Konichiwa! this place is just great. Ordered a bowl mixed with salmon with tuna and was truly great. The prices are fair, fast service, great menu and selections. Had also some sushi and soup with no complaints. Finally found a place that i can come back regularly without having a bad experience. One of the most cool things is the Coca Cola machine that has all the flavors, i love that machine because it gives you different options on what to drink at the place. Cant wait to come back Thank you for existing !."
4/20/2018,4,"Good food, my main disappointment is the plastic sauce cups that come even with dine-in orders. It is very wasteful. Especially confusing since they had an earth day sign at the register  ...."
11/19/2019,5,"This is my favorite restaurant,we will come to eat once a week,the variety is also special.My mother and my son love to eat"
1/3/2017,4,"The second this place opened the lines were out the door and there's still a crowd. I've been to bentos up in Gainesville and Orlando and the only thing lacking at this location is the quality of the sushi. I like the sushi rolls at the other locations better. The place is really clean and a lot of seating available. My favorite thing to order is the spicy cream chicken; in a brown rice bowl, mini udon bowl, or a bento box. I go for the bento box if I want a little bit of everything and not be too full. The mini udon is really good but super filling. The portions are pretty big, so you'll be full and probably have leftovers. The curry katsu with red curry is pretty good if you want a bit of spice. The service is pretty good. It just depends on what time you go, but normally the food doesn't take too long."
7/9/2019,5,"I have eaten at several Poke spots in Fort Lauderdale area, but I still come back to Bento's Hawaiian bowl.  It is still my favorite."
5/16/2017,4,"I was hesitant about trying this place because a friend of mine had a bad experience there. The place is new and clean. You walk up to the register, order your food, and wait at the table for someone to find your number and deliver the food. I ordered the chicken and shrimp general tso bento box and it was delicious. The bento box included the protein, brown rice, noodles, green beens, a salad, and fried wonton pieces with a sweet sauce. The food was fresh and tasty. The portions are very generous and I was able to eat the rest for dinner. The fried wonton pieces were stale but over all, I had a good experience and I can't wait to try other items on their menu."
11/2/2018,5,"Fast-casual asian food done right! I've been to a couple Bento locations in Orlando and this one has to be my favorite. Whenever I can't decide what I want for lunch or dinner, Bento is my go to. I always call to order for pickup and it's seamless every time, usually ready within 15 mins or less. Everything is really efficient and food is great and reasonably priced. I'm a fan of their poke bowls, and spicy cream noodle bowls/bento boxes (think they call it pao pao sauce now). Definitely check it out if you're ever in the Davie area."
8/6/2019,3,"This is my second time eating here, first time take out. I was helped by a really sweet woman named Aleeha and the place was filled with lunch time customers but I was helped fast and waited less than 10 mins for my food. I went with the sushi bento box and a miso soup. The box came with a salad, some type of cold noodle dish, a california roll and four pieces each of the bagel roll and mt fuji roll. The rolls were pretty good and tasted fresh, the surprise was the noodles. They have a weird almost slimy consistency to them but they were delish. The soup was great, nice flavorful broth. The disappointment was my jasmine milk tea. I had asked if I could mix flavors with it and was told I couldn't so I just went with a standard jasmine milk tea with boba, one of my go to drinks. It was awful, I threw it all away. It was very bitter, no sweetness to it. I'll definitely be back to try their hot foods."
9/24/2019,2,"Bento has a fun vibe and some delicious food options.  However, I have had several negative experiences that prevent me from going back.  On two separate occasions, I was served potstickers that were frozen in the middle.  When I asked for another dish as a replacement, my request was refused as the cost was ""too much"".  Additionally, I have severe shellfish and peanut allergies that can be avoided if kept separate from other foods.  When I made that request, the cashier made no notation of it on my order, and I had an allergic reaction afterward.  I do not appreciate this lack of accommodation and have no desire to return to this restaurant.  Allergy sufferers, be on guard!"
12/13/2016,2,"This is obviously a chain restaurant, which I try to stay away from, especially when it comes to sushi. I knew this place had recently opened so I looked it up and decided to call in a pick up order. Thank goodness for that. This place was packed! there wasn't an empty seat in the house and there were several parties waiting to order in line. I made my way through over to the pick up area. Cashier was very nice. I payed for my order and went home.My fiance ordered a bento box. It had Mongolian steak (very fatty), ginger salad, noodles(tasteless), white rice, and another side. He also ordered a California roll and Miso soup. The Miso soup was delicious. I ordered the wakame salad and a Bamboo roll, which were both okay. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I've had waaaaaaaay better sushi. I would have given it three stars, but our stomach aches afterwards forced me to give it a two."
2/10/2019,5,The bento box and poke bowl are amazing! Can't go wrong with any combination. I usually do the red curry shrimp bento or the spicy tuna poke bowl. Bubble tea options are great too!
4/22/2019,3,"This isn't bad for lunch but definitely wouldn't be my go to spot. There are definitely better places to eat at for Asian cuisine and this place was just mediocre to me. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Their bubble tea is a bland, definitely not worth the money I paid for. My friend got the Mongolian beef and it was too salty. I got the chicken katsu...it wasn't bad but I had better. The lomein noodles weren't that great in my opinion, it lacked flavor and seemed a little on the dry side."
3/7/2017,5,"Really yummy Asian food!!! Similar to pei Wei but with a lot more options! You order at the counter & then they bring you your food to your table. They have a full sushi menu with rolls, hand rolls, & ahi tuna bowls. They also have a create your own noodle/rice dish with various meat, veggie, & sauce options! I picked beef udon noodles with veggies & a yummy Szechuan sauce. The food came fresh and full of yummy flavor! The portions are a good amount & my stomach was left happy. Not to mention the cute cashiers... Lol highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner! Heard it can get really busy around lunch time."
9/17/2016,5,"So glad to see this place in SoFlo! Been eyeing this place with KC ever since the 'coming soon' signs were posted on their windows. To our expectations, it pretty much fulfilled every aspect of the other Bento Cafes we've been to up North, despite the hectic first week rush and new hirees!As soon as we walked in we were already in line. It was a full house, on a Thursday too! The line didn't progress as fast as we'd hope for but luckily we weren't starving. It's self seating so 'strategize' accordingly hahah.My usual is the Spicy Salmon and Tuna Bowl but instead I went for the 'build your own' and maxed out on their protein of 3. Here's my breakdown: White Rice / Salmon, Spicy Salmon, and Spicy Tuna / Avocado, Masago, Tempura Flakes, Wakame / Spicy Mayo, White SaucePortion was perfect for it's price (11ish) and I think I've found my new go-to! Okay maybe the bowl isn't new in comparison but I was uber satisfied. Had the Thai Tea with no boba and it was pretty solid. KC ended up getting her original favorite, Spicy Cream Shrimp with Mini Udon Noodles. It was my first time trying it and it was yummy as well. Tough decisions will be made next visit. She also had the Honey Dew Milk Tea with Lychee Jelly. It was too sweet for my taste and the consistency seemed a bit grainy. Midway of our meal the place emptied out and it seems like we just caught a wave at the wrong time. So in reality the wait isn't consistently terrible, at least for a weekday. Will surely be back for my poke bowl cravings and hopefully a Bento Blue emerges further South!"
12/27/2016,5,"I've tried a few different poke bowl places but this one is my current favorite. You can choose from a variety of different toppings to add on top of the bowl. I order the poke salmon and the fish is always fresh. There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and never a long wait. They have a huge menu: wok stir fry, sushi rolls, bento box, poke, noodle and rice bowls. They also have a ton of boba tea flavors."
5/30/2017,5,"I was so happy to learn that Bentos opened down here! Back home I went to this place all the time. I usually order the bento box with the Mexican roll, cali roll, and Mount Fuji. Let me tell you about the Mount Fuji. Once you get this roll you will always order it. My husband even likes it and he HATES sushi so that should tell you something. My husband usually gets the teriyaki bowl with noodles and he always enjoys it. The food always comes out fast here so you don't want long to get it."
3/2/2017,5,"I loved the create your own poke bowl. The portions were big and the fish was fresh and delicious.The bento boxes were also huge.Everything was tasty and the place is clean and lively. Furthermore, the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.Eating here again is on my ""to do"" list next time I'm in Florida. There were many interesting items on the menu I'd love to try when I visit again.Now, if only they would open in NYC....."
4/21/2017,5,"Perfect spot for quick service Asian cuisine. There was a review that mentioned how long the lunch rush line was, and I have to agree with that. There was a long line, however, we seemed to come as the lunch rush was starting to go down so we were able to grab a table with no wait. They have a lot of servers picking up tables and cleaning them for a quick turnaround. The food was very good. I could taste good quality and it was freshly prepared. I had a sushi roll that was delicious, and my kids had chicken fried rice that they ate up entirely. Husband had a noodle bowl that was great too. All the dishes being served looked great and appetizing. We are happy with our experience and definitely plan on returning. Enjoy!"
4/14/2017,5,"This is the first Bento Cafe place I've tried. Its really tasty. The food is great A quality and tastes super fresh. Theyre busy with lots of Asians there, so from what I've heard that means the place is really good. :) Must try. Its like a tropichop for sushi!"
11/19/2016,4,"Dig it. Ordered the customizable poke bowl with greens and not rice. Chose 3 tunas (poke and spicy marinated and sashimi) plus scallions, cucumber and jalapeño with spicy mayo and ginger sauce. It was fresh and delish and i def wanted to order some sushi. The bobas are great too- i got jasmine milk tea without bobas- it was ice cold, refreshing and gigantic. Order at the counter and take your number to a table of your choice and your meal will be brought out to you. The line was long, but it sped by fast- service was quick and efficient and the place was nice and spotless."
4/6/2017,5,"Really liked the food, they serve a lot and it's a really big place. The only thing I don't like is the service; it was blah."
4/4/2017,4,"We were introduced to this place from my college cousin-in-law that always talk about this place on regular whenever she comes back from Gainesville. I finally got the chance to try it out in Orlando but i'll leave that for another day and another review. When I heard that this was coming to SoFlo they never told us about a Grand Opening. We heard thru the grapevine that people just started showing up for a ""soft opening"" so we went there and lines weren't that long at all but I'm always willing to wait if it gets to that extent.So my favorite dish to get here is the Szechuan Beef with the large Udon noodles. I's very tasty and not too salty at all. And the must try sushi is the Miami roll that is filled with krab delite, tempura shrimp, avocado, steamed shrimp and spicy mayo. Very filling.This is my place to go when I'm in the area."
7/4/2017,3,Food is ok. Service is questionable. The Asian lady with glasses and pony tail is not nice. I ordered Taiwanese beef noddle soup. It's very authentic and tasty. Bento box is so so. Boba tea is terrible.
4/7/2019,4,First time I took my daughter and got a kids noodle meal. It was horrible. Don't get that. It's definitely lower quality meat and noodles. It took me 6months to go back and try again. This time I told my kids to order from the adult regular menu. I got the pad Thai and enjoyed the spice. They each got a separate noodles dish and seemed to enjoy it better then the kids meal.
6/27/2019,5,My favorite. Love everything I've tried there and the price is great. Never get sick of it.
8/15/2019,5,"I love this place!!! My husband and I were in this plaza and we saw this place and decided to give it a try. The food was so good. There were so many options and the portions were good as well. I wish they would open one in East Fort Lauderdale or close to it. I would come here at least once a week. Oh, and their bubble tea, if you haven't tried it please do. It's good!!! Great experience!!"
4/4/2018,5,The food tastes great. They have bubble teas which I love. The bento boxes are the best though.
11/7/2018,5,"I first tried this place in Gainesville when I was in college so when I saw they opened a location I was beyond excited. we have gone a few times and time and time again it never disappoints. Their menu is vast, Service is fast and food is amazing. Must try!"
3/28/2019,4,"Great food, not loving the boba tea not sure if it's the flavor I got but it was extremely sweet. The food is delicious, great place for lunch. The bento box is one of my favs!"
12/7/2016,5,First time there tonight and I loved it!! Food was so yummy. Big portions and a great variety to choose from. From Asian food to Sushi. The service was great as well. Food came out within 10mins. Staff coming around to give you your food and picking it up when you are done is awesome.  Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu. So glad this opened up.
2/23/2019,5,"Bento is always my go to when I want fresh, healthy and cheap! We mostly order take out and they have never gotten our order wrong. We always order their build your own Poke bowls and double up on protein! Their garlic edamame is also delicious!"
1/11/2017,5,"Obsessed with Bento! Their sushi is fresh and delicious, and the couple other menu items I've had are also just as good. Pork Egg Rolls - very tasty, comes with a sweet Thai chili sauce to dip them in and it's a great balance on the salty/sweet + crispy texture. Mt. Fuji, Mexican, Philly, Cali rolls are all super fresh and oh so good! Their $10 combo box is a nice way to try a few different rolls each time but I can never get away from my favorites!Asian Cajun beef rice bowl is a hit with my husband, he typically asks for extra sauce, as they don't seem to provide enough otherwise but he loves it! Definitely recommend them for great priced food that is fast and delicious."
2/16/2019,4,I love this place to get something when you don't feel like cooking. It is fast food but good fast food. I love very spicy and they make your dish to your palate.   Convenient and good food.
10/1/2016,1,Worse experience!!!Even though there is lots of staff walking around the restaurant doing nothing andThey have three tills there was only one person taking orders with a queue all the way out the door I spent half of my lunch break putting an order in I had to to take my order to go by the end and had to eat it in a rushing in the car in the way to work. The concept is stupid and not efficient in anyway and that good wasn't that good either. Will never eat here again or by any means recommend it
12/10/2016,3,"Great ""chain-type"" sushi /noodle restaurant. Clean. Not smelly. Open seating. Modern. We shared a Bento Box and Sushi Roll. Reasonable or on par with most local prices. I didn't care for the ""tea"" or Boba. I'd go again. It's near Trader Joes, so it's a nice evening out. Go shop, then eat. TJMax, Ross plaza nearby. Family and date friendly. Can get busy since it's near the colleges, so folks in scrubs!"
10/1/2018,5,"I have owed bento cafe a review for a while now, I have been coming here for over a year now and the poke bowls are my addiction! Great quality food and consistent, it has yet to be gross. Employees are friendly as well, Keep doing what you do!"
1/31/2019,4,Just had a bomb spicy miso ramen! so good
11/17/2018,4,"Food is good. Sometimes they mess up your order though so check before you leave if picking up! Otherwise, great spot here in Davie."
11/3/2016,5,What is there not to like about Bento. My first time of many more visits! This place reminds me of Pei Wei but wayyyy better. I liked the casual dining atmosphere along with not having to place your order with a server. One of the things that is reminiscent of Pei Wei. Bento however has knocked it out the park with food options! Soo much to choose from not to mention all their Japanese tea offerings. I came in with fellow Yelper @ReixaC for lunch and walking in the place was packed with also a long line. Not too much to worry about bc the line moved quickly and before I knew it I was placing my order. I had the Korean Shrimp Bento box w/ a side order Garlic Edamame. We found seating at the community table and within 5-7min my food was in front of me. Talk about quick!I loved that my box had a little bit of everything! The  shrimp portion had lots of flavor and he green beans were crisp and not over cooked and the side salad was so fresh. Another great addition was a little treat of sweetness for after my meal. Kinda like a dessert which was crispy wonton chips with a sweet sauce. Nice way to top of the meal. Oh and the edamame was also very good and def garlicky.if you like garlic....check it out.
1/24/2017,5,"One of my favorite places for Japanese food. Every time I've dined here, the food has been delicious and fresh. The line is normally long and can be slow, but worth the wait. I recommend the sesame shrimp with lo-mein noodles and the vegetable spring rolls."
7/10/2017,4,"Great spot for your Asian fix. Has Japanese, Thai, Chinese, I think every Asian culinary staple. The Poke bowls are my personal preference here, with fresh fish and filling portions. Aside from the fresh food and hearty portions, the service is very good. Although mostly younger staff, very professional and willing to take care of any issue to assure you're satisfaction. The best part for any visual eater as myself is that their screens show their menu item. So wait long enough and I'm sure you'll see something you'll like. At times lines may be long, but food doesn't take long to get to your table and plenty of seating area all around."
9/23/2016,1,"The interior is not bad. The foods are nothing special and be tolerable. It may be presentable but commercialized fast food taste nothing to be proud of the origin of the dishes but a shame. Is pad Thai supposed to be served with no citrus and too sour? Even the orange chicken was too sour as well. Brown rice not well cooked. What a shame. If you cannot cook rice well then you shouldn't serve Oriental food. I would like to try the sushi but.... I hmm. Well if this is a fast food joint then I would give credit for being a bit ""upscale"" than regular fast food at the malls. Tea drinks are overprice with every scoop of powder only cost no more than 50 cents."
9/25/2016,1,"Tried to order take out over the phone and was denied 45 minutes to closing. The manager said that I'm welcome to come in and order in person. Hey manager, if you're still taking orders you should have taken mine. Tip: wait a few months when they get better staff and more business sense"
9/18/2017,4,"Great little spot in Davie, the service for lunch is quick and the price is good. For about 12-15 dollars you get a good size meal and the taste is very good. You just walk in place your order in the front and they bring your food to the table. I think their sushi is a bit on the small size but the taste is really good. You can mix and match almost anything with their bowls so you always get what you want."
10/15/2016,4,I'm not a big sushi guy but this was really good. Will visit a few more times before I flesh out a full review.
6/18/2017,4,Nice place for a quick lunch. Food tastes fresh and arrives quickly. Service is friendly. It gets packed and parking is tough to find during lunch hours. The poke bowls are great. Boba teas are also good. Will come again to try rest of menu.
1/13/2019,5,I go to school at FAU and wanted to check out local places that's when I stumbled onto this place. I love the food here and the service. I've never had a bad experience here. I usually go for the teriyaki noodle bowl and the krab wonton. They are spectacular. Sometimes i end up driving to this restaurant even if it is out of my way.
6/12/2017,4,"Best place for Poke' Bowl in town, hands down. The staff are very nice and helpful. The line to order will be long on lunch and dinner time but worth the wait. We always stop by after our grocery shopping at Trader Joe's or in the neighborhood."
2/16/2019,5,I really like their customer service. Even on their most congested days they are fast. Saturday/late lunch time. Should anything come up they are quick to remedy or help! I would like to particularly mention the manager there ESTEBAN. Very professional and extremely courteous when something I had ordered wasn't what I expected. Managers with Esteban's type of customer service skills and prompt attention will run a great restaurant. Very hard to find this kind service anymore. I will return!
6/3/2017,5,"Excellent food, great environment ! Like the poke with poke soy sauce! Matcha boba tea is one of the best I have tried in the area."
4/19/2019,5,"Bento is wats so fresh and fast service.  Love the special Mexican roll or the veggie roll. Sushi is always amazing . Honestly any of the bowls are great , noodles or rice and love that you can get veggie as protein.  Very vegetarian friendly!"
1/31/2017,4,"I've only been here a few times because I've stopped dining out as much as I used to. I went in when they had just opened it and it was a little overwhelming. The noise of all the customers and commotion was a bit too much for me to handle, so I decided to take it togo. So after looking through their giant menu and not being able to decide what I wanted, I figured to get a little bit of everything with their bento box. It was fantastic!I've been back a few more times and I really do recommend the poke bowl! You can customize is however you like and the portion is great. The marinated tuna and salmon was fresh and tasted fantastic. The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was that it is slightly overpriced (it is almost impossible to spend less than 10 dollars here, for one plate)  and that the atmosphere isn't the most welcoming as well as the ridiculously long menu."
9/17/2016,4,We've been waiting for this place to open! Ok so we went around noon. The line was wrapped around the store. There was s nice girl at the door passing out menus and explaining the menu setup. The line moved fairly fast and when we got to the register another nice girl explained further because we still had some questions. I had the pineapple Thai fried rice and a vanilla milk boba tea. All together it was $12 and some change. Will be back to try other items. The decor is nice too.
9/15/2016,5,Previous fan of BENTO from going to school in Gainesville. So excited that they have opened one down here! Food is delicious as always and they have bubble tea as well. The restaurant has a really cool vibe inside and the staff are all super friendly. No complaints happy to see they're off to a great start down here!
4/14/2019,2,"Today I went in and they were out of milk tea for bubble tea. No big deal if it's the first time, even a second time I can understand that things happen. However, this is probably the fifth time I've come in and they have been out of milk tea in the past 6 months. It's a business that serves food; act like it."
3/17/2017,4,"Super quick, barely had to wait for the food despite a decent crowd. Sesame chicken was alright and the food could have been warmer but overall it was good!"
7/23/2017,3,I just don't really see what all the hype is about. The food was average sushi that you'd get anywhere at the same price except the rolls were kinda small to me.
5/30/2020,5,"Overall great place, food is good (though not great, meaning for an average meal you won't be disappointed), I go here often and am never disappointed. I would avoid the sushi, not that it's terrible, but if all their items the sushi is my least favorite. They have great rice bowls and really good bento boxes, my favorite is the pineapple chicken. I eat here about once a week and always happy with my experience."
9/20/2016,5,This place is so so good!! You get so much food for an amazing price! I recommend getting a poke bowl! For $11 you can get 3 different kinds of fish! And you get a lot of fish for your money!
12/15/2018,5,"Bento is my favorite place for any Asian fusion dish. They are my all time favorite poke place in south Florida for the price and quality of the poke bowls. They also have good sushi and also entre options. They have great boba drinks too. Besides Hawaiian, Japanese, and Chinese fusion options, they also have pad Thai. If you like Asian food you have to try this place."
1/28/2017,4,"A great addition to Davie food offerings!  All the food here is amazing. Sushi, noodle bowls, rice bowls, poke, etc. Also, Boba tea is delicious!!!   So many flavors to choose from!  I have eaten here many times since they opened and the place is a keeper.  The only reason they did not get 5 stars is that the restaurant is always blasting the air conditioning. I'm a big guy and I'm so cold in here.  I recommend that they up the temp a few degrees and this place would be perfect"
10/20/2016,4,"First time here today for lunch. Long line, but it went fairly quickly. Ordered the build your own poke bowl, which I loved. The prices were good, and it was super filling. I'm obsessed with bubble tea, so I ordered one. Sadly, I was disappointed. They don't have almond milk for their milk teas, and they don't have certain flavors either. I ordered the mango passion fruit green tea smoothie with boba. Way too sweet. I will definitely come back for the food, but I'll stick to M&H for the milk teas."
1/1/2019,5,"First time here and it was well worth it. My mom and I ordered a bento box with shrimp, szechuan style and a sushi combo box with the caliente roll and mt fugi roll. Both orders were great! The flavor was there and let me just say the szechuan shrimp was the perfect mix of flavor and spice. The staff was friendly and they were very accommodating. It's a busy location so just be on the look out if you're a big group."
5/16/2019,3,"The food is OK but the service, attitude for no reason. Sam took my order and it seems like she is NOT happy with her job. If you work as a cashier taking orders you would think she would be patient. I was ordering two bowls at the same time and was not aware she could only input one at a time, half way through with a nasty attitude tells me she can only do one. As I give me second bowl description and ask if I can do brown rice, she simply stares and passes a menu, OK...thanks yes, I would lie brown rice. No smiling, no people skills, nothing. She can be quick with orders but without the customer service aspect of it, it's nothing. Bummer."
11/2/2016,4,"Have gone here for lunch twice. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The food is ok. Somehow it tastes and feels like what it is, fast food Japanese food. Good enough to go back though. For exactly that, fast food Japanese food."
6/6/2018,5,"Love this place! It's delicious, fairly priced and fast! I usually order the poke bowl with salmon and brown rice or the pad thai with tofu. Both dishes are great! There are nice amount of options to choose from on the menu. The staff is always helpful and efficient. It gets super busy in the evenings on Friday & Saturday nights and at lunch time during the week. I recommended calling your order in and picking it up."
4/26/2019,5,Been here multiple time with my boo. When we feel like eating Japanese food. This is the first that comes up to our mind. Great bento!!
8/8/2018,5,"First time coming about a week ago, the guy really had the patience to explain the menu well to me. He recommended the poke bowl and I was super thrilled.The food is amazing and so is the service! A friend recommended this place and I'm glad she did. I'll definitely be back"
10/5/2016,4,"As an asian girl from California, I'm so excited to have this place in Davie! The range of menu items, fresh fish, & ability to customize your order is everything to me.Overall this place is awesome. Only critique is my boba was undercooked & my katsu curry bowl could have used a more proportionate serving of sauce as it was barely enough to wet my noodles (lol).The staff are all really friendly, although the food does seem to take a long time for such a highly staffed joint. Again, not a huge deal.I'll keep coming back!"
5/1/2017,5,"Great concept, and very convenient location.  Took the family on a Saturday night, so it was a little crazy inside.  I love Poke, and ordered the salmon Poke with jalapeños, red onion, edamame, and cucumber (they were out of avocado).  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  My wife ordered a Thai noodle with steak bowl which was also testy.  My son had a kid's chicken teriyaki and my daughter order the garlic chicken and broccoli.  We also ordered a side of steamed pork dumplings.  The chicken teriyaki was a little overcooked (or we just got some of the end pieces which had dried out), but he loved the sauce and portion was good for a kid's size.  All four of us loved the place, and will definitely be back soon."
12/13/2016,4,I am not a huge fan of asian cuisine but this place is good and the service is usually quick. It is right by NSU and BC so it does get packed during lunch time! I haven't tried much on the menu but recommend the spicy cream chicken!!
4/4/2020,1,"Ok I guess quarantine means less portions and terrible quality because the meal I got today was not what I usually get. Even my young son noticed the difference.....and now my stomach is feeling terrible. So disappointed, will not be going back."
9/21/2016,5,"Just incredible ... All I can say is DO NOT Miss this place !!!Being from NYC & very discerning when it comes to Asian food which there are many  authentic varieties.This place is spot on.Fresh and full of flavors.The staff are lovely ... After your order is in ... You have a seat and its brought to your table as each dish is ready , fresh & it's hot.Again , staff are friendly, helpful & with big smiles .This was an all around very joyful experience ...We will be back , again and again"
1/11/2017,4,"I've been of fan of Bento ever since I tried it in Gainesville years ago. Naturally, I was very excited to hear that they were opening up one in South Florida. This place looked really nice. The decor looked very modern and the service was good. The food was delicious and was prepared rather quickly. One evening I placed a call-in ordered and when I went to pick it up, they gave my food to the wrong person. I had to wait about 20 mins for them to remake my order. But the food was great as usual so I didn't mind all that much."
7/6/2017,5,They have the freshest sushi in town!Excellent food & great service:)The prices are fair and portion size is good!Highly recommend this sushi place.Though parking is hard to find because plaza is always crowded. That would be the only down fall. Over all worth the trip!
5/15/2018,1,"Disgusting!  Flies on soy sauce bottles at our table, steak rubbery with odd texture and off/going rancid flavor.  Literally only 6 broken pieces of soggy green beans in the bento box.  Got our sushi order wrong and gave allergy food we told them couldn't have.  It was good the first time we tried it but this recent visit will definitely be our LAST!  Grateful we didn't get food poisoning."
3/26/2019,4,"Every time I dine here I always receive quick service which is good if you are on a break or in between classes, the prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly, but this isn't a place for you if you want a true authentic cuisine."
10/17/2016,5,I was so excited for this place an let me tell it was exactly what I was expecting and more. Omg delicious !!! I had the bulgogi beef rice bowl
3/16/2019,2,"We first tried Bento in Gainesville and loved everything about it. We were excited when a location opened up nearby. Sadly, the food here is just okay. Servings are smaller and sloppy in presentation. Always crowded though with grad students from the local college. It's worth a try, but their Gainesville location is far superior."
10/9/2016,4,"First time at Bento Cafe.  Love the concept - affordable, great quality food. The portions are generous and it appears the quality of the ingredients are top notch.  I appreciate the number of options and how you can customize your bowls/boxes.  My husband and I arrived on Sunday - late afternoon and ordered a sesame rice bowl with steak, tuna/salmon Don, and a sushi combo box (to share) - Mexican and Special Mexican rolls. We were not disappointed.  The con: with the number of employees they have, we expected much faster service when ordering.  We stood in line (that stretched back to the door) for 18 mins before we made it to the front.  They had 2 tills open at the time, although you could see other employees standing around."
9/29/2018,5,This is an awesome and cool fast food Asian restaurant is part of my ritual . The pad Thai is very good and also Miso soup. Food portions are reasonable and the combination possibilities are endless. I simply love BENTO!!!
9/17/2016,5,"Love this place in Gainesville, but I love it even more here! From the moment you walk in a friendly face greets you and asks if you need help figuring out what to order. I was able to easily customize my order and it came out quickly. My boyfriend ordered something he ended up not liking and the manager quickly stepped in with a kind smile and helped us right away. Every single person I encountered that worked there was very friendly and helpful.  I look forward to coming again!"
11/11/2018,5,This is a great place for a quick Asian food. The food was well presented and the taste is a 5 star taste. The service is friendly and the establishment is extremely clean. If you want fresh and quick Asian food I advise you to try them you won't regret it.
4/18/2018,5,Can't never go wrong with good ole bentos. This was a stable in college when going to gainsville then in tallahasse. So happy they made one here in Davie. It's just as good as the other locations. My go to is the red curry with EXTRA chicken. As the base I go for the mini udon noodles. I highly recommend!!
8/13/2018,4,"Their food is OK, but nothing to write home about.  I've felt it lacks in flavor at times. I had their pad thai a few weeks ago and I wish it came with a little lime wedge. (I asked for some but they didn't have any). But their service is great and staff is always friendly. Cute place to grab lunch but be prepared to wait a while during lunch rush hour (between the hours of 11:45-2pm)."
6/21/2018,4,The food was great and the staff was accommodating and the atmosphere was very relaxed and inviting
2/25/2019,3,"I used to come here all the time but after so many order mess ups, I rarely come. I just ordered a shrimp fried rice with steak to go cause I was in a hurry and my bowl had no steak. This isn't the first time they've messed up and now I paid an extra $3 for joyI emailed them that say day and haven't gotten a response. Horrible customer service"
2/25/2019,4,"When in Davie, Bento is the perfect lunch or dinner stop. It's located in the middle of the Tower Shops and parking by the restaurant can get a little crazy, so I usually park in a more empty lot. This is probably my favorite place to grab some sushi and Bento's food really changed my perspective on sushi. The place does get very crowded but service is super quick. You wait in a line to order between a sushi combo box, create your own poke bowl, some kind of bowl and much more. Once you order, they provide a number for you to place at the table you're seating at. No long than 10 minutes later the food with start to arrive. The sushi rolls are made right in front of the customers which I find entertaining to water when I'm waiting. They do have drinks provided in a little fridge by the registers but they also have different Boba Teas with either milk and green tea and regular fountain drinks too. My go too is usually the sushi combo back with your choice of two different 4 piece rolls and served with a 10 piece California roll. Never forget to ask for side sauces because they are free but the spicy mayo makes everything taste better."
7/10/2017,5,Good fast food asian restaurant! Wide variety of plates to choose from at a good price
7/3/2018,5,What a great find! Had a couple of rolls and a bento box. All was delicious and a great value. Very clean space and speedy service. Overall - excellent place. I'm just sad there isn't one closer to my house!
10/21/2018,5,Love this little gem! Food is bomb and so is the ambiance. Super cute place with great food and great /fast service. General tso is to die for along with the boba teas.
12/17/2018,5,Great food. Fast service. Don't forget your free extra sauce side. If you go with kids they have an awesome kids meal and don't forget to ask them for the kids chopsticks.
3/17/2019,1,"Very slow service, we waited over 30 minutes in line, unprofessional service and no management or supervision"
12/9/2018,5,Bento is one of my favorite places to visit in Tower Shoppes. I always go for the poke bowl with salmon and tuna...and it never disappoints. Their boba tea options are endless and so delicious! The workers are always so friendly and make the experience that much better. Definitely a must visit for sushi lovers!
12/4/2018,3,"The poke bowls are great, the Katsu japanese curry is great, the spicy noodle soup was nasty, and their bubble teas( especially the fruit flavored ones) were bad. Everything else like noodles, udon, sushi, fried rice were ok...."
8/29/2018,3,"We started going to Bento right after they opened. My husband and i fell in love with the place! We were eating there 3/4 times a week. But alas, gradually the food got very inconsistent, the orders came out wrong. Now we get take out once a week or so. Every-time i tell my husband to check everything before you leave! As i write this my brown rice stir fry chicken bowl has white rice and the pieces of chicken are so thick i have to cut them all. We constantly dont get the sauce we ask for. I usually get the Poke bowl with spicy tuna on salad, not rice. One time they gave me regular tuna and when I asked about it i was told that's how they do it now, which is not correct.  The amount of salad has also gone down to a very small amount. I used to get it with tofu, but the last time i did, the tofu was hard like a rock and again i was told that's how they do it now. Prepped items are different all the time. Wrong wrong wrong most of the time. Sadly, probably by another few months we wont be eating there at all anymore.  I Hope management reads this and correct the inconsistencies because it really is a great addition to our area and if done correctly can continue to have a very good businessChecking back. Bento, your response telling me to get in touch through email. Seriously, your place is being run down. I suggest YOU get in touch with your employees. We've been back a couple times. Just picked up dinner and posted a picture of my udon soup. Unfortunately the forgot the udon part, just doubled up on broth as you see in the photo. When i called i get the usual apology. What good is an apology when you cant have dinner unless you want to make another rush hour drive after work to rectify another Bento screw up. What a waist of millions of dollars to open a great concept and let it turn to crap. On another note, the flies regular and fruit are a serious hazard that closed down another local restaurant this week."
11/6/2018,5,Always quick service.Food always tastes great. South Florida is lucky to have this restaurant. You won't be disappointed to eat here and will want to come back!
1/19/2019,5,"Where have you been, Bento!!! I just love this restaurant, super service, great affordable meals!!"
1/12/2019,3,The poke bowl was good not great. The ordering process was difficult and annoying. They could use better training with their staff and add more protein to the bowl.
10/16/2018,4,"Food is good...BUT beers shall/must be cold! Adding ice on a cup is not the proper solution, Miss Cashier...it is against the Caveman's Law!!!. Ice them on a cooler prior to put them for sale...AND keep them cold...specially on a Friday night."
11/15/2019,4,"I really love this place. I come quite often. I usually get the spicy cream chicken in a bowl and love every bite. However, I can't give them perfect 5 star rating since the meal I get comes with very little sauce, not even enough to coat all the rice, and they charge $1 for even a little extra sauce, a little ridiculous if you ask me. Sometimes it's difficult to find a place to sit and eat because it's always so busy, but I don't mind that. Other than the sauce thing, I've never had a problem."
1/4/2019,4,"I really enjoy the place, it has a meal for everyone here. My favorite is the poke bowls, the fish they use is pretty fresh; for the price too I'm impressed. I've also had the sushi, the dumplings are pretty decent, and lastly, the hot meals are awesome. The menu is pretty large, it is somewhat overwhelming to order there sometimes lol. They have these teas, I do not like sweet stuff. But my friends love them, so if you're into sweet stuff a lot you'll love it."
6/23/2018,3,Great fast food concept. Food is mediocre. I tried this chain first in Gainesville years ago and I wasn't impressed. My coworker wanted to go here last week so I decided to try the location in Davie and still years later I am still not quite impressed! They do give you large lunch portion. I am not a big eater so I prefer quality over quantity.
1/23/2018,5,"I first had Bento Cafe when I used to live in Orlando so when I moved to south Florida I was naturally excited when I found out a location was opening up closer to me. It's somewhere I can go to grab a quick bite or whenever I  just want to meet up with friends. Its also very convenient when I have no time to cook and grab some to-go for home. My top favorite menu items are definitely the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl with mini udon, Korean noodle bowl with mini udon, or their poke bowl with spicy tuna or spicy salmon."
6/16/2018,5,"I'm generally very picky about Asian food and restaurants, but this place really hit the spot- rich flavors. I love the Bento Noodle Bowls- almost all of the ones I tried are great. I like the casual setup and quick service. I'll definitely be back here."
8/27/2018,5,"Best Japanese Cafe Ever!!!! Totally Recommend! Best place to relax! Best food in the world if you are looking for Japanese food, this is the best to go!"
4/14/2018,5,LOVE Bento Cafe! Great quality sushi for a moderate price. Large portions that seriously satisfy any craving! You will NOT be disappointed!!
6/3/2018,5,Ate here for first time today.   Everyone's food was good.  Prices are reasonable.  Staff friendly.  Wish one was closer to me in Ft Laud.
9/24/2017,2,"Two stars because I love this place. Food is good, service is 50:50. The person I ordered with put my name down as Jim and not Kim. Took a few extra steps to find my order. Next my order yesterday had two long black hair in it. I was so grossed out. Never ever had that happened to me at bentos. Not even sure if I want go come back now."
5/26/2018,5,"Delicious and fresh, I had sweet and sour chicken with lo main noodles and lychee water so yummy. Will definitely be going back."
7/24/2018,5,Fresh and fast service. Love the variety in the menu. Just wish they were more straightforward with what foods have MSG and which don't. SO I always have to ask and make sure they ask the manager as most of the people taking the orders aren't sure. But other than that its amazing!
11/30/2019,5,Had an amazing experience with Maria! She was so kind and helpful despite the restaurant being PACKED. Love the food and service!
1/21/2017,5,"I had never been to this restaurant before, but I was impressed upon arrival. As soon as we entered the establishment we were greeted by a smiling staff member who gave us menus and told us we could find a table to sit at while we decided to order.As I had never been to this restaurant before, I asked the staff member what I should get and they suggested a variety of their popular dishes. I decided to order the spicy cream chicken bowl which was a wonderful decision. The price was perfect for my budget and the serving size was large enough to make two meals out of it, so I enjoyed it the following day for lunch! When ordering our food the service was speedy and kind. The staff checked up on us throughout our meal to ensure everything was running smoothly for us, and the bathrooms were very clean! Overall I had a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go again!"
7/8/2018,5,"Love this place. I always get sweet and sour chicken, but my wife tries something different every time and asks lots of questions. The cashiers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Ali is super awesome."
7/7/2018,5,"This is my favorite restaurant!!! I always order the honeydew milk tea with popping lychee pearls. It's amazing!! The food is honestly the best. The quality, flavors and price is on point! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves sushi! Next time you visit, try the TNT roll and the spicy cream chicken. It's phenomenal. You will not regret it."
1/3/2017,5,"The best, the best, the best, the best!!! Food cooked amazing every single time!!! I have been a patron for the last 10 years. When I lived in Gainesville this was my go to place almost every day, and when I moved to Ocala I drove at least twice a week to treat myself after a long day at work. When I moved to Miami I was almost sure if never get to eat there again. Then I moved to Ft. Lauderdale 4 years ago and just this past summer they opened up a location here...of all places!!!!! The food was exactly how I remembered as well as the amazing customer service!!   This place is a gem and Ft. Lauderdale just got that much better!!!"
4/9/2018,5,I definitely enjoy Bento! The food is usually delicious and the service is pretty much on point. They will bring your food out quite quickly and are always going around to remove any plates not needed!
10/9/2018,5,Great concept! This place is clean and the menu has great food choices! Highly recommended!
5/7/2017,4,"I came here while actually going to check out another restaurant, but this place caught my eye. Then I looked on yelp and saw the review of a few yelp friends and they were good and had great pictures. I decided to give this place the Ole yelp try and see how it stands up. I walked in to glance at the menu and was welcomed by not 1 but 2 ppl. I decided what I wanted and waited in line for maybe 10 seconds before being served fast service indeed. I ordered the Korean box with chicken and brown rice. I recently been to a Thai Korean place in Tallahassee so decided this is my go to option. The  box comes with a ginger salad of cucumber, and carrots and lettuce in a ginger dressing very tasty good to clean your pallet when changing between the different box options. The box also came with green beans  and noodles and what I belive to be a milk type dessert with  hard noodles I can't seem to think of that name as it was not listed on coming with the box but is a great part of the box very tasty.  I also tried the boba tea passion fruit and lychee pops. This was good but the ice got in the way of the boba the only down side to the tea, because the boba were small they were out of the bigger ones. This meal all for about 14$ the food it's self is 9.50  which is a good deal and very filling with the healthier options then regular Chinese food places. This place is fusion btw. I was saying it's fairly good for a quick lunch. My only concern was the meal wasn't so hot but yet warm, was cooked fine and warm enough to eat but not hot. I would like to try some of their other options as they also sell sushi and such. If your in the area and want something fresh give them a try, the box is the best option in my opinion just from my meal and what I saw as others, you get more food this way as well."
6/23/2018,5,We have been her twice now and everything we have ordered has been great. It's been busy both times but the service was fairly fast. This has become our favorite place to get sushi.
9/20/2017,1,"My friends and I use to come here a lot because we loved their food and service. Today we had the worst experience. First, they don't have the sushi with coconut anymore ( don't remember the name), it was one of the best. Then, the cashier was rude and had a terrible attitude. They were offering a special half off the spicy cream chicken rice bowl. I ordered to go and I couldn't because it was only for dine-in. Also, I order a side of spring rolls, which the menu specifies 3 rolls, I only got two and when I asked for the other one I was given the excuse that they were two because they were bigger. That, they don't specify on the menu. It was four of us ordering to go, around $50 in total, and we also we noticed portions to go are way smaller. All of us are super disappointed and go back. This is not the place it used to be!"
8/6/2017,4,I used to go all the time when I lived in Orlando so finding out they opened one down here was so exciting! I love about 30 minutes away but it is worth it. My go to that is an absolute must is the spicy cream chicken bento box. They give you a great amount for the price. The sauce is so hard to explain. It has a little kick to it yet sweet and creamy at the same time. The string beans that come with the box is surprisingly really good!
3/24/2018,5,Super quick service even when the line looks long. Food tastes great and is relatively inexpensive.
6/8/2018,5,"Love this place! Food is always fresh, hot and fast. So much to offer. Always look forward to visiting when I'm in the area"
10/25/2017,5,Such a great little sushi place. I was passing through the shopping center and really wanted soup and sushi so I yelped (of course) and this place popped up. The reviews seemed good so I gave it a go. Definitely a cool spot. Took my food to go but the soup was great and the sushi was fresh. Quick service and quick takeout too. Definitely recommend this place.
10/30/2019,1,"Honestly i'm just so disappointed, i've been coming here for years and today i walked in and was going to order chicken fried rice but they said they didn't have any made and then charged me the full price for shrimp that i don't even want. I asked for the manager Maria and instead of making it right she simply just said we don't do exchanges and proceeded to just walk away."
5/14/2018,5,"I am in love with Bento, I have never gotten food from here and been disappointed. My only complaint is sometimes the wait time is a little much but the food is quality and worth it."
8/26/2018,4,"Very nice management.  Coming from the Pacific, we found Asia-Pacific (especially Japanese) cuisine somewhat disappointing in S. Florida.  Still, we have no interest in trashing someone's business, and admire people who try to make things better.  We wish the business much success!"
11/5/2018,5,"Bubble tea!!! Also a varied menu, delicious food and quick service. The staff is always very pleasant."
11/15/2018,4,"So yummy and fresh. I've never been here that it wasn't delicious, although they seem to be out of Ramen quite a bit. That's the reason for the 4 stars and not 5. Other than that...perfect!"
7/30/2018,5,"Always satisfied with Bento. Great place for lunch or dinner & their sushi is yummy. I think the quality is worth the price of their sushi. But I think the bowls are kinda expensive for the amount of food you get.  Overall good quality, tastes fresh."
10/25/2018,5,"The poke burritos are amazing, but sometimes the ratio of ingredients inside the burritos aren't consistent. I have only had this deliver via UberEats, but I am looking forward to checking out the restaurant in real life sometime soon!"
11/19/2017,4,"I want to hate this place since they built it on top of what was once a great weekly car show spot but I can't. The food was really good, the portions were, in the words of my father ""man-sized"" and the service was pleasant. You can't ask for more from a restaurant."
9/21/2018,4,Food and service is great. $0.50 for a side of Siracha is silly and a turnoff. *docks point*
9/15/2018,5,"This place has the best prices and the best poke bowls.  Call ahead and order your meal by phone and it will be waiting when you come in.  This place gets busy, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes during lunch hours or dinner hours if you don't call ahead."
6/30/2018,1,"Went to eat on Friday and place is infested with fruit flies. Disgusting! I lost my appetite the moment I looked at the wall and all you see were little black dots, all fruit flies."
8/12/2017,5,"Alright, so this chain restaurant started up in northern Florida, and this is the new and only south Florida location (so far)! I gotta say my first experience here was awesome!!! The staff is super sweet, our drinks and food came out quickly (around lunch hour), and the aesthetics inside are very pleasing! This was my first time at this chain, while my boyfriend had been to the Orlando location, so he helped me out with ordering although it's not hard at all, (I just tend to freak out around unfamiliar menus) I decided on the Asian Cajun noodle bowl w lo mein and chicken (I like a little spice in my life) and it was absolutely delicious! I also tried my boyfriends teriyaki chicken noodle bowl (teriyaki is always his go-to) and it was also scrumptious! What they do is give you your meat and noodle of choice, along with whichever sauce or seasoning your heart desired, but on the side in a little plastic dish. This is so you can add as much flavor as you please. I  poured all of my sauce in at once -because I'm just saucy like that, but it's still a nice concept! I loved what I ordered, but next time I will definitely go a little crazier (like some Poke!!!) They also have bento boxes, rice bowls and yummy sushi! Along with our noodle bowls we ordered 4 pieces of their Unagi rolls, and man they were so fresh and flavorful!! These were some quality eel rolls!! We wanted to get more, but figured we better not (kinda regretting it). Lastly, we of course had to order one of their many choices of boba tea. This is where I started sweating when ordering, because there are just too many combinations that I want to try *crying face* but sadly I cannot order them all at once (or so my boyfriend says I can't) and so my final decision came down to the passion fruit green tea with strawberry popping boba, and my boy ordered a strawberry milk tea with mango boba, both superrrrrr delicious! (My boyfriend and I agreed that we will be coming back in the near future for boba tea runs). Honestly I plan on this being my go-to Asian restaurant for the moment! It is seriously a great place for a nice fast-paced yet relaxing lunch or dinner! This is a place you bring your friends, fiancé, in-laws, cousins...anyone you're quite fond of! Because they'll be having a proper meal!"
3/11/2017,4,"Definitely enjoyed this place for a 1st try! The service is Extremely fast, and they staff is very professional and courteous! It's no P.F Changs but not bad for a quick chipotle-like-meal"
8/26/2017,4,"So excited to have a Bento down here in south Florida! I have gone to the other restaurant chains in Orlando, and thought they were all super delicious. The great quality about Bento is the available customization. They have lots of dishes to chose from, cooked, fried, raw or fresh. The sushi is really fresh, even though I didn't have a sushi roll, but I had the poke bowl. I wanna try more of their fried/cooked items. But everything looks really great, and I'm so happy with the fish and dish I did have."
9/18/2020,2,"I don't normally write reviews. But I have to say, I love Bento. The food is great. HOWEVER, the last 4 times...yes 4...my order has been incorrect. I've ordered on Uber Eats twice in the last month and both poke bowls were wrong. Both times I went to the restaurant after I ordered through delivery to get it fixed (which obviously defeats the purpose) and the lady at the front said that she packed it herself and that everything was correct. It was missing 3 items in my poke bowl. I ordered pick up today and on the app, it stated that my order was ready. I show up and they tell me that the order was never received. I will say that the guy managing the front door was doing an excellent job and I felt bad that he needed to run after additional items so many times. After waiting another 15 minutes, they brought out my order and was missing two items within the bowl. I don't understand how this can happen SO many times. Love the food. Staff needs to proof read."
9/17/2017,2,"Ok, I like the concept well enough that I wish there was one closer to me. But. I walked in on a random night and tried to order. And tried. And tried. Everything I asked about, and that was listed on the menu, they were out of or just didn't carry. Boba for my tea? Out. The flavor of tea? It was listed on the menu but they didn't carry it ""yet"". Out of avocado. Out of edamame. They've been around a long time and the place is often busy, so they must be doing something right. Maybe it was just an off night, but I won't be traveling to get there."
10/15/2017,5,"First time here. Vegans, so we tried to navigate the menu...luckily, Stephanie was a great help!! She told us the best options and gave great suggestions! Clean, fun atmosphere... great food!"
6/9/2018,5,"The only place my friends and I go to eat. Super inexpensive for amazing food, I can't recommend this place enough.Also, Danie is incredible! He's super friendly and makes eating at bento 5x better."
12/1/2017,1,"So I'm a little peeved. I called them to put in a lunch order for pickup. I called, no answer after 20 rings I hung up. Called back, figured they were busy being it was 1230 lunch time. Again, rings like 10x, then someone picked up and hung up. I called back again, no answer."
1/17/2017,3,"If you are looking for an Asian restaurant with a fast food concept. Bento Cafe is the place to be. It is kind of like a Pei Wei. You order your food at the counter and the servers will bring the food to your table. The menu is very extensive: sushi, stir fry from the wok, rice bowls noodle soups, even boba tea and much more! You can also create your own poke bowl or sushi rolls. I would not say Bento Cafe is an authentic Asian restaurant, but the quality is decent and I am sure anyone can find something they like on the menu!  Price is very affordable and service is fast and friendly! Definitely a great lunch spot for the college students around the area!"
11/20/2017,4,"So good - lots of choices. Not the best quality sushi you'll ever have, but gets the job done. The bowls are awesome, and I like how you can kind of make your own and mix and match!"
11/18/2017,4,Its pretty much the only decent place to get a teriyaki rice bowl around me... which means it's great in my book!
7/28/2017,4,"I love going to bento and I go often, their taro frozen smoothie is delicious, and I love getting their Pokè bowls, stir fry, and rolls. I like how it isn't a full sit down restaurant, but isn't fast food so to say. I like the location, it's 10 minutes away from me and I never hear bad things about this place. Only thing I do have to say though, last time I went, their wahoo and tuna tasted not too fresh. But they accommodated me and made me a new one, along with a free tea the next time I come."
5/21/2017,5,"I love bento so much that every trip to Gainesville was never complete without bento so having a bento close by is a dream come true. Quick, yummy, and great quality. There are so many choices for meat lovers and vegetarians. My favorite is the yellow curry tofu. It's not too heavy like most Thai places. They have a tons of bubble tea flavors as well. Not to mention it's extremely fair priced for the portions they offer. So many ways to get your food: over noodles, bento box (my fav), rice bowl etc. Its hard to find a place that serves vegetarian options in so many ways, so thank you bento! Place gets packed but don't let the line scare you, they are awesome  with getting your order down quick so the line goes down fast! I have so much love for bento that it's difficult to limit it to a yelp review haha. Hands down the best fast food type Asian fusion around (im sorry pei wei, someone else from the neighborhood now has my heart) Skip your local Chinese delivery and give bento a try, I promise you won't regret it!"
4/23/2017,2,"Not impressed Inferior to a Pei Wei. Seems busy, will one day try another entree and give another chance"
6/23/2017,4,Good place. Reasonable prices and good food. Modern decor you get you food fast and I will be back.
12/18/2016,4,"There's no good Asian restaurants here and Bento Cafe fills that void. It has everything-sushi, bubble tea, bento boxes, noodles, rice dishes, etc. It's not really authentic Asian food, but it's good enough for Davie. I prefer the Bento boxes, since I think I get more for the buck. I know people recommend the spicy cream chicken, but it's heavy and deep fried. Beware of dozing off after its consumption. I usually go for the broccoli chicken or garlic soy chicken which has more veggies. I come here every time I crave Asian food."
6/19/2017,3,"Sushi training wheels. That's what I'd call it.  You can pretty much get the same quality sushi at any decent grocery store these days. It wasn't bad but nothing was that good. I had a sushi box combination and if I closed my eyes and tried each piece I wouldn't be able to tell the difference out of three different roles.  The fried dumplings were OK with mediocre sauce. The cucumber and fake crab garnish salad shouldn't even be served because it had absolutely no flavor, if they would've marinated the cucumber in rice vinegar it would've been great.   Looking at the staff working there it's all a bunch of young kids, but the Decour is beautiful. I'd rather spend a dollar more per roll and get super high-quality sushi somewhere else."
10/30/2017,4,After reading the awesome reviews I had to try their bubble tea! I went in around 1pm on a Monday and the line was pretty short. I got a steak bowl with fried rice and sweet chili sauce on the side. I had to get a bubble tea so I tried the green tea passion fruit with boba. The steak bowl was pretty good and the veggies were really fressshhhh. My bubble tea was pretty good and definitely waited less than 5 mins. I will definitely go back!
9/4/2017,5,POKE BOWL!!  My favorite item on their menu.  So many choices....I suggest going through the menu before you head over there due to the amount of choices you have.  Sushi quality is way better than Shinju.  Their hot meals are full of flavor and it's a cool spot to enjoy your meal there. Great customer service!  Overall a great way to enjoy your favorite Asian flavors that won't hurt the wallet.  Buen provecho!
4/13/2017,5,Love this place.  It is located in the Tower Shops in Davie not in Plantation as someone else stated.  Traffic can be crazy in the area and parking is ok.  It does get very crowded at meal times and you may have to wait a bit it you are behind a person who has never been there and doesn't know how it works.  You order your food and then it is brought to your table.  You can order off of the menu and get sushi or cooked asian dishes.  You can also put together your own dish by choosing from different categories and lists on the menu.  The selection is quite large and portion are adequate.  It is usually chilly inside.  There is also a bit of outdoor seating.
4/26/2018,5,My favorite restaurant in Davie! If I had the money I would go here every day. Super helpful staff and fresh food.
3/10/2017,5,"Better than Pei Wei with many options to choose from and delicious at that. If you ever want to get some good food in a rush, I would definitely say Bento is an amazing choice to choose from. * their noodles are delicious."
3/29/2017,4,Good food nice portions decent prices. I had a noodle bowl with chicken yum. Thai ice tea was good too. Parking was not too bad. Casual atmosphere nice place to have a quick fresh lunch. Next  time I am going to try a Poke bowl.Went back and had a tuna Poke bowl. Nice portions very good will be back.
12/2/2016,3,"I had the build a poke-bowl with brown rice, shrimp tempura, carrots, asparagus, scallions, and crushed peanuts. The meal was tasty, although nothing stood out in particular. The portion size was generous for the price. The decor of the restaurant was nice, and the space was clean. I may come back here again."
12/29/2017,5,"Amazing noodles! I love this place. It has a good vibe. The only thing is the menu is a bit confusing, other than that it's delicious."
6/6/2017,4,"So I had a poke bowl with Tuna, and a bamboo roll, both were really good! The tuna could have been a little more fresh, which is why I am not giving it 5 stars. My fiance had the bulgolgi which he didn't like much, he said it was too spicy, I also felt that way about my poke bowl, but that could have been because I put a little too much spicy mayo."
9/28/2016,4,"I came to Bento on two different occasions, once when they just opened and then a few weeks after the grand opening. If you come at a busy time (ex: lunch) be prepared to wait in line. I ordered the create your own poke bowl and it was absolutely amazing!! I also got a thai iced tea with tapioca which was good. The second time I wanted to try something different so I ordered an item from the wok, ""spicy cream"" with shrimp and udon noodles. The noodles were a bit too thick for my liking and I emphasized on my dish being EXTRA spicy. When I received my order, it wasn't spicy at all which was a bummer. I tried a lychee green tea with tapioca which was yummy.  I don't think I'm going to order from the wok again (or atleast the spicy cream) but I'll definitely be coming back for the sushi or poke bowl!! Also, this place is super clean!"
11/1/2016,4,"This place is going to take a lot of my money. Been anticipating its arrival to Tower Shops for a while. Brings back a lot of memories from the original Bento I visited frequently in college. My favorite dish in college from Bento was the spicy salmon don so I had to get that during the first visit. I came to the conclusion as to why I love Bento so much. They have the best spicy mayo. Perfect amount of kick for me. The lines were long during the first few weeks, but moving pretty quickly now. Phones are also working now too for pick up orders. Walk straight to the third register. They now have a make your own poke bowl option where you can select your base, protein, four additions and sauces. I have been getting that since after the first visit. Its like adding a slight twist to my usual salmon don with additions such as mango and  asparagus, yet still get to choose wakame, masago and avocado. For me, one of the biggest appeals is the convenience factor for the variety of Asian food they serve. Its a good place to grab a casual lunch or when you don't feel like cooking dinner, but want to pick up something fast and decent."
6/20/2017,4,"Was so excited when I heard this place was coming to town! The first few weeks of the soft opening we were in there multiple times. So many choices, and I've yet to be disappointed in a meal. I think right now my favorite is the red curry chicken.  I've branched away from in a few times, but I keep going back to it. I get a boba tea to accompany my meal every time, cause how can I go there and not?!"
10/24/2016,5,"Since this place has opened,  I have eaten here 5 times. Everything I have had was delicious.  Sushi is amazing as well as bento boxes and noodle bowls. My favorite is red curry katsu chicken (extra spicy) and spicy cream chicken. the Mongolian steak is also really great!"
7/14/2017,5,"Favorite local Asian food! Whether we place an order to go or dine in, the food is great and the service is fast. My favorite is the sesame chicken bowl with rice. Sometimes there's a long line to place your order, but moves at a great speed."
5/17/2018,5,I came here too Eat with two of my friends yesterday we had the bento Fried rice it was so yummy also the server was so kind she had a sweet little voice and a welcoming smile her name was Ashley she sounded a little nervous she was not in the uniform as everyone else so I'm assuming she's training but she was awesome she checked on our table not once but twice removed dirty dishes we even left her a tip for how well she treated us we'll definitely be back for the good food and service
4/14/2017,5,"Excellent ! We just tried this restaurant for first time and it was great. The kids meals are so good, sushi rolls very good, everything we got was tasty and fresh. Hope they open more locations in broward county. Will def come back again"
5/13/2018,1,I had the stir fry chicken and lo mein bowl tonight and while eating my food I discovered a hair in my mouth!!! I wish I would've taken a picture but I was so disgusted and took the food back right away. I got a refund of course but that doesn't fix the fact of me having a hair in my damn mouth that is SOOOOO DISGUSTING and very UNSANITARY!! I won't ever eat from the place again. I don't even have a damn appetite anymore.
8/21/2017,4,This place is pretty good. I like it way better than pei wei. My first time here I got the bento box and it was pretty good for the price.
11/6/2017,5,"Everything is amazing. Food is fast, fresh and, delicious. I could eat there everyday and find something new. The boba drinks are awesome too."
2/13/2018,5,"Delicious, delicious asian fast-food type of spot.  My favorite place to stop and eat at when shopping in the area. Fast service."
6/16/2017,5,Love this place!!! They beat Pei Wei any day!! And the Milk Teas with pearls are a plus!!!
1/1/2017,4,The food is excellent...sushi was fresh and rolls were the perfect size! There is something for everyone on the menu. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is because the service was a little slow.
10/12/2017,5,"This place is a step up from Pei Wei with a similar concept. Their food selections are much broader and 100x better than Pie Wei. I had the chicken fried rice and Mexican roll which were scrumptious. The food was fresh, good and plentiful."
4/13/2017,5,"LOVE Bento! The lunch wait time to order was not bad on a Friday afternoon and I probably waited 5-10 minutes for my food to be cooked. Reminded me of Pei Wei but much better! The portion sizes are large and I put half of the big bowl of fried rice in a to-go box before digging in! Also, the Thai Fried Rice was delicious!! Only disappointment was that they did not have Red Chili Flakes!"
5/14/2017,5,The food was delicious..... I was a wee bit overwhelmed with all the options but it's a good overwhelmed! They work like a well oiled machine from the time I ordered and received my food it was probably 5 minutes.
10/16/2016,1,"I love, love, love the Bento in Orlando as well as Gainesville but this one needs to step it up. The dumplings were way, over fried, the edamame wasn't steamed enough, they told me 45 minutes to make ONE sushi roll and that they were still training a month into them being open. I'll try it again in like 3 months but as of right now... It was pretty gro"
9/28/2016,1,This is a great spot. I used to love coming to bento. I ate the tuna don two nights ago and now I have E. coli. Be careful what you eat.
7/1/2017,5,"I fell in love with this place. The location is very good, the food was very fresh and tasty! I will be there soon again"
9/19/2016,5,"Being a vegetarian it's often difficult to find a quality meal but this restaurant caters to all types of foodies, but that isn't the reason it deserves 5 stars. I just ate at a different location and ordered the same meal I had ordered last time, but it didn't taste quite the same. Fernando (an awesome employee that deserves a raise) made an awkward situation nothing but natural and replaced my food with something else I liked. I ordered the 4 piece veggie sushi roll and instead of bringing me 4 he brought me 8! I'm a happy and full customer and will definitely be returning :)"
12/30/2017,2,This is probably my 10th time going to Bento's.  This unfortunately will be my last time going. We ordered a Bento bowl and a sushi roll with two appetizers and all of it was very underwhelming. The broccoli wasn't cooked enough and the steak and shrimp tasted lousy. My wife and I were very disappointed at the quality of the food. I would suggest you find a new Asian bistro place to go to.
12/28/2017,5,The food was great and service was even better. My boyfriend is a vegan- he had a long day at work and didn't realize he ordered something with eggs. We told a server walking around who then asked his manager if I could be remade for us and they did it with no hassle and I got my food the first 5mins sitting down. I really enjoying my experience and even though it isn't over I had to hop on here and share it so far
3/21/2017,5,"Where do I begin! Amazing poke bowls with lots of raw delicious fish! Great sauces, amazing quality toppings! Great sushi, nice staff and awesome service. Do it."
3/18/2017,5,Very impressed with this place! Finally some great eateries coming to the area. Not sure about MSG ect but food tasted FRESH.
6/1/2017,5,"This place is great! Sushi, Asian fusion and Bubble Teas! Cheap for people on a budget. The portions are enough to save half for the next day too!"
4/2/2017,3,"The food is average, but it is fast!  So, it is convenient when you don't time much time but want to eat a quick bite.  I love boba tea - but, don't like theirs.  It is not expensive, but is not cheap for what you get, either."
9/17/2016,5,"Omg where to start! Such a nice staff, very efficient..the food was delicious and for the price point it's unbelievable...if you want quick and tasty without all the hassle please go now!!!"
12/21/2016,2,"Place needs to work on the over the phone order process. I tried 3 times on a Thursday around 8pm to place a call for pick up & was put on hold all 3 times without even a simple hello, how can i help you? Not to mention i was put on hold for 30 minutes each time. I understand the place can get busy, but the same attentiveness that is put into those who go to the location should be put into those who order over the phone.. if not then no point in having that feature available. Ended up having to go to the location, waiting in a really long line behind a family who didn't know what they wanted to wait even longer to get my food."
3/19/2017,5,This place was great! Ordered the poke bowl and it was great. Everything was fresh and the portions were a very good size. Will definitely come back.
7/30/2017,5,The food is always good and it's ready very fast. They don't offer student discounts.
7/30/2017,5,Delicious peanut sauce noodle. It's perfect for dinner if you are looking for something quick.
11/10/2017,5,Hands down one of my favorite places!!! Their poke bowls are amazing. The staff is extremely nice and always brings out your order within minutes of ordering. Decent price too :) definitely recommend
10/8/2016,5,Been here a bunch of times and they never disappoint! Their food is always fresh and fantastic! When you need a sushi fix this is the perfect spot. Excellent customer service and atmosphere as well. Perfect for a nice lunch and then some shopping in the plaza afterwards. My new to-go spot for sushi and Asian Fusion. We're blessed to have Bento in our neighborhood!!!
2/26/2017,5,Best Boba in South FL! Very fresh food love the Taro Milk tea! I wish they had more locations in South FL
12/30/2016,5,"One of my family's new favorite restaurants. Price is very fair and Sushi is delicious. Even my eight-year-old loves the chicken breast. Been there many times and the sushi always seemed very fresh, which is important. It is always super clean and the many staff they have there always seems very courteous. We don't eat shellfish so they even have a special menu to say exactly what you should stay away from. The seating space is very nice and the layout is fantastic. Very nice looking for some what fast food. This is the future of restaurants, folks!"
7/6/2017,4,"Awesome place to go for a variety of Asian food. Restaurant has a nice cool vibe and everyone that works there is super nice and always wants to make sure you're doing fine. Food is good but nothing out of this world. I've tried an array of their sushi rolls as well as their lo mein bowls and everything is good. Again, not amazing out of this world food but still good!"
6/30/2017,4,"Parking could be a problem and going during lunch hour as well due to long lines. Besides that, I enjoyed their Bento box with chicken, lo mein, two type of salads, string beans and rice. Nice ambiance and reasonable prices. I will be back to try their sushi!"
4/10/2017,4,"Great place to go for Lunch or Dinner. The food came very quickly, but the server wasn't sure which dish was which. Probably a new hire, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The tea was great, however they had no Boba the night I went, and they replaced it with a Lychee jelly which, for me, altered the taste of my Thai tea. However, it enhanced the flavor of my sister's Matcha tea. The food was plated adorably! I absolutely loved the Japanese style plates, with everything sectioned off. It was also portioned very well; I finished my plate feeling satiated. The food was also quite delicious! I'd normally say no to rice or string beans, but I cleaned my plate off completely. The sauce (I got the Garlic Soy) was very flavorful and complimented the rest of the dish. The noodles were so tasty that I could eat them by itself. The atmosphere was friendly as well, and the decor was nice too. However, it was a bit cold inside. Altogether, I would definitely go again, and I plan on doing so!"
5/17/2019,4,"The food is delicious. I'm just not so crazy that the poke bowls always seem to come out much much much later than the hot food. By the time the poke bowls come out everyone who had hot food already finished eating. Other than that, like I said, the food is delicious."
4/6/2017,4,"Always buzzing w customers. Wish the online order system was up and running, that would save a lot of time seeing that the restaurant is located in the middle of Nova,FAU & Broward College. Aside from that the food is worth any wait time you may encounter."
5/13/2019,4,"So the first thing you think is oh no another fast food Asian place, but that is hardly the case! I love this place! Everything is always fresh and nicely presented and being able to completely customize your poke bowl or bento box is really cool.I eat here frequently and I am never disappointed."
3/18/2019,5,"My favorite place for poke bowls. The fish is always fresh, portions of protein are decent, good selection of additions and sauces. It gets crowded, so I mostly call in for takeout and it's very quick and convenient."
3/23/2017,5,"Where do I start with Bento. I eat here at least once a week and not once have I ever been disappointed. The food is great. Everything I've had from the red curry, asian cajun, spicy cream, bulgogi, etc etc has been on point. Even their sushi is great. The selection is massive. I think all of that plus the fact that all of the meals usually are under $10:00 is great. Customer service is great too, every time I've ordered take out its always in order and they never miss anything. Kudos for that. I wish they had a location in Miami. But since I am in plantation for work 5 days a week, its not too bad. ha"
6/8/2017,5,Fantastic food!  Fabulous staff!  But yeah... either call ahead or come at off peak times.  Food is fresh and delicious - there's so much to choose from so everybody is always happy.  Dine in or take out - this food is worth the trip!
1/21/2017,5,"I cannot get enough! My favorite sushi place around. I usually order the Japanese bagel which is made with smoked salmon. Very tasty and alot better than the fried options. I also have tried their. Mexican roll which is made with cooked shrimp aswell. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken roll and has tried different bento boxes and bowls. We try to order for take out because the line gets too long sometimes. But if you dont mind waiting, it worth the wait:)"
3/13/2017,5,Best place ever!! I'm obsessed I eat there everyday so far! The quality of the food is amazing and they get it to you so quick !
1/26/2019,4,"Bento is great! I love their Poke Bowls and they have a lot of good options. However, I am taking off one star because there have been a few times where some of the items I want for my poke bowl are not available (one time they didn't have salmon, another time they didn't have avocado, etc.). Besides this they have great customer service and I love that you can order over the phone and go straight to a separate line and pick it up!"
4/24/2019,5,I love going to Bento they are very decently priced and the food quality is great. I love that I can call in my order and pick it up. I just wished I could get it delivered because the drive from the office during lunch time is horrible and I only have a certain amount of time. But overall they are amazing!
8/21/2017,5,"favorite sushi place for now on, good quality food, tasty and good price. great place to chill"
11/9/2016,3,My husband and I went for the first time on a Thursday night around 7:30 pm. The line felt like it did not move! we waited about 20-25 minutes in line. The sushi was pretty good but my husband's dish (siracha sauce chicken and noodles) didn't taste fresh.
10/21/2017,5,"This place is fantastic for what it is. It is not the pinnacle of sushi or Thai food, but for a quick meal you cannot beat it for the quality or the price. I get to build your own poke bowl regularly and it is not only a good deal, but it tastes great. I highly recommend this place."
10/16/2017,4,"Nice place with great options of building your own sushi bowl. Portions were large; the bento boxes are humongous and my poké bowl was very filling. Their boba teas were also quite delicious! All of the fish tasted fresh and despite a long line when we entered, we were ordering in under five minutes and served in under 10."
1/22/2017,5,They have a good variety decent pricing. And sushi is good. Boba mil teas are really nice too. Definitely coming back for more
1/4/2019,5,"Always great service (in person & call ins), quick to get my food after ordering, and have never had any problems with my food... actually the complete opposite. I love the menu and the quality of food! Bento is my favorite place for sure."
10/13/2016,5,"The spicy cream chicken was amazing...I liked the light batter on the chicken with the creamy texture of the sauce. Food took a little while to come out and the line was long, but the food tasted great to me and the establishment was clean! Will be repeating here frequently."
7/11/2017,4,"For what it is --it is very good. Exceptionally large menu of sushi, sushi bowls, noodle and the usual Asian fare.  The place where it shines in the price. Not expensive for the quality or quantity.This is what Pie Wie should have been!However, bring a jacket as the place is always kept at a winterizing temperature."
1/6/2017,5,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere. I ordered the chicken Pad Tai and was very pleased. The serving sizes are generous, I got it to-go and i had it for lunch over 2 days (I am small). Very clean bathrooms and soda fountain area."
3/23/2017,5,"Best poke bowls! & Ive never seen this place without a line, would definitely recommend."
7/5/2017,5,This is probably one of my favorite sushi places in Davie! I'm a student at Nova and eat here at least once a week. Everything from the rolls to the poke bowls to the fried rice is delicious. If you aren't wanting sushi I would highly recommend the pineapple fried rice. It's to die for! The spicy Don bowl is also out of this world and about 3 times the food for the same price as one sushi roll. Highly recommend!
11/4/2016,5,Awesome place with so many choices. Randomly came here after class and loooveed the bento box. Definitely coming back!
11/1/2016,5,I almost cried when I saw that there was a Bentos in S. Flo. The spicy tuna don is out of this world! The curry chicken bento box was so dank too. It was my cousins first time and she loved it. I do not mind the 30 minute drive and all that traffic around that area just to get me some spicy tuna don:). I will be taking my fiance this weekend since he is coming home from over seas(he's very excited). Prices are fair and portions are huge.
10/29/2016,1,"Sitting here in this new place so shocked at treatment . I did a ""create your own poke bowl"" when I asked for 1/2 rice 1/2 lettuce they informed me that cannot be done? Really you can't take some lettuce and some rice and shove it in a bowl? I asked a manager what the problem was and she informed me as well that it is absolutely impossible to take some rice and some lettuce and put it in a bowl, she also informed me that most places don't have a create your own poke bowl and basically I should be thankful that they even have a create your own poke. So I asked for a side of plain lettuce on the side since it's such an impossible task for the people who work here to do . Upon receiving my bowl I noticed it was 95% rice 2.5 % toppings and 2.5% eel. Ansolutly astonished at the service I was given by the girl at the counter , the mananger and the appearance of this so called ""poke bowl "" don't come here don't give this place and their nasty employees a dime . Was so excited to try this place and so beyond disappointed"
12/20/2016,4,This place reminds me of Pei Wei but with better options. Both times I've gone I've had the bento box which has pretty good portions. The sushi here is not for the person who likes authentic sushi not bad but more main stream. Service is good as well but you can tell who likes their job and who's there collecting their check. Over all a great place to check out!
8/3/2018,2,I'm not sure if it's the over priced menu or the questionable quality but this place just dosnt sit well with my stomach or wallet. Maybe it was cause I tried it early on when it first opened. I just gotta go back and give it another try I guess.
12/12/2016,5,Love this placeeeeee it's quick and easy Asian food college friendly good prices similar to mr robotos good for when you want some sushi but don't wanna sit somewhere super fancy their bento boxes are awesome
2/28/2017,5,"All the employees here are very nice and attentive, food quality always the best and quick service too"
9/15/2016,5,I'm so happy to have this place near my office. We tried it today and everyone loved it! Will definitely coming back for more.
6/11/2017,2,I ordered here for the first time and I will not be going back. I ordered the beef bulgogi and not only was t cooked way to fast but it did not taste right. The beef did it taste good and there was barely any sauce on it. I was extremely disappointed. I will not order from here again.
6/10/2017,5,Nice place for lunch or light dinner.  Meat is well seasoned and sushi is quite decent.
1/20/2019,5,Build your own poke is great!!!  Szechuan beef noodle soup is delish!!   Really enjoy their food!!   My go to poke place!!
2/15/2017,5,"I've been to Bento various times and have never walked out disappointed. I was very excited to try this location having only been to the one in Tallahassee. The staff is very friendly and very helpful and the food is delicious and fresh the location is also very clean. I always get the sushi combo box which has the California roll ( I add cream cheese), special Mexican and Mt. Fuji. My boyfriend has tried their Pad Tai and fried rice and has really liked both. I recommend this place to everyone!"
9/29/2016,2,If you want to stand up for an hour before you even order it's pretty good. Other than that the service once you order is pretty quick. The food is good and well priced. I still kinda think of it as a worse pie wei.
1/3/2019,5,"This is one of my favorite places to eat, love everything about it. You can not go wrong with anything off the menu and I'm addicted to the boba tea."
10/26/2016,2,"The food it self is good but the service...it's soooo slow.  Even when it's a pick-up order. I called in a order and was told that it would be ready in 15 mins. once I arrived, I had to wait almost 20 mins to get my food. If it wasn't because I was told "" 5 more minutes"" or ""they are almost done making it"" I would of left. Too bad I won't be going back."
10/21/2018,5,"I can eat here again and again! Good amount of items on the menu and plenty of space in the dining area. Prices are very good, particularly the sushi combo and the sushi is very good. My son had a kids meal, teriyaki chicken and noodles. It came in a cute bento box and there was a ton of food for a kids meal. Can't wait to go back!"
10/17/2016,5,"heard very good things, decided to check it out. once you walk in there are the menus then you walk up to the cashier and place your order then they bring it to you.. VERY FAST! my food came out so fast i thought it would be cold or not good but it was sooo good and hot! the staff was friendly. everything is basically self serve. they have the soda machine with over 100 sodas, the forks, chopsticks, napkins, to go box were all there. there is also boba tea there that's interesting. so many different options as well. i would deff come back and recommend"
10/15/2016,5,Love this place. Food comes out so fast. Love the poke bowls the most. The bento box is pretty redic too! Yum yum yum.
10/11/2016,4,As my poke mission continues... kobachi sauce here rocks. Sushi will apparently NEVER be as fresh and melt in your mouth as in HI. They need to add more veg to bowl and fish is not abundant either but will do. Also if all these poke shops are gonna start popping up can somebody please add furikake to their recipe!!!
4/14/2017,5,"I remember how awesome this place was back when I was in college. So when I found out they had one in Davie, I had to try it out. The ambiance is really nice and laid back. The cashier was very nice and offered a complimentary water cup while I waited for my to go food. The food was just how I remembered. The spicy cream chicken was excellent.  I got the Mexican roll also and that was good too. It was very nostalgic being in this place as it reminded me of my college years ."
10/4/2016,4,So glad to have this place in soflo! The choices are awesome and the quantity is big for the price you pay.  Tried their milk teas twice...very disappointed but other than that a great place for food.
8/9/2018,1,So disappointed to discover they use MSG in most everything. Discovered this after eating. Then had to deal with MSG symptoms. Why use it? Most restaurants stopped years ago. Won't return as long as they continue using MSG.
10/1/2016,5,"YESSSSS!!!! My favorite restaurant from Orlando has finally come right across the street from me!!! Just opened and already super busy. Waited as while in line but once we ordered food came out pretty quickly from kitchen and sushi bar. Place looks great. Must have the chicken yellow Thai curry bento box and tuna salmon don bowl. And don't forget the best part..... BOBA TEA!!!! Lychee milk tea my favorite!!! Excellent food and excellent prices, I'm gonna spend a lot of money here!!!"
10/1/2016,4,First time here.  Food is delicious. Service was good. Took a long time to order. Long line on Saturday at 1330 hrs. Still very enjoyable.
3/18/2017,5,This place is delicious and the price is reasonable... the spicy tuna and salmon don is to die for.
11/23/2016,5,"I figured the food would be good but I was very surprised to find the food was AMAZING!!! I've paid a lot more for sushi and still not gotten this quality. I cannot wait to come back for more! Try the poke bowls, they were generous and yummy!"
11/9/2016,2,"Skip the green tea it has so much sweetener in it that it defeats the purpose of ordering green tea.  Then they bring the wrong bowl out and they bring the main course before the appetizer....really disorganized.....sushi is on par with what you get at Publix, nothing special.  Recommend just skipping this place. Better to just go to your neighborhood sushi place and have a respectable sit down meal."
1/13/2019,2,"I'm so sad to leave a bad review since this had been one of my favorite places to eat.  It used to be worth the hassle of traffic on University and the lack of parking but now that my last three trips here have resulted in less than stellar experiences I shall be discontinuing my patronage.  The 1st strike was when I placed a to go order.  I picked up the bag and drove all the way home only to find the order incomplete.  The 2nd strike, several weeks later, was when I arrived to find no sushi on the menu.  The 3rd and final strike was no salmon on the menu.  Each time it's an effort to get to the shopping center and an effort to find parking and when three consecutive trips yield less than pleasant experiences I have to draw the line.  Sorry, Bento.  It was good until it wasn't."
7/18/2018,4,I've been here a few times and it's always very busy. I usually let my daughter ior grandson order while I grab a table. It's a bit noisy at lunchtime. The food is so good it's always a delight to go there for lunch.
7/15/2018,4,Been here twice good food. Very quick. Get your own drink and silverware (plastic) service is lighting quick and polite.
12/30/2018,5,I come here every other week to get dose of poke and most of the time its good sometimes they have little mistakes here and there but staff is super cool and always fix it right away.
9/19/2016,5,"I first found out about Bento in Orlando, and loved it so when this location opened it was a must try! To start, the restaurant is clean and the staff is attentive and helpful in terms of answering questions related to the menu. I didn't think it was possible to love Bento more than I already did. I recommend the create your own poke bowl (see pictures). The  food is delicious, I am definitely coming back!"
12/5/2016,5,"I love! So fresh and so filling! But yet so healthy, I get the spicy salmon tuna don bowl with brown rice!"
10/30/2016,5,This is my new favorite place to eat any day of the week! I haven't had one thing I did not like. The TNT roll is my favorite sushi roll but you can never go wrong with a poke bowl! Their pork dumplings and spring rolls are good too!
7/16/2018,5,"I love this place. The sushi is awesome, the service is great, and the people are nice."
10/21/2016,3,"I've been there twice. The first time was so full, every table. The food and service was awesome. The second time, the place was empty, the service and food sucked. I asked for a highchair, was told ok. She never brought it. Asked for the manager, was told ok, then ignored again. The manager finally came after having to go to the counter to get him. He apologized and said he would remake the food, after 20 minutes, he brought part of it, and by then the kids had had enough, he packed it to go. I wasn't hungry from waiting so long and brought it home. When we opened it to eat, just like the one there, it wasn't close to as good as the first time, I forgot to say, same food was ordered, and some of the tuna was inedible."
10/7/2017,2,"Disappointed, food was worse than wal mart deli service was slow. My order sat ready for 5 minutes before they gave it to me"
10/6/2018,4,"Love food, menu, atmosphere, great place to eat but try to avoid peak hours the lines get long"
9/25/2016,1,"Second time I have walked out disappointed. First time, I wanted just a tea and the girl would not let me place the order where take out orders are placed. She wanted me to wait 30 minutes just to get one tea. I am writing this review outside their restaurant as I walked out for the second time. The girl could not explain herself but what we understood was that the kitchen was backed up and that our meals would take 30 minutes to come out after we've waited the 30 minute line. She basically told us to leave as the party in front of us would be the last ones to order. Terrible service. I have tried their food before and it's nothing to wait in line for. Never again."
9/19/2016,1,Blah.  Terrible food. It took 20 minutes to get 2 rolls out and they brought my hot entree out 15 minutes before my daughters sushi! The cooks weren't even authentic sushiSo disappointed
9/19/2016,1,"The food is less than average !! Nothing special unless you are a real blue collar eater. It is rather inexpensive , but you get what you pay for .The place is nicely decorated and service is fast.The 90% of the dish us just rice rice rice, with some topping . Ridiculous. Every Sushi of higher quality serves much better dishes. If you are a large family and need to stuff your dear ones cheap , then , go there.This place is not recommended for people with better palatable taste."
11/29/2016,5,This place is Amazing! Blows away pei way and many other oriental restaurants. Staff was very nice also but the food was 10/10. Definitely will be returning.
8/13/2018,5,"Amazing Asian food here. I've tried a couple of different bowls and also their pad Thai and they are excellent. Food is always fresh, hot, and fast. I visit this place at least once a week for lunch. Haven't tried this sushi yet but heard that it is very good."
4/20/2018,5,"I love it here. My husband and I go all the time. It can be difficult to find options for eating out since I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not but Bentos has a great selection so that we can both be happy. I particular love their spicy avocado rolls and always get a bubble tea (passion fruit or taro). Although the lines can get long depending on the time, they take orders quickly and so you don't have to wait too long. The food also gets there in good time. Highly recommend for casual dining."
7/29/2017,1,This was recommended to me by a coworker when I mentioned how I love Boba/Bubble Tea. Since I was in the area running errands I stopped in for lunch. The line was all the way to the door so I thought that must be a good sign. I ordered the Thai pineapple fried rice bowl and a large Boba Tea. It cost me $14 but I thought I would wait and see how the food was before judging the prices. The tea was not bad but the size of the cup wasn't really what I would consider a large. I thought the price was excessive for green tea with a little flavoring added in. The server then came and told me that unfortunately they had no pineapple to make my dish. She asked if I wanted something else or to try it without the pineapple. I didn't feel like looking through the menu again so I just told her to make it without. She came back a minute later and said they also didn't have the sauce so they couldn't make the dish at all. She asked if I wanted to order something else. At this point I was very hungry and getting frustrated so I asked for a refund on the entree. She apologized and said she promised next time they wouldn't have the same issue. The experience and the prices turned me off from ever wanting to return again so I will find someplace else that offers Boba Tea in Broward.
5/13/2018,5,"I love this place especially the Pineapple Thai fried rice , the flavor is so rich and the spicy cream chicken with lomein . ALL TIME FAVORITE FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.!!!"
4/28/2018,1,I first want to say the food is awesome however I have a severe allergy to pineapples and they don't have a separate blender for people who suffer from allergies. The lady that rung me up was awesome but she asked her manager about allergie and the manager looked like she didnt care at all. Very poor management here.  Very upset customer today and I am a regular here .
10/24/2017,5,Never let down with bento! Quality and affordable food. Can't wait for the pines location to open up!
3/23/2017,5,"Was visiting family and made a stop by this place on our way to the beach.  Didn't expect much other than a quick boba tea, but  I have to say our server Ben made the stop worth it.  If you go, I'd recommend the crunch roll!"
1/23/2017,1,"Great setting and vibes from the employees! However, I ate the Rainbow roll and pork dumplings and ended up feeling nauseaous with the worst stomach ache. Turns out I had food poisoning!? The QUALITY of the sushi needs to get better!"
1/25/2017,5,I got a Bento Box with Mongolian Beef and a Red Dragon Roll and I shared both with my mom for lunch and it was more than enough and both were delicious! I loved all the little goodies in the Bento Box!
11/7/2016,5,I love this place! My fellow yelper introduced me to this place. Amazing!!!!! I wish I had one closer to my house : )Try the Mango BOBA blended ice drink it's good!
2/28/2018,5,"Love this restaurant, and it's right next to my other favorite restaurant. My only gripe is that it's always busy, but I can't really fault everyone for wanting to go there."
1/28/2017,1,"Want a meal covered in grease?! Then this is the spot for you!! Honestly they do have some pretty big portions but the food is very average. I could have got the same thing at another Asian joint for less. My husband and I were not impressed and ended up leaving more than half our food at the table. Wasn't worth the wait, or the money in my opinion."
4/18/2018,5,"Great food, reasonably priced. Servers were all very friendly. I liked that each type of meal had several options."
3/28/2018,1,never going here again!  Second time I find a piece of hair in my soup. The replacement meal had a piece of plastic.
10/16/2016,3,"The food is good but we found out they use msg. I wish they were more open about it. No where on their website does it say anything about msg. Finally I just called and sure enough, the lady said ""some of our dishes contain msg."" It's so sad because the noodles I had were pretty good. I won't be back...."
12/3/2017,2,"I don't get it... it's just a Pei Wei with sushi.  The rice box I got wasn't that interesting and the sushi was okay but not great. One thing it was, was very noisy and it was only half full.  To tell you the truth, I'm not going back. I'd rather go to the sushi buffet down the street and get a much bigger selection for just a little more money."
11/18/2017,4,"The food is pretty good, depending on what you order. The poke bowls and sushi are always great, but the rice bowls tend to be a mockup of buffet food. The bubble tea is perfectly made to taste, but the boba is usually a bit hard. We come here fairly often, and would recommend this place for anyone looking for a sushi dinner at a decent price."
11/10/2017,2,The food is ok; good enough. But don't come anywhere near a meal time. You just wait in line. People have no clue what they want and it holds everything up. The cashiers don't know how to answer questions and that makes it slower. If u decide you want anything else... back in line! That's what happened to me. I wanted to add on dumplings to a take out order. Double the wait. No triple; the cashiers stand there and data enter in front of your face. Not a fan.
7/16/2017,4,I go here all the time because my wife love this place. I like it because it is a safe place to have Asian food and sushi. Most Asian food places tend to sketch me out because of less than desirable sanitary conditions. This place is new and clean. Food is good and comes out quick. They have a lot of very fairly priced items on the menu but it is easy to run your bill up. My two personal favorites are the beef bulgogi and special Mexican roll.
1/31/2017,3,"Had such high hopes as I have eaten at the Gainesville location and several times when they opened plantation location.  I went there this week and it was barely acceptable. Rotten lettuce, noodles w no flavor and shrimp dish w 5 shrimp and mostly onions. Really disappointing.  Expect chain Asian food and you get what you pay for."
4/22/2017,5,Awesome concept. Been there numerous times and never had a bad experience. Pretty phenomenal considering how busy this place can get.
12/31/2016,1,"What a HUGE disappointment. Your customer service is disgusting. After ordering and waiting for twenty minutes a server comes and says ""oh did you order the sushi? Well it's going to be a while"" ....so I say ""what is a while? 5 more minutes, 10 minutes"" she looks at me like I'm a complete idiot and says ""like 30 minutes or 45. We are doing a catering order"". At this point I'm waiting for an apology or an offer to give me an alternate meal but nope, nothing. I go to the counter to get my money back and a nice young man asks me if I want to speak to a manger - yes, thank you I do. Bento, what an ineffectual Manager. No apology, no reason, again no offer of another meal, he just stood there. I expressed to him my annoyance in his lack of interest in my experience as a first time customer and again was met with a dry response. Never again. Bento, please train your manager on duty today to deal with customers. Here is what should have been said ""I am so very sorry, there was an issue in the kitchen and we are unable to prepare the meal you ordered. Would you like to see the menu the see if there is anything on the menu you would like to order""..... there you go!"
10/9/2017,4,"Sometimes it is a miss and they run out of ingredients, but every time a better than average tasting food. Overall not bad experience, good to visit now and then."
12/11/2017,5,"This is for the quality of their food and tastiness, but the staff could use some more training or just maybe more supervision.  My best friend and I went as we like to explore new places to eat and we asked for spicy mayo and soy sauce and never got it but the guys next to us got what they asked for almost right away and those guys even went a step further by asking us if we would like their sauce.  Other than that the food was great, hence the 5 stars!"
9/22/2017,5,"This is probably my favorite restaurant right now! it's super chill for like an afternoon little date. The food is AMAZING, everyone who works there is extremely nice! I love it! Would recommend to anyone! Best orange chicken ever over there!!!"
6/2/2017,4,Love the sushi here! Great prices and great menus.  Very casual setting and loved the dessert!!!!
5/30/2017,5,"The creamy chicken is amazing. Absolutely love this place. Sometimes the line is long during rush hours, but the service is great and the food is worth it. Avoid the line by ordering ahead and picking it up. I just wish they had outside seating!"
5/3/2017,3,"Loud and crowded. I don't think I saw a free table when I walked in but thank god I ordered over the phone. I spent $20 on 3 things and the only thing that was good was the California roll. The salad..... cmon guys I know it's ginger salad and a sushi place but dressing flavored like the SUSHI GINGER??? Gross. The girl gave me my bag and the dressing was literally less than half of the soufflé cup... Good thing I checked before walking out or I would have been pissed. I had an udon chicken broccoli bowl the broccoli was dry, my toddler wouldn't even eat it and he loves broccoli. the extra star is because no other sushi place sells Cali rolls already covered in masago! Best part!!i"
8/4/2017,3,14 people on line. ONE register open. Which is typical these days of many restaurants with this format. Service is sloooooooowwwwwwwwww.. Food is Ok but woefully salty.
12/28/2016,1,Who knows how the food is but the service sucks. I have never been to this place before and asked for a menu.  The girl at the register was rude and gave me a smart ass response when I asked. I glanced at the menu was eager to order because of reviews and I was craving sushi. But the more I replayed her rude remark in my head I decided not to spend my money at this establishment. There are other places around here with better service. I'll eat there.
6/28/2017,3,So obviously I was more than frustrated when I posted my last review but I can say that since then we have been back a few times and have even been able to place pick-up orders over the phone.  The last time I was there the cashier wasn't exactly the friendliest but our order was correct and tasty so it didn't really matter. The food is good but for some reason it's not as satisfying as the orlando locations.
6/25/2017,4,It's a fast food place ...casual concept. I ordered food to go. Delicious food!
6/16/2017,4,"Been to the bento cafe twice and both time the food, service and the price has been great. For about $40 you can 3 meals. Which for Asian food is good. Other places charged more. The food is great and a lot of choices. The portion size are good and atmosphere is too. I'm definitely going back."
2/28/2017,4,The food is. It that expensive and you have a wide selection of options when it comes to Asian food. It's a good place to try a little bit of everything all in one place. The poke bowls are great.
8/24/2017,3,Beautiful and clean place with friendly and helpful staff which is why I give it 3 stars but completely underwhelming. Sushi is very low grade and badly made (sushi rice to fish ratio was off). The bento box was unsalted. Rice was hard. I found a hair in my sushi. It was just an average place. Wouldn't frequent.
5/24/2017,2,"Have been here a few times and their Poke bowl selection and Szechuan bowl are pretty good. However, today was a perfect example of how you can ruin a customer relationship with one interaction, i was lectured by the order taker on the proper protocol to order my bowl, problem was she was taking my order on a notepad and therefore it was a moot point not to mention the condescending tone she used..."
12/19/2016,5,"My family loves this place. We try to stay away from chains especially when it comes to sushi. However, the sushi here is better than most sushi places I've eaten at. The bamboo tile is amazingggggg. My family always gets the bowls. By far our favorite is the sirracha garlic bowl! It's got a great spice and very tasty. It's quick easy and decently priced. Highly recommended"
3/2/2017,4,"Japanese food, Thai food. The rolls are good and fairly priced.  The cooked menu items are fair to good.  BUT THEN THERE IS THE WAIT.  This place is usually packed, even during off hours.  I have waited 20+ minutes for a take out order (ordered when I got there).  There's no website to order in advance, but you can call.  In one of the chicken dishes they used dark meat without specifying that on their menu.  I will go back, but probably only for the fairly priced sushi.  They never got an order wrong, but be prepared to wait.  This is not a fast food joint."
2/26/2017,1,We ordered takeout from here. They forgot to include our sauces. The food was good... until we found a hair in our soup. Definitely will be my last time ordering from here
2/17/2017,2,The McDonalds of Chinese food. Much better off finding an authentic hole in the wall. We won't be going back. Should've picked the falafel place.
2/17/2017,4,"The sushi is pretty good, but I'm a big fan of the bowls, in particular the katsu curry."
2/16/2017,4,Decent food and decent prices. I really liked it here and would definitely go again. It's perfect if you're looking for a quick lunch!
10/29/2016,2,"The largest issue for me with this restaurant is it's lack of professionalism. I called in to place an order for pick-up since it's always so busy inside. While I was placing the order the girl who answered, took my order repeated to make sure it was correct then hung up the phone before I could ask how much or how long ? I tried to call back no exaggeration 3 times no one picks up. On the 4th ring someone picks up and before I could complain they put me on hold. It really set the wrong tone for me. I'm honestly not sure if I'd ever come here again."
2/10/2017,4,"Nice food, nice setting. Bring a jacket the place is too cold, every time we go there it's freezing. Obviously good if we go back"
1/11/2017,5,First time going last night. Similar to Pei Wei with more variety and cheaper prices! Excellent food and always fresh! Highly recommend
9/20/2016,5,"Though the line to order was a bit long (only one cashier until I got to the register when a 2nd one opened), it was definitely worth the wait. I tried one of their sushi rolls ( Red dragon) and it was delicious, super fresh! I am definitely going back to try more!"
12/10/2016,5,Food is fresh and reasonably priced. We recently had Zeph(server) help us and he was very friendly and helpful. Easy place to go with or without the kids.
11/16/2016,5,"For the price, the food is great and the quality is there. We've always had good service and enjoyed every dish we tried. You must try Bento if you're looking for a quick, affordable Asian cuisine option for lunch! I should warn you that it can get quite busy, so plan accordingly if you have a limited amount of time for lunch!"
10/30/2016,1,Have been trying to call for pick-up for half an hour and it just rings and then disconnects.
11/14/2016,4,First tried it in Orlando and I'm so happy that there's a location here! I always get a salmon poke bowl or the stir fry tofu udon. Their rolls are great too! Nice dine in atmosphere.
11/18/2017,4,really good food- easy lunches with healthy options- sometimes the person cashing out can be clueless about toppings otherwise recommended
9/1/2022,4,"Four stars for being by far the best Bento restaurant I've been too! I've only been to one and this is the second lol but I loved the decor and layout of the restaurant. I thought it was pretty cool how they have a only hand washing sink next to the soda machine. We came in an hour prior to close so we didn't wait much at all for the food. The cashier was very friendly, patient and attentive! We were a group of five and couple of us had never been here. Even though I praised the inside, we ate outside as the night temperature was welcoming. I ended up cleaning the table myself as it was dirty.The food came out delicious! It was at the right temperature, not piping hot, and I wanna say ""fresh"" but I can tell the noodles were out for awhile BUT nonetheless delicious. The sushi was amazing! Had the TNT which was the best! The rainbow roll was ok, had better. The boba tea is AMAZING here! Wow! Super delicious and exquisite. Definitely get your boba tea fix here. Everyone here was friendly, social and helpful. I asked for a plastic container and the employee told me in very warm and friendly way that the to go boxes can hold liquid and assured me my leftovers will make it home. :) Overall, I had a pretty amazing experience here."
9/3/2022,3,"Nice to find a stir fried noodle dish with lots of veggies and protein, good for the family to share.Service took a bit longer and pricing seemed a little high. But overall, happy to find this place walkable from the Marriott Fort Lauderdale Airport hotel that we were staying at."
8/21/2022,3,"Located in Dania Point, this restaurant is nestled between Lime and In Ramen.  Upon entering, you can pick up a menu at the end of the line so you know what you want by the time it's your turn to order.  I ordered the Szechuan Chicken Bowl with fried rice.  I then took a seat at a table and waited approximately 5 minutes for the food. It arrived piping hot and the portion appeared to be large.  Besides chicken, there was an assortment of vegetables: zucchini, carrots, beans, etc.  The Szechuan flavor was not the greatest. However, the fried rice was amazing! The rice was actually the best part of the dish."
12/17/2022,1,"Food wrong twice for dine in, didn't receive my boba until we were completely finished, they literally gave me just plain salmon over rice and didn't add any sauce or toppings and said that is how the bowl comes lol. So bland and not enough food. Maybe the bento is good but the poke was awful."
7/28/2022,1,"I so very much wanted to love this place. I will give 5 stars to the young lady who rang me up and offered suggestions.5 stars to the warm white rice in the bento box but 1 star for the lukewarm/cold food. The tofu was fried/dried so much that it was edible. This was my first time so I do not know if this is the way that it is served. Total disappointment and waste of money. And it was not cheap either.It was nice that they have a sink for hand washing at the beverage station. I did not write this review right away since I contacted the ""we care share your experience"" website with no response as of today. :-("
3/4/2022,3,"I really want to give this location a great review, unfortunately it just is not consistent enough. When it hits it HITS but when it misses it misses. The Miami role is delicious! Always hits! The other options, order at your own risk. The green beans had little flavor even tho they were covered in garlic. Lo mein also had very little flavor despite having onions and carrots. Would come back only for the sushi"
12/9/2022,4,The BEST customer service and the sweetest staff. The only issue is the boba. The taro and the honey boba is quite literally the worst tasting boba I've ever had. The texture was as if they overcooked the pearls and the taste of the taro was way off. Definitely choose another flavor and don't get the pearls. I also tried the mango tea with lychee jelly it was DELICIOUS!
12/31/2021,4,Stopped in first time for lunch and ordered a bento sushi box with choice of rolls. I designate sushi as this place has both hot and cold boxes. I was very hungry so wanted the variety and quantity of items. This truly delivered very flavorful and fresh. When you go inside you order and they bring your order to your table. For this visit I chose outside since I was in need of fresh air as well as Covid free germs. Also I ordered a bottle of Fuji water which is my favorite. My two choices of rolls were Spicy Tuna and Mt. Fuji they had me at eel sauce made for a beautiful presentation I even had fellow diners ask what was I eating as the Mt. Fuji looks beautiful with the crab on top. Bento box is $15. well worth the price for a delicious lunch.
6/4/2022,5,"If you're in the mood for quick good Asian food, you can never go wrong with bento. The portions are pretty large and actually not that bad for the wallet. Definitely better than a Panda Express or a hole-in-the-wall Asian spot in my opinion. Bobas always taste fresh and delicious"
5/14/2022,3,"Three.5 stars  it's about right for this place it was not so bad... I don't have much to say but a couple of dishes we bought they are okay... Bento Box  it's pretty descent Noodle Bowl  wasn't bad... just lacked a flavor, Pao Pao chicken  2.5 stars"
5/22/2022,3,"I ordered their bento box to include prawns in a yellow curry. The portion is very generous. The salad had a very nice ginger dressing. The noodles were pleasant, the side green beans were also a hit. However, I was very disappointed in the yellow curry sauce, it seemed generic, globby and not particularly authentic in the taste, to be honest. The vegetables also seem to be thrown in from frozen, as they appeared watery. The prawns however were plentiful, large and cooked through. I would come again, but would NOT choose the yellow curry, but would try something else, maybe a stir fry."
3/2/2022,4,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was excited to see the restaurant was booming with business!For starters, the customer service was amazing and majority of the staff working there truly looked like they were enjoying themselves. In my eyes, that means the food is being prepared with attention and care! I came in and the incredible list of flavors and options were slightly intimidating, but with the help of one of the employees, I was recommended the Gochujang Garlic Chicken Bento Box which was super tasty. The Bento Box includes lo mein, your choice of white or brown rice, sautéed garlic green beans, a ginger salad and your choice of entree, mine being the Gochujang Garlic Chicken. The chicken was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy and also a hefty portion and the ginger salad was a mix of cucumber, cherry tomatoes and a proper salad mix with romaine. The other sides were just okay. Along with this, I ordered a Peach Green Boba Tea which was decent, nothing much to rave about and too sweet for my liking. Overall, a decent lunch option!"
5/22/2022,1,The food is to much greasy. Is a fast food asian food and is not cheapThe place was empty the service vas regular but the food is not goof
6/14/2021,3,"This is the 3rd location I've tried, and still... the one in Davie in the plaza with Home Depot near NOVA University is the best location hands down! Reason being... this place was empty, maybe 2 customers dining inside. My party and I sat outside and thete were tables that weren't cleaned or picked up. Ordered crab wontons. I don't think the employee who fried them knows how to drain off excess oil or even fried them at the right temperature because oil should not be pouring out of the wontons (see photos of oil in the plate and on a napkin). The employee at the register didn't know how to answer our menu questions and guessed answers lolI think from now on, I'll just stick to the Davie location."
11/16/2021,3,"Fast food sushi and poke bowls are ok by me.  Ended up eating here twice in a weekend because it was next to my hotel and 1) I love Poke, and 2) I was hungover often... so yeah this place was my cure.Easy ordering system - pay at the counter, you'll get a number and they'll bring it to your table.  And nice staff. I love places that have custom poke bowls, as well as some pre-set options as my mom isn't good at creating her own.  Portion size is pretty good for the price.  One complaint, the ice or drink machine is super loud, and, ok two complaints, I was always freezing inside."
12/11/2021,4,We ordered two orders of sushi and a noodle bowl. The sushi was fantastic!  Spicy tuna and Miami roll we're super delicious and fresh. The tuna was minced and mild tasting. The Miami roll had shrimp on top and crab inside. That roll was outstanding. The noodles were a little bit too saucy but the vegetables and noodles done to perfection. We sat outside on a beautiful night and enjoyed our meal. If I lived here I would definitely come back here.  Patio is spacious and lots of indoor seating. Wonderful menu good for families. Reasonable prices.
5/13/2022,1,"Found a dead bug in my poke bowl today. Didn't even receive a sorry when I called to let them know. Unfortunately it was a pick up order, so I didn't even realize it until I got home."
3/9/2021,4,"We'd been to the Bento in Boca (which is in an area of schools and business) and liked it. I'd read about this restaurant t chain from Howard H's yelp reviews. So when we saw this location, we figured we'd try it and compare. This smaller location is in a more locals and touristy area of Dania Pointe -- in a row of fast food restaurants.  We chose to eat inside as it was windy out, but there are outside tables, as well. You order and pay at the counter and they bring your food to your table. We'd tried their bento boxes at the other location. It was so much food that I decided to go with a smaller option. Howard had written about his usual dish and I decided to try it. I ordered the bowl with chicken katsu and Japanese curry. You can get it over rice or noodles. I wanted ramen, but they no longer offer them, so I chose lomein noodles. The other noodle option is udon which is fatter and wider. There was a lot of chicken in the dish. Each piece is panko battered and fried then cut into long wide strips. It was served on top of the spaghetti-like noodles. Mixed in to the seasoned noodles were some carrots. The curry was served on the side. It was slightly sweet and very very good. I can see why Howard always orders this. I wound up taking some of the chicken and curry sauce home for a later meal. My husband ordered their coconut red curry with added shrimp -- also as a bowl over noodles. There were a blend of vegetables mixed into the slightly spicy curry. And several shrimp on top. He also liked his dish as well. For fast casual Japanese food, this is really quite good. And the prices are also reasonable -- especially for the amount of food in each serving. We also received our meals fairly fast even though they were quite busy. Service was friendly although there was a bit of a language problem. I asked what was in a particular dish and the gal taking our order just kept repeating a memorized line over and over again. It was kind of funny, but I was trying to make sure nothing was in it that I might be allergic to and/or didn't like. Just to be sure, I ordered something else than I was originally going to get. That was the only minor glitch though. And yes, I'd certainly try them again when looking for an inexpensive fast food Japanese meal."
2/21/2021,4,"I visited this restaurant in the Boca location and always thought their food is good.  Since this new location in Dania Pointe just opened recently, I knew I had to pay a visit.In this visit, I came by to pick up a couple of lunch orders on a Friday.  I arrived around 11 am just after they had just opened the shop.  Maybe because they just recently opened so the staff had not finished preparing the food yet, I had to wait about 30 minutes to get my food.But I guess it was worth the wait.  My chicken katsu tasted great.  I ordered my chicken with Japanese Curry and it was delicious.  The rice was cooked right which was soft and fluffy.  My wife copied my order and she also enjoyed it very much.I'd probably come back maybe during the weekend because a 30-minute wait is just way too long on a working week.  They offer a large variety in their menu so I am sure I can probably pick up something else to enjoy."
3/22/2022,4,"I feel like a three star review is appropriate, though I am giving them a four star review o accommodating our large group for a local Bible study on a biweekly basis. The rolls are small but the fish seems to be quality and the taste is very good. I got the sushi box and was pleased with flavor, one star for portion. Maybe smaller sushi roll I've ever witnessed. Salad dressing and veggie dressing were both good. Great location and parking. Nice and spacious place. Beats other fast food options."
1/9/2021,3,"Yesterday was my second time getting lunch from Bento in Dania. The first time was through uber eats when I ordered a very underwhelming egg fried rice. This time around I placed a take out order through Yelp. It was super easy!I like how they have small orders of rolls so that way you can mix and match. I decided on the Mex Roll, the JB Roll and a chocolate milk tea.The JB roll was good. The salmon is smoked which is not my preference, but that's just a personal taste. I thought the Mex Roll was delicious and would return just for that.My total with tip was just over $17 which for sushi is not uncommon, however, the rolls were so incredibly tiny (size not amount of pieces). There are other sushi restaurants in the area that definitely give you more bang for your buck."
7/10/2022,1,"Don't give this place your money unless your extremely desperate and about to die from starvation. The service was beyond horrible, but what can you expect from a place that hires kids that probably already don't make shit. The sushi that I ordered tasted exactly the same. I also ordered the boba and I was super excited to try the boba.... that was disappointing. If I could give a negative five star review I would."
10/25/2022,3,"MID BOBA, Boba was not good. tapioca is made terrible, and FOUR DOLLARS FOR FRIED RICE, the gentrifiers have done it again. (Food was pretty alright though). WIPB( Jack, Luc, Jeff)"
8/31/2022,5,"Needed a quick lunch with a business partner. We  both did like the quality and portion of the food, the service, and the cleanliness.  I checked the bathroom and felt completely confident to eat there."
7/23/2021,1,"I should have known better than to call in an order at 10pm when they closed at 10:30pm, but I really wanted a veggie roll. When I walked in the pick up the order, they were obviously cleaning for closing or sitting in their phones. Of course that weren't happy about me being there so late, I know I know. But the veggie roll tasted like everything in it was expired, down to the cream cheese. I ate 2 pieces and spit the 3rd one out, fearing that I may get sick. The color of the veggies were a bit off as well. The spring roll was still good though.I will stick to the Davie location moving forward, as I never have a problem there."
5/8/2022,1,"insanely slow service and borderline rudeone girl up front trying to work both the register with a long line, while also making the boba teas.  meanwhile the other staff is barely moving"
7/4/2022,5,"Had the lava roll ,which is basically like a volcano sushi roll, and  red curry chicken bowl. Both were very good !!"
7/10/2022,5,"Great great food everything was super fresh and clean, the  ginger salad  the service super fast"
4/15/2022,1,"Forgot about one of our orders - we waited 2 HOURS for some sushi rolls (easiest thing to make) & reminded them MULTIPLE times. obviously they have no management. (Paid OVER $66 - for a terrible experience. Might as well take your money somewhere else)They kept messing up everyone's orders and mixing up peoples meals, it's a huge mess. Food is subpar - compared to other bentos when I order the same thing. They put two people with the same order number - so our food was left sitting there getting cold unless we got up and went back inside to ask where's our food?? They finally put two and two together. Than waited even more time (over an hour or 2) to get a simple box of sushi. They also made us wait an hour for a boba tea order - once we got it it was all watered down. So what was the point of waiting? It's not like they made anything better with their ""special ingredient"" that they made us wait for. Don't let the new fancy location fool you - they suck might as well go somewhere else where they know how to at least train their employees correctly.They also have no manners (when you're nice to them and polite) they just maintain a straight face ,Throw you your food and don't care. I understand times are tough - but ethically you need to take any job you take in a high regard if that's the job in which you applied for."
4/18/2021,1,"This review is written on behalf of my bf who had an unpleasant experience here. Months ago, we came here together and ALSO didn't have a great experience considering that our food took longer than it should. The manager (an older gentleman) gave us a free drink card that night.Fast forward, my bf came recently came and claimed the drink and ordered a sushi roll for lunch. Upon arrival, he was not greeted. A girl at the front, Angelina, just blatantly stared at him. He took it upon himself to ask ""hello, how are you?"" And still, no response. She still doesn't say a word nor ask how he can be helped. As he orders, this girl gives major attitude and presses buttons on the screen really hard. When asking her what his options are, she continued to stay mute and points at it. And when she did speak, it seems like she's purposely mumbling so she can't be heard. Upon reviewing of what he ordered, she still tried to charge him for the drink. Overall, she was rude. So many things went wrong at this point, and clearly we are clueless on where the customer service is? And HOW this is kind of behavior is acceptable?My bf doesn't ever complain about anything like this but he felt like this experience could've been prevented. He even asked someone at the meal prep station if he could speak to the manager and waited AGAIN, longer than he should. He had to remind them a second time to bring a manager out. Nevertheless, the manager (Maria) was useless. She didn't seem to know what she was doing or clearly how to handle the situation. Not really apologetic to what took place, and was more defensive with her staff. Not everyone can provide excellent customer service, but AT LEAST have decent manners. Not sure how a business can operate with people who can't even do a simple task of greeting their guests, let alone helping with their order."
1/18/2022,1,Maybe not the best place.  At the end of the day is my opinion so give this place a try at your own risk. From 1-10 I'll give this place a 3. Miso soup was watery no flavor. The The noodles on my bento was cold. The protein was great. Hospitality was fair. Environment was ok. For me was disappointing.
5/16/2022,1,Ordered a poke bowl online and found it sitting on the counter when I walked in. Poke bowls have raw fish in them... Had food poisoning for three days straight after. I hope somebody from health department pays them a visit soon.
4/17/2022,1,"Disgraceful service. Cashiers need to be trained on how to deal with customers. While I wait d an ETERNITY for my order, I gave up after 20 min and asked to speak with a manager. The ENTIRE staff at the restaurant had no idea where the manager was and were surprised to find out that the manager had abruptly quit. I got my refund and advised customers behind me NOT to eat at this establishment. Was a sad site to see all the confusion between the line cooks and prep staff. This establishment needs serious help! Will never EVER eat or order food from here EVER AGAIN!"
9/19/2021,1,"Son, I am disappoint... very, very disappoint.This is essentially cheap, conveyor belt 70s Chinese kitchen takeout slop, just re-marketed and repackaged with a more updated look/feel. If it has an app, it must be different! Completely bland and uninspired. Fresh but not flavorful or memorable at all. Seems like cheap GFS kind of  stuff. The decor, location and website/app market it out to be a lot nicer than what you get. Its not bad, really, just meh. I literally could have taken my family to the Chinese buffet down the street for 1/3 the cost, and it really would have tasted better. I don't have a problem paying premium prices for premium fast food. But this just doesn't cut it. They say gen Z is more about the 'experience' but come on, even they have to realize this is just rebranded 70s slop, just without the flavor.The staff and modern decor were great. The rest.... Stick to the MSG... seriously..."
3/13/2021,3,"Man it pains me to give this place 3 stars. This was my fave fast casual asian dining in college- the Pao Pao (spicy creamy) chicken bowl is incredible. People literally flew it to me when I left college and lived in MD. But I've been 6 times now and have had something wrong with my order EVERY time. Expect it to take longer than 30 min whether you dine in or order ahead. Only one of six times was it ready under the 20 min mark. There are some issues from the online ordering site to what prints out for the kitchen. A couple of examples- I ordered lo mein and got a side of plain udon noodles, I said no mushrooms and there were mushrooms, I asked for a side of veggies and there was no side of veggies....it goes on. Check your order before you leave!! Once I ordered it on ubereats. They even managed to send me the wrong persons food! When I called them, they recognized their mistake and asked if I could come in to pick up the correct food because Uber had already closed the order. If ANY other place had this many issues I would not go back. But that Pao Pao sauce is worth the eye rolls, and it's a great price point. So I say go, but know what you're getting into! Or maybe try another Florida location because I've never had issues like this with any of the others!"
1/11/2021,3,"If I had to choose between Pei Wei, Panda Express, or Bento... I'm not entirely sure I'd pick Bento. I think that it's great they offer quick and convenient Asian-style food, and they even offer inexpensive sushi. The sushi, however, is all I enjoyed of my meal. The red curry with tofu was kind of tragic. I know that's harsh, but wow, so was the taste of the curry. The noodles with chicken that I got were absolutely swimming in sauce. I don't even remember what I got because I just remember the abundance of sauce. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back. I'd just strictly get sushi."
9/13/2022,2,This place is vile. Fast food sushi garbage. Fish previously frozen. Bland is a compliment. The rice is like glue. The miso soup is like sipping on salt. Straight up disgusting. Will never go back!
3/6/2022,2,I love the Bento place in Davie and this one was a disappointment. For the high price for fast food sushi it did not meet the standards. Salad was yucky and the pickle salad had no flavor. The rolls were tiny tiny. I will not be coming back to I should of taken a picture of my rolls.
2/15/2022,2,$66 dollars last Friday with my family ... kids meal had peppers in it and my orange chicken was brown in the inside . I didn't know they were going to use dark meat . Disappointed especially for the price .
11/25/2020,1,"We ordered 2 poke bowls for pickup, long wait when we arrived, mass chaos with their team members trying to figure out orders. They just opened so that is completely understandable. However in one of our bowls we found this, not sure what it attached to the cream cheese but we didn't want to find out and threw away both bowls. I tried reaching out to them through email and social media 2 weeks ago and have not received a response. So here's your 1 star review."
8/19/2022,2,I gave this restaurant two Stars only because of the cleanliness. Normally this place would have received a one star if that. Let me start with a warning. If you order chicken and it tastes like fish looks like fish and the staff tries to convince you that it's not fish you should really consider was this the right restaurant choice. My wife had Pad Thai with shrimp I'm not sure who came up with this Chef inspired idea of adding barbecue sauce to Pad Thai but it just doesn't work. You know the food is bad when you place it on the back of your tongue to try to avoid the taste of it. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy and I absolutely hate him.
10/16/2021,5,This is my second location that I have tried & I am not disappointed. Food is always hot and tasty & They make accommodation for specific requests. Great team of workers that are very personable & professional. Worth stopping by if you are in the area.
10/3/2021,5,I wish I can give this place 100 stars... Food is absolutely delicious... And the prices are incredible... friendly and quick service!! EXCELLENT!!!
4/1/2022,5,"To these other people leaving reviews, just get directly to the point! Stop, dragging it out and making us all have to read your long ass paragraphs!"
4/29/2021,3,"I love Bento on Davie, but this location made me sad. It's FREEZING cold inside. The wait time was a little ridiculous. Next time I will order online. I ordered 4pcs Special Mex sushi and I don't think that warranted a 30 minute wait. Then when I got my food it was wrong, so they had to make the correct order. The cashier was really nice and helpful."
9/14/2021,1,"This bento blows. I paid $23 for sesame chicken on teriyaki Tuesday because they ran out of teriyaki chicken at 5pm. So I decided to go with the sesame chicken.  Honestly the food at Asian chao in sawgrass looks way better and that's $8.  I also ordered miso soup and garlic edamame, both horrible as well. The edamame has no taste and the miso smells like cat piss and Tastes just as bad. If you would like my business please reach out to me as I will not come back to this restaurant only the one in davie as they know how to make a great meal. The owner should really be ashamed to serve such low quality food under a great name like bento."
1/17/2022,2,"Bento is a hit or miss. I've come here several times hoping to have a better experience. The chicken here is often chewy/stringy and hard to consume. I've heard their noodles are good, but I do not recommend the chicken. The takeout is not as good as dine in."
5/14/2021,5,"First of all this place has good food, we like it and come regularly. To actually have Pad Thai that uses rice noodles instead of the wheat or partially wheat noodles is great and much healthier and gluten free. But this tendency for small businesses or any business attempting to create their own little fiefdoms concerning government regulations is completely unacceptable. Mobs don't make the rules.The mask mandates across the country during the pandemic were totally unenforceable and had no legislation of any kind backing them. It was simply accepted by the masses thru the spreading of fear, easily half of which was carried out by the media. We are a nation of laws and though it was acceptable to wear masks for a time while this horrible disease was spreading we've reached the other side of it now. It's over!The government and its various medical entities instituted the precaution and have done so before in other pandemics, but again without the backing of law. The CDC DHS and WHO having no enforcement capabilities of any kind. The government started it now the government has ended what they started, nobody else has anything to say about it. The fact that businesses are attempting to force such things upon the citizens of this country is not their business - and it is unlawful.People should get back to the business of minding their own business, which is to conduct business. Not continue to mob others with the mob-rule, of insisting that you do what they want you to because they feel like it. Everyone has feelings, and feelings are not law, and their feelings are none of my business. When they are forced it makes for bad business, forcing things you shouldn't always does that. Customer service has always been a big deal in this country. Good eateries near good hotels have long been considered part of the hospitality industry, not hospital.But we do like their food! When they stop the bully tactics of forcing their customers to do something their business has no control over and no legal backing for - we'll like them too :-) Thank you miss Maria, sister Lyne and the cooks. The yellow and red curries are also amazing. Such dishes remind me of Cocos Curry House in Japan."
12/15/2021,5,I'm one of those pesky vegans who thinks he's better than you. Jk. Seriously though as a vegan I got the spicy crispy vegan tofu in a poke bowl and it was outstanding. I enjoyed it enough to leave this review so that should mean something. My friend got a bowl of murdered animals and rice and thoroughly enjoyed it as well.
10/16/2021,5,This Bento located in Dania Pointe is by far one of the best locations I've ever been  their staff is super friendly and the food is always GREAT! Love their atmosphere and everything about this place.
7/26/2022,1,"Every time I come here I'm disappointed. The food is trash quality for the price. And the employees are not only rude but dont care about any type of professionalism. As I'm standing waiting for food there are people ignoring incoming tickets, on their cell phones, and blatantly ignored me when I walked in. I asked the girl up front how much for an extra sauce she said it was free. When I grabbed my food I asked for an additional one (thinking if it's free it doesn't matter) and the person who I asked snapped back with a disgusting attitude. Definitely do waste your time and money. This was me trying to give them one last chance as I work in the same plaza and was hungry on my way into work. Next time I'll starve."
5/20/2021,2,Was disappointed to see a cleaning staff member clean the floor with a rag and then went on to use the same rag to wipe down all the tables.. Dude! That's like using your mop to clean of your dinning table! How could she not know that was not acceptable .. yuck!
9/30/2021,5,"When it comes to Asian food I'm very picking about where I eat. I really like bentos I've tried a few locations  in the past but this is by far the only one worth driving for.The food is  always fresh and made to perfection !  I   Have  never been disappointed. the place is very clean , and also  Maria  the manager is very kind and personable , she has a great team of employees that are also attentive and friendly."
11/13/2021,2,"Ordered the Florida roll and rice veggie bowl. The roll was okay, nothing special, and the bowl was not good. The rice was under cooked and the veggies over cooked. The tofu was so hard and burned I couldn't chew it and I did not enjoy the flavor of the bowl."
9/6/2021,1,"The worst bento we've been to!! I've been to many locations and normally really like it. We walk in and everything is dirty, the tables have old food on them. We order and every single employee is rude. We sit down after moving tables because it was so sticky and our food was missing something so my husband asked about it and the employee literally said ""ask someone else"" while continuing whatever he was doing. Not worth it. Drive to a different location or go somewhere else."
8/21/2021,1,"Worst Asian food I've ever had.  Tried their food twice and the quality is shameful.  The Thai Fried rice tasted like it has been in a refrigerator for over a week, the vegetables were hard, stale like and only ate one shrimp.  When I felt like I was going to vomit I threw the entire thing in the trash.  Stomach started hurting and now I'm drinking ginger, tumeric and peppermint tea.  There will NOT be a third time.  In fact in my opinion, the health department might want to pay the Dania Beach location a visit to make sure they are following proper protocol when it comes to food storage, handling and safety."
2/21/2021,2,"SLOW SLOW SLOW food ... Before us, after us ... EVERYONE was waiting too too long for our food. Management needs to get on the ball. This is NOT an employee problem. Unacceptable a fast casual establishment. #neveragain"
7/9/2021,5,Great food! Amazing customer service. I love the young people working and showing leadership. I will certainly be back!
4/16/2022,3,"This chain of restaurants does not accept cash. This was not a deal breaker for me but off the bat deters some potential customers. I had the bowl with Lowe mein, vegetables and tofu. The tofu was dried up around the edges and too tough to eat. The rest of the food was so-so. When I asked one of their employees said they had no paper plates. There was a stack of cardboard soup bowls right in front of him. This place was not a horrible experience but I on the other hand wasn't positive enough to especially bring me back either."
3/9/2021,3,Food was okay. Nothing wow. Lo mein noodles with steak were so so. The sushi rolls were small and tasted okay. Probably will only go back for take-out when I don't want to cook.
2/18/2022,5,"Would highly commend there customer service. The orange chicken that I ordered was not up to their usual standard. The manager ,Angela, not only had my order remade also gave me a gift card which goes above and beyond in my opinion. I will be coming back."
11/22/2020,5,"So glad Bento is finally open at Dania Pointe!Visited during their soft opening and had great service and amazing food. We got edamame, orange chicken and lo mein, pad Thai, and taro boba. Everything was absolutely delicious!! Obviously, employees are still training so please be patient. Everyone seemed excited to be there and attentive to everything going on. Unfortunately the dining room was closed when we went so we had to eat outside but the inside is so nice and modern! Can't wait for this to become a go to spot for me :)"
4/11/2021,1,My first time at this location and it is extremely sub par compared to all the other bentos. All the four people I was with had mistakes on there orders and they weren't even busy. The boba tea took 30 minute. If you want bento save yourself the headache and do not come to this location.
5/15/2021,2,"This place seems to have a constant problem with getting their orders out within a reasonable time frame. After waiting 30 minutes for a simple sushi roll I asked the staff how much longer the wait would be and was told multiple times that my roll was being made. It wasn't until I reached the 45 minute mark that I had to ask for a manager and she informed me that the roll had not even been started yet. If you're looking for a dining experience with multiple guests I advise you to choose another restaurant as this location will serve everyone's order at a different time (one of my guests orders came out in 10 minutes, another in 30 and mine almost after 50 minutes). There needs to be more clear communication between the staff and from the staff to the customer. Also, I gave two stars as the food itself is nothing crazy, definitely not anything worth waiting 50 min for."
5/30/2021,2,"I have been to the Bento Box in Davie, which was a very unsatisfying experience. It took 30 minutes to get our cold food. Well I took my daughter to the Dania Pointe one and once again I was upset when I left. I paid 47.60 with a tip you give before you even sit down. The first picture is my meal. I had brown rice,garlic green beans,ginger salad,garlic broccoli with shrimp which adds 1.50 to the meal. Let's start out with the broccoli was way undercooked. Second the noodles that are supposed to be hot and have taste were cold and flavorless. Third I asked the lady that delivered our food was the green beans supposed to be cold? She looked a little stunned and told me ""well they are supposed to be warm"" and walked away!!! The only good thing was the pork gyoza that was nice and hot. My daughter got the. Fried chicken katsu which was piping hot and delicious. I will not try a third time. You can see by the pictures what is good."
12/21/2021,3,"3 stars: The Mt Fuji roll is amazing! but the general tso had the shells still on the shrimp so the entire meal, my family and I were constantly spitting them out. Rice was bland and mushy."
5/14/2021,5,Hands down the best service! We were looking for a quick bite to eat before a trip. Lyné was quick and efficient with getting our order. Food taste amazing. We definitely come here for a quick bite.
8/10/2021,1,Such a terrible experience. Our meals were all wrong. When I came back in the woman Mananger was so unhelpful instead of correcting it. She was worried about charging .50 for a sauce they forget to put in the bag. Never got to eat what we ordered. $46.00 lunch wasted. Even tried to give the woman .50 cash and said she couldn't take it so we never got to get the sauce. What terrible customer service. Stay clear of this location.
12/13/2020,5,"Happy to see Bentos is opening up multiple locations! I first tried them in Tallahassee, fl. This location was new and clean with minimal wait considering it was a Sunday early in the day. I ordered online a kids sweet sour chicken, the bento sushi combo box, a poke bowl and a crunch roll. All was delicious and a great meal for a good price. I made my first poke bowl today and the freshness of ingredients did not dissapoint! Great spot to drop in when you are out and about shopping at dania pointe or in town looking for a quick fix!"
5/1/2021,5,Bento is amazing! I was so excited for it to open at Dania Pointe and it was well worth the wait. The food is excellent and the staff are very helpful and kind. I love the Mongolian chicken bowl and the poke salad (which you can customize). My mom tried the egg rolls and said those were very tasty as well. The portions here are great and service is pretty quick. I've been multiple times since it's opened and Bento has been consistently good! This is my new favorite spot for delicious and reasonably priced Asian food!
2/13/2021,1,"Extremely disappointed with service and food. Waited one hour for the food, asked 2 times and they keep saying that it was almost ready. Keep in mind the place was empty ( now I know why)  and I only ordered 2 plates and 2 appetizers. They did not care one bit, neither said sorry. when the food came it was cold. This was my first time and will be my last time. Do not recommend."
4/18/2021,5,Got a couple things from here tonight. Staff was awesome! Food was great! Will be coming back for sure.
5/21/2021,5,"The Sushi Combination Box at Bento can't be beat... great options, great flavor, great value! When I asked for extra pickled ginger, the customer service was fantastic! Special shout-out to Juan and Senya for going above and beyond to make today's lunch experience as great as it was!"
5/11/2021,4,"The TNT roll was so delicious! The right balance of smokey and spicy. Our 3y old loved the kids chicken teriyaki so much we had to order him a 2nd one. Also, the garlic edamame was awesome! Will definitely be back!"
3/9/2021,3,They make very good rolls but the service is pretty slow. Hopefully they'll get better over time.
1/30/2021,1,"I'm giving this one star because if you compare this store to the Davie store it's like they are not even the same company. I place an order over the phone they tell me 20 min which is no problem . The problem comes when they have one cashier and my food is sitting at the counter getting cold . So now I have to wait for one cashier to take care of a line of 9 people in front of me . Mind you I was already waiting 10 min for the cashier to take 2 people's order . I ask is there another way to pay I'm told no to wait in the line , see ya later I'm not waiting .Every time I come to this location there always seems to be a problem . This store will not be getting my business again."
5/7/2021,4,The food is really good and consistently good.  The rolls are flavorful and fresh.  Give it a try! I only gave them 4 stars due to you have to consistently wait a long time for the food and one of the reasons i sometimes choose to go somewhere else for takeout when i'm in DP.
7/13/2021,3,"So I always go to the bento in davie tower shops and it's the best. This location is convenient because I had just left the gym. Idk what it is, but the taro milk tea and the boba is so gross at this location. I switched it for the thai tea and it wasn't that good either. Also, I got the Szechuan shrimp rice and wasn't that good either :( also the shrimp weren't properly cleaned. Very disappointing."
3/28/2021,5,"Great prices, great food, never a bad meal. I love it, come here all the time.Orange Chicken"
12/5/2020,4,"My son and I are big time  poke bowl fans, but they can be pricey. We checked this place out in Dania pointe on their official grand opening day. My son thought his poke bowl was one of the best he's ever had (granted, I don't usually take him to the high end poke places...hello...pricey!....lol) but he still has had enough that he can tell the difference between not fresh and fresh. I didn't love mine as much but that was because I found the poke soy sauce to not go well with the greens I chose (instead of rice). The portions were quite large. I had a regular build your own and was impressed with how much tuna I got for about $12. The two rolls we had (spicy tuna and Japanese) were pretty good too. The employees were super friendly and attentive. Bottom line: it's a fast food type sushi and poke place, so don't expect amazing, but for the price and convenience, I can definitely say it will be a new go-to in the neighborhood."
2/12/2021,2,"Took 30+ minutes for take out and the food was luke warm, spring rolls cold in the middle.  Good idea, poor execution."
12/19/2020,3,"Online ordering was very smooth and easy, including a place for a special instructions, which I really appreciate. EDIT: I've ordered a few times now, and my special requests regarding the food were totally ignored. And we're talking easy, like ""no lettuce"".) Easy to customize your order by clicking boxes next to which ingredients you want to omit, or in some cases, add. Delivery was fast, and the driver did follow the special instructions. Delivery is by Door Dash.Portion size was decent, but the recipes are wrong wrong wrong. Whoever wrote the recipe for their bulgogi has never eaten it and has no idea what it should taste like. On another dish, the spicy mayo was sweet, which it shouldn't be, and there was too much of it. It would be nice if the ingredients were indicated, like what the noodles are made out of. Oh, and there's a box to check on the online ordering if you don't want utensils, so I checked it, but I got utensils anyway.I really wanted to like this place because it is close and it's very easy to order online, but this isn't even close to Asian cuisine."
11/23/2020,5,"Absolutely amazing food. We've had rolls and a poky bawl. Both were excellent. Boba tea has a bit much sugar for my taste, but I usually get 0, so that's not really a complain. Fast service as well. It's a gem that not many ppl know about yet."
3/27/2021,5,"We just finished eating our meal, we had it delivered via UberEats. Everything was so freaking tasty! I was so pleasantly surprised. I got the poke bowl, and I added string beans AMAZING  I wish I had more. Will definitely order again."
3/26/2021,1,Worst customer service! I ordered online during the day (around 11:50 am). My food said it would be ready for pickup at 12:20. I got to the restaurant early and it was empty. It took the staff about 10 minutes to even ask me for my name and what I was waiting on. There was literally no one there in the restaurant BUT it still took them an additional almost half an hour to prepare and have my food ready. Totally ridiculous. Save your time and go to the other restaurants at Dania Pointe that have far better service and food. My recommendation would be to go in InRamen rather than Bento.
11/13/2020,5,"Just went two days ago, so glad this place finally opened. It's a great addition to the stores in the plaza. The staff were super friendly, and the food was quick and it felt very safe, everyone was waiting for their takeout apart from others. Ordered for a few people so we got a vegetarian sushi roll, mini poke bowl, fried rice, and tofu pad Thai. Only downside the noodles for pad Thai can't be subbed for egg noddles as they are premartinated. Definitely will come back soon."
9/17/2021,2,"Good food but don't come here unless you have a lot of time and patience. It took 5 minutes of me standing at the counter for someone to come take my order. I waited 30 minutes for a simple veggie stir fry. And no... it's not crowded at all... only three tables are occupied. Unfortunately every time I have come here that has been the case. Again, food has been fine but not worth the long wait."
9/15/2021,5,This has become a regular spot for me to grab lunch or dinner. The service is always very welcoming and the food is always freshly made. Lyne is super helpful and has a great attitude. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a great experience.
12/14/2020,1,I have visited a handful of time at this location and every single time they take forever to deliver an order. This is the last time that I come to this location. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE.
7/24/2021,2,"Loved the location on University but the traffic is crazy in that area so we thought we'd try the Dania shop. Food was good but it took 45 minutes to get it despite there being very few people in the place. We thought we'd try again in case that was a bad day, and bc we love the food. Got there right at opening time, and the employees studiously ignored us. Did not even speak, so we left. The place needs better management, I think."
5/16/2021,4,"After speaking to the manager, Maria, we are assured that we are making right decision by continuing to come here since we love the concept. We love the atmosphere of Dania Pointe.  We were greeted tonight with a much better attitude.  First, the manager, Maria recognized us and went out of her way to see that we were satisfied.  The cashier that usually waits on us, Lia, has a dynamic personality is enthusiastic and very personable.  Usually I do not take one experience and paint the entire landscape and that would not suffice for tonight.  We had the usual experience we were accustomed to the first two times we visited prior to the last one.  The one thing is the food is consistent and very good quality.  I don't know if tonight was like the others because we visited much earlier than arriving one hour prior to closing and being told we are closing soon.  We will be back, thank you, Maria and Lia for your thoughtfulness!"
5/15/2021,2,Very disappointed.  First time I've been to a bento since pandemic and first time at this location.  Ordered 2 poke bowls to go.  First bad experience was they were out of the sesame green beans.  7 o'clock on a Saturday night.  How can you be out of something like that?  Got home to find one of the poke bowls completely wrong.  Things left out that I ordered and things added that I didn't order. It's not that difficult to take an order at the register.  If you can't get it right then don't offer build your own.  I used to love bento as a less expensive option on the nights I didn't feel like paying the higher prices at all the other sushi restaurants.  Going to take some convincing to give them another shot.
7/25/2021,5,"I love this place!! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great and the workers are amazing! I work in customer service so I know how hard it is to constantly be giving to customers, I was eating there last night and even when they were cleaning up, getting ready to close Juan and Barbara and even another woman that took my trash, sadly I could not get her name, were so kind to me to get me another straw for my bubble tea, I could tell how tired they were and they still treated me so nicely I had to write this review. Thank you so much, this is my favorite place to eat in the whole area!"
6/29/2021,5,Best location workers are always friendly and outgoing and food is great. wok fried rice is the best
5/14/2021,5,"Had the most wonderful experience at this location in Dania. At the shopping center getting my nails done and decided to get a late lunch, I'm very glad I did. It was fresh, hot and delicious! I was warmly greeted by Lyne' and the whole staff. Sat in the restaurant to eat for the first time since COVID (usually have food delivered to my house) because it was so clean and inviting. Keep up the fantastic work Lyne' and I'll be back very soon!"
5/14/2021,5,I came to Bentos with my wife and kids for the first time today. Ive worked in several restaurants in my life time and i can honestly say i have never experienced better customer service and professionalism from anyone other than Lyne (hopefully im spelling that right). She  is an outstanding representative for Bentos and you should be very great full for having her.
8/12/2021,1,"I came for the first time, I've heard good things so I was excited to try. This is a new location, and when I showed up, they were out of rice. How is an Asian restaurant place out of rice? When I saw a big cat of rice come from the kitchen, I asked the manager why I couldn't get rice when I saw it there. She had a bad attitude and said it was the sushi rice not the normal rice. She then proceeded, with an attitude, how they had a limited menu sign up that explained everything. She was speaking to me in a very rude manner, where I had to ask her to not speak to me that way as a customer. To a normal customer, limited menu means they are out of a small menu item, not the main ingredient in all dishes. She then proceeds to tell me they are out of milk tea, after I ordered and the cashier proceed to check to make sure they had milk tea. At that point, I asked for a total refund because I did not want to give them any business . If I could give a place 0 stars I would, they had terrible customer service."
5/10/2021,2,"Only putting two stars because they used to be good. Ever since they made the price $10 for a mini poke bowl they put less portioning. On top of that, our order is always wrong. We used to come here all the time my wife and I. But since they've been so inconsistent it's been more of a chore to order from them, really bad service went down hill as of five to seven months ago."
2/8/2021,1,When they first opened they were amazing but over time the food has gotten tasteless and weak. The past 2 times I've ordered from bento the presentation and quaility of the food has decreased tremendously. Don't get me wrong I know it's no high end Chinese food but some more seasoning won't hurt. Save your money and just get your neighborhood Chinese food because this isn't worth the price
2/19/2021,3,Stopped here wanting a quick to go lunch on my way back to work. Ordered a roll nothing unusual. Service at 2pm was unbelievably slow and none of the staff seemed to be picking up slack.  Only 2-3 tables of people dining so not sure what the hold up is. At least a 30 minute wait for a roll...
4/13/2021,5,Every time we dine in the food and customer service is amazing!! Lyné is always super helpful and never rushes my order!
2/26/2021,2,service is poor and slow and they push up into giving a tip when you order. It is self service so why are are you tiping? Food is just ok .The price ok.
11/22/2020,5,The food is amazing! Customer service was great. Very friendly very clean. Food was fresh. Wayyyyyyy better then Panda Express! Way better. I will be back! I couldn't post any photos because I ate whole entire plate
11/27/2020,2,"Food quality was really poor, overall way too expensive for the quality. Really wished I explored other options.  I've had better Asian food from my local Chinese food store. Would not recommend."
11/23/2020,5,I love this spot. The Japan bagel roll is amazing! The service is great and everything I've tried on the menu is good.
1/9/2021,1,"First off, we did feel safe. It wasn't busy, and now we know why. The food, just awful!  Appetizers consisted of a very stale, old, seaweed salad, and box store crab rangoon.Ehhhhhh  Dinner, was mongolian chicken bento box. Watered down ginger dressing, cold rice, and bland chicken. I did not finish one item. Every food court in the entire country has better chinese food than this place.  Pass on by folks."
5/31/2021,5,i ordered the red curry tofu on udon noodles it was extremely amazing. it was recommended to me by the cashier abby she was extremely helpful in navigating the menu and any questions i had. i would most definitely recommend
1/8/2021,1,literally drove all the way just for them to say no cash and did nothing to help terrible service.
8/29/2022,4,"Service was great for such a ""fast casual"" dining experience. The food is good and it's quick and easy. I'd come here again because their poke tasted fresher than most fast casual restaurants and they were very attentive to our table."
9/23/2022,4,"Noodle Bowl with Pao Pao Chicken had a great flavor, big portion size, grabbed a Togo box to bring the rest home. The Rice Bowl with sesame chicken and shrimp is delicious and satisfying. Ufff the Veggie Spring Rolls were perfectly crispy and light, definitely a must!"
2/6/2022,3,"I wanted to give Bento another try, so my husband and I picked up some meals to eat at home. The emoyees who helped us were very nice and the restaurant was very clean but I'm afraid the food just wasn't very good.  This time I had the Mangolian beef with lo mein and my husband had the beef szechuan with white rice. To begin with, the quality of beef just didn't taste very good, more like a cheaper cut of meat. The veggies were good and the lomein was good but there was a lot of oil in the bottom of my bowl. My husband's meal was just ok, nothing special and mostly rice. That being said, I really wanted to like this place but I know I definitely won't be going back."
12/13/2022,5,Staff is welcoming and nice. Food is fresh and never taste like it's been sitting out. Place is clean and well kept
1/23/2022,3,"This location is a little different then the other two I've been to. I can't put my finger in it but it may be the layout? Very interesting for them to basically open during the pandemic so that's a factor too. It was mainly all delivery at first of my memory serves me correctly. Pretty scarce every time I go in there. The location in Davie is always booming, but of course it's next to Nova U. I gave this Bento three stars because it was not particularly fantastic nor was it particularly terrible. Somewhere in the middle. Service wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful. I think it has been a while since I've been somewhere like this-- just in the middle somewhere. Not much to it Lol you order, you eat and you go home. *shrugs* just a quick takeaway meal. I ate inside and took the rest home for leftovers. I would still recommend because they have some cool menu items that have me in a chokehold. Ie the pao pao chicken over udon noodles and the Mexican roll."
5/30/2022,3,"Mixed review.The Good - Location is easy to find on Pines boulevard in new strip mall w/ plenty of parking.Food was fresh, sushi roll & Hawaii Poke bowl portions were good. New location had decent decor & audio system & music.    The Bad - Counter person not very helpful for first time customer, & not providing suggestions to get thru the many food options.NO cash accepted !?!?Very large staff on duty but service was rather slow, even though the location not that busy. No low sodium soy sauce available in the condiments section Food was salty and wife got illPortion large with white rice, but could of used more protein. Prices are on the high side $70 for 2 ppl lunch (No alcohol) in this fast casual restaurant Benton staff rushed in & jump the line, left the restroom very dirty even though they knew it was in need of service."
12/19/2021,1,"Everything is cross contaminated then VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS BE AWAREWent to bento tonight and I had one shrimp on my food, I am ALLERGIC to shrimp. I stopped eating right away and call them I spoke to a manager and she stated ""oh well you always have to tell us about the allergies so we can wipe the wall off completely"" the phone conversation went on for 6 min, she went on about the signs they have ok cool, so I'm like ""so can I eat my bfs fried rice or is that also contaminated?"" She answered ""unfortunately it is cross contaminated you need to inform us"" so I went on saying that then the cashiers should ask each customer about allergies. This is unacceptable, I used to come to this location all the time, I am highly disappointed. This is NOT ok.Today I went to get my refund, the manager Angela (she said they don't give out last names) spoke to me and I was telling her that it was unacceptable that there was a shrimp there, she said ""it is the persons responsibility to tell us their allergies"" I went on ""I've been to this location since I was in college never had a problem, so you're saying all of your food is cross contaminated?"" She said ""unfortunately you have to inform us."" This is unacceptable because i read the menu and if it doesn't have shrimp I don't say I am allergic. Overall dissatisfied with the lack of empathy and urgency. I work in the Health care field and EVERYONE should be aware of this. There should be signs on the register that say this. Also if everything is cross contaminated then VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS BE AWARE they cook everything without cleaning."
12/22/2021,3,"OK this place is pass for me which I hardly ever say. I went here wanting to experience something new and I did however it wasn't that great. The veggie roll was extremely small, as in I thought it was an appetizer or that I received the wrong order. I took a picture of it and shared it. It was literally the length and width of my thumbnail. No one greeted us upon entry, there were no menus to be found anywhere. And because they didn't greet us they were unaware that it was our first time there so we had no idea what the ordering process was. We had to call out to someone for assistance because they were all engaged in other activities. We also had to ask where the menus were because there weren't any posted up or on the tables. The food was plated/boxed nicely but lacked flavor and it was expensive. If you are a true sushi eater or sushi roll connoisseur this will not be your place. This is more for willing to pay the price for a not so quick bite of non traditional rolls. I would say this is fast food sushi. With that being said I will say that the bowl and bento box had a lot of flavor. If anything stick to the those items. This is not your sushi stop. My mom order the crispy roll which was actually the normal size of a sushi roll and she was also disappointed due to the lack of flavor. It was supposed to be a seared salmon crunchy roll.Stick to the bowls and the Bento boxes. I believe those are their strong points."
2/5/2022,1,"Legal tender is a form of money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt. Each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender, but essentially it is anything which when offered in payment of a debt extinguishes the debt.   Imagine two years into the pandemic, you go to buy your dinner I'm at the end of ordering you're telling you that you can't pay with cash they are not accepting cash! Shake my head do better"
8/23/2022,1,#1 Food no good #2 Hygiene no good long hair people serving and makings food#3price 3 order.   71.96$
11/12/2021,5,"This place is my go to always!The spicy cream chicken aka Pao Pao is the absolute best thing ever. I cannot order anything else or stay away from that sauce. It takes the bento box or rice bowl or noodle bowl to another level. They do also have amazing poke but I really think the bento box is the best option. You get your choice of rice, noodles, salad, green beans and a crunch ""dessert"" all in one with your choice of proteins."
9/28/2021,5,"Absolutely love, coming to Bento Asian Kitchen. The food is always fresh, and tasty. There staff is super friendly and accommodating, and did mention how quick they get you in and out the door. Loveccominf to my Bento at Pembroke Pines City Center"
11/1/2022,5,the best quick asian food i've had. better than pf chang or panda express for sure. affordable and comes in large quantities.
12/22/2020,5,"This was my first time trying this place, someone had told me that it was really good and boy was I surprised. If you like Asian food, with a lot of options then you will enjoy this place.I would suggest ordering ahead, we had gone in for take out and ordered on the spot, it took 10-15 minutes, which is understandable but next time I'll probably order online.The food is really good, came out hot and everything was accurate to what we ordered. The one guy we talked to was super nice and helpful, showed us the different options we could go with.The sushi is surprising good, sometimes you get ok sushi from places who have it on the menu just to sell sushi but this was fresh, tasty, and fairly priced.  Overall menu, is fairly priced as well. They also have bubble tea, if you're into that.Dine in is available but they have limited seating in there, maybe 1/4 of the restaurant is open for sit in dining.Overall, great place, really good food, will be stopping in again to try the other products."
8/26/2021,5,"Nice environment, menu is very straight forward food is fresh. Customer service was good can't complain. Some of their foods were big portions which is good because I didn't stay hungry very delicious food."
7/20/2022,4,"Service is great. I am leaving a review to bring awareness of how lazy and arrogant people here are. I was picking up my food and as I was leaving, I see that a younger guy parked in the handicap spot. No handicap sticker or placard. He left his car on so he was running inside to pick up food. I proceeded to point out that he was in a handicap spot. He looked at me, looked at the sign, rolled his eyes, and walked into the restaurant. He kept watching out the window to make sure I didn't take his car. This behavior is gross and just lazy. Yet it's very ""normal"" in Florida. There is no respect for the handicap in this state."
12/9/2020,3,"I was in the area and did a search for food nearby to my location and this popped up. So here I came.  I ordered from my car - the reception was not very good, I could hardly hear them and they me. They also put me on hold for three minutes? I nearly hung up.  However he came back and I placed my order.The restaurant is located right opposite a massive car park, so plenty of spaces for patrons - so fear not.It seemed busy when I went in.  I collected my order, all went well. I proceeded to eat my Crunch sushi roll in the car.  MMMMM, it was ok. But I would definitely NOT order this again - not my fever, but I was curious to try it, as it intrigued me.  I would not go out of my way to eat here again, nor would I avoid it.  However I prefer family one off businesses with individuality for the food and decor, as opposed to generic chain restaurants, and it appears that Bento is one of those."
4/22/2022,1,"DISGUSTING TREATMENT ordered on Ubereats, the restaurant didn't give the driver my drink or put in my extra sauce, had to drive over there myself, was greeted by some guy who looked like he worked back of the house, he asked how he could help me, I explained that I had to drive over here and STILL PAY for this drink that you all forgot to give the driver, and I need my side of sauce, he gets me the drink and tells me it's a $1 for the sauce, I explain that the fact I even had to drive over here to grab this stuff, I think they can waive a $1, so he shrugs says whatever and walks away from me IN THE MIDDLE OF ME SPEAKING TO HIM, I've been in the restaurant business 8 years and have NEVER ever seen such a disgusting reaction to a customer, and I've seen A LOT in the 8 years I was in the game. I should of asked his name because he needs to be fired, or not greet customers if he's gonna be a piece of trash human to them. AAnyways got my drink, got to the car, realized they made the drink WRONG, had to go back in, grab another one, come home to find he STILL DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT RIGHT and I had to sit there and pick out the boba he added that I didn't ask for.(different guy) Onto the manager who was sitting on her phone hanging out that had the audacity to tell me that it's up to the Uber drivers to get the right order.Let me educate this business and whoever from this business reads this, As the establishment that takes the payment, and makes the food, as well as packages it, it's up to YOU to make sure what's in that bag and handed to the driver is correct, that driver could get fired for even opening our food bags, nor do we want them going through it, they're job is to get the food and deliver it. I'm sure the manager didn't say a word to the disgusting man that walked away from me, but you best believe I'll be reaching out to corporate, as someone in the business for so long it takes A LOT for me to get to this point of even writing a review, worst part is I use to order from this place ALL THE TIME, now I probably will never order again."
6/28/2022,4,"I had read reviews and was hesitant about checking it out, however we decided to check it out and it was great. Food was delicious and fresh. We got surf and turf bowl and my husband got a make it yourself. We also got two boba teas. Very good food and the employee at the register was very nice and helpful."
6/2/2020,3,"Bento, you're slipping.Imagine my surprise that this location of one of my preferred chains finally opened. Sheer bliss truly! I do think, however, that they have various kinks to work out.While it seems that they're following safety protocols during the time of the pandemic, I just don't find them very organized compared to other places. It was on a whim that I decided to check them out and so I called and called. No answer except to finally get a message. It turns out you can order online on their website through DoorDash, and so, I did just that and picked up.The entire transaction was seamless. Here's my issue. When I went in to pick up, it was extremely packed, despite six feet social distancing. Not to mention that the lines converged and I was confused where to pick up despite there being a sign. I ended up getting my food relatively quickly and I was on my way.I had ordered a house salad with ginger dressing, a spicy shrimp red curry bowl, and two strawberry boba teas. While all the food was hearty and delicious, they gave me peanut dressing instead of ginger dressing and I only noticed this way later. I usually check the bag prior to leaving an establishment and I did just that, but the colors of the dressings are more-or-less the same. It wasn't until I drenched my salad in it that I realized and it annoyed me.Meanwhile, the spicy shrimp red curry was great for two meals. I ate it with glee. The strawberry boba teas were refreshing, although the color to me was a bit off. I feel it could have been redder, but then again, the base was green tea, so I really don't know. Overall, this isn't the best or the worst experience I've had with Bento, and I'll still return as it's a chain I love, and well, it's the closest to my house. I also figure that between opening shortly prior to the pandemic and the pandemic itself are reasons as to why they're not prepared to do their best (at least at this time)."
12/17/2021,1,"This place has gone so far down fucking hill it's ridiculous. I used to come here all the time when they first opened and it was mediocre but now it's on the same level as burger king. Atleast the food at burger king is hot.Came here tonight after the gym and ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and 8 pc veggie roll with 2 friends. Food came out late and cold as if it were sitting in a sub par refrigerator with lukewarm rice under it. I took one bite and instantly sent it back.2 minutes later the girl shows back up with the SAME BOWL OF FOOD. So instead of remaking it they tried to warm it up somehow which failed. It was the exact temperature as I sent it back but looked like someone stuck their hand on top and pressed it down or something. I flipped the bowl over and walked out. F*** this place, last time me or any of my friends will come here. Ever"
10/18/2021,1,"This location is continuously disappointing. Food is never close to being ready at the time promised. Last time I went, my food was given to someone else and I had to wait almost another hour for it to be recooked. Then last night I arrived 20 mins after the promised time, and they said it would be another 15 mins. I ended up asking for a refund because I'm tired of being disappointed by this place. Getting the refund was another mission and took another 15 mins because the only person that knew how to process a refund was working the food line. Then when I was leaving, all the doors were locked with this sign. Turns out they decided to close 3 hours early."
4/28/2020,5,"This place is always a hit when you want fast sit-down restaurant food.So far the best one has been the once across from the University of Central Florida. However, this location had good food too. The staff was great and the service was fast.The only downside is that you have to cross the street to park your car.  But this is not a fault of the restaurant. It is located in the far east corner of the shops  so it is easy to see. The location is huge and even though they had their dining room closed they had a lot of employees working at that time.The service.was fast."
6/3/2022,1,19$ for a bunch of white rice. I would never order again from this place. Prob the worst I have seen when it comes to poke
5/18/2020,5,"So this was weekends in the making because I kept wanting to try this place in person. That is, until the this virus took my dining out joy!I had a taste for something new and then thought about sushi.After reviewing the menu for a good hour, since I have to be very sure when ordering delivery, I finally decided to order the Miami Roll.It was a plus that they also sold Boba Milk Tea.The Miami Roll was so delicious, I almost wished I had ordered two, but the 10 pieces got me pretty full.It had steamed shrimp, krab delite**, shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy mayo...  I did like the strawberry Boba Milk Tea. It kind of had a strong green tea taste, but was good.My only issue was that it did not have any tapioca balls which was a disappointment.I look forward to trying this place again and hopefully ordering a Poke Bowl"
6/4/2022,2,"I use to LOVE this place, especially for their pad Thai. It was my favorite. I recently moved to Pembroke Pines and I use to go to the location in Orlando by UCF. Their pad Thai was amazing. So creamy, juicy, and flavorful. So I was highly disappointed when I received my order tonight.... As you can see... it's not saucy at all. I put a pic  from the website of what it usually looks like. Might go to the location one more time to try something else out and not sure if they changed the recipe but was dissatisfied."
8/25/2021,1,I have never been so disappointed in bento ever. And today the rice bowl I ordered is just unappetizing and not well prepared. I ordered an orange chicken & tofubrown rice bowl. But when I got home to get to my lunch. There's nothing but brown rice and barely any protein! I've never seen a bento meal look so disappointing. I don't think I'll be eating at bento again. Not this location.
3/9/2021,3,"First time here. Ordered the Korean Chicken Udon noodle bowl and the chicken tempura roll. I was not impressed with the roll... at all. I paid $4 for the smallest roll I have ever seen in my life. The bowl was tasty and the smell coming from the bag was tempting. I wasn't feeling the noodles, but I would definitely order the protein/ veggie mix. If I go back, I would ordered this again but ask for no noodles and replace it with stir fried veggies."
2/12/2020,5,"Luckily, I was invited to the brand new Bento Pembroke Pines location for a ""Housewarming"" prior to their official Grand Opening, and what could be better than to have the house warming on the Chinese/Lunar New Year!I've been patiently waiting for probably over a year for this location to finally open and I'm super stoked that it's finally here!  I drive past this spot nearly everyday, and it's probably going to be my new lunch spot for most of the week, LOL.I brought my wife (Tanya G.), her parents and my kids to the event.  Just like the Davie location, and I would assume the other locations, Bento has a very cool and fun design.  The interior has ample space for lots of customers to sit and a cool feel to it.Hands down my favorite Asian fast food spot.  Yes, it's fast but that doesn't mean in healthy.  Like most spots you make the line, order and wait your food to be ready.  However, they have Rice Bowls, Noodle Bowls, Sushi, Boba Tea and more.My go to meal is the the Spicy Cream (Pao Pao) Chicken on White Rice.  It's great for lunch, dinner, or even a cure for a hangover. I also get the Poke Bowl (with White Rice, Spicy Tuna, Krab Delite, Cucumber, Wakame, Edamame Peas, Avocado, Shiitake Mushrooms, Togarashi, Tempura Flakes and Spicy Kobachi Sauce)... Yeah, that's a lot... but it's Soo good!My wife and Mother-in-Law normally get the Spicy Salmon Donburi or Sushi Rolls, while my Father-in-Law gets the Sesame Stir Fry Chicken Bowl.We all love it and are excited to finally have it in the neighborhood."
2/7/2020,5,"I've waited so long for this pembroke pines location to open! Located in the new pines shopping center that has a publix and other restaurants like coopers hawk and outback. This location is right on the corner of the shopping plaza. Parking is not trouble to find as there is a big parking lot for the plaza.Inside is very similar to the other locations but just more new. Also they have added a handwashing station next to the take out items which is great. There is only 1 bathroom though but there is the handwashing station available if you just needed to wash your hands. When ordering the employees are really nice and are patient and very helpful when ordering. One of the things I noticed now is there is a picture of all the sauces on each register and what they are called.Food: literally everything is worth trying. They have raw fish to cooked chicken, beef and shrimp. My favorites are the spicy pao pao chicken and pretty much any poke bowl or sushi roll. The sushi roll was made really fresh and the fish melted in your mouth- very delicious and it wasnt hard or cold. Overall great locations and nice employees! Will come back soon!"
8/31/2021,3,"Their food is good here but it could be cooked wrong depending on who's working that day and the managers WILL argue with you even if they're wrong!!!! Because some things are clearly written in the menu... The volcano roll with salmon is supposed to have baked salmon on top according to the description and picture from the menu. When I received under cooked salmon On my roll I was told they ""usually just flame it with a torch and it's never fully cooked"". Though I've ordered from them several times this was the ONE time I had ever received under cooked salmon. The salmon wasn't going to kill me but I don't like to consume salmon that way and he should've simply apologized and accepted that a cook messed up.  Instead, he argued with me that the rolls are always prepared that and that it wasn't going to kill me. Super unprofessional. Just saying ."
2/7/2020,4,"Me and my family had the pleasure to attend Bento's Friends And Family event. We've been anxiously waiting for this location to open and we're so excited when the opportunity came up. We're pretty  accustomed  to their menu having dined at their davie location frequently. During this event they offered an exclusive 25% off our entire order. We took advantage and ordered a bunch of  different items:Drinks:1. Lychee slushie - I always love a good slushie and this hit the spot2. Iced matcha milk tea3. Iced coconut milk tea4. Pao pao chicken bowl - my husbands most favorite 5. Spicy salmon bowl with mixed veggies6. Create your own poke bowlThe service was good, you can tell they were still working out the kinks because we were checked on more frequently as normal which isn't a complaint lol. The food came out quickly and quality was just as we've experience at previous visits at other locations. Can't wait to keep coming back :)"
2/21/2021,5,I loved Bentos when I was at UF and was sad that there weren't any closer locations. I was really happy when the location on Pines opened. I placed a to go order through the app to reduce the wait time. I ordered the Pao Pao rice bowl. This establishment is great for quick and tasty Asian inspired entrees.
12/19/2020,5,"This was my first time going here and I think I  found my new go to place. Chinese type of food had always been my favorite . When you first walk in there is someone standing there to  take your orders .or it's where you pick up your food or  dine in .we always choose the take out option so we just waited a few minutes to get our food . They have all types of  drinks ,foods , sides ,sushi I love the bento box option because you get a variety  of things . The chicken was cooked to perfection. Probably could of  used a little more sauce on the chicken but it  tasted great . The salad ,cucumbers. And string beans tasted so good they also put just a little bit of dressing on the salad . The lo main was so good. And the rice I loved how it came with so much for a great price . I can't wait to try everything else ."
12/1/2020,4,"What can I say, Bento is really good. At a higher price point than Panda with more complex offerings, it is a convenient spot to order for pick-up. BTW - Their boba tea uses dairy milk and only dairy milk. I was kinda bummed. My go-to orders is a veggie stir-fry with veggies and Udon Noodles. Packed with veggies, a flavorful soy garlic sauce and the Udon Noodles are so damn good. I have tried their sushi before and the seafood is fresh and the roll is made to order."
2/5/2022,4,"Bento is always a great place to get a really quick Japanese meal, either to go or just sit outside and watch the world go by."
6/16/2021,5,"My wife and I love going all the way to this location. I LOVE the Spicy Korean Noodles and Veggie Sushi Rolls with Cream Cheese. The cream cheese hits the spot and makes it so much more flavorful. HIGHLY recommend!But I don't recommend the Miso Soup...tastes fishy, like trash"
7/18/2021,1,"The worst. This is our first time here. There's a flyer at the entrance that says ""Order Online"". So we scan that to make our orders while we find our seats. We made our order online at 8:01. We're still waiting almost an hour later. I'm literally in the restaurant making this review. My sister was in the line to order her food with my nephew and friend...and they got ALL their food before we did half an hour ago, even though our order was placed online while they were still getting in the actual line. This place has so many people working behind the counter and so many order tickets on the pass. There's no efficiency at this location for online orders. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE."
8/4/2021,3,"You're better off buying Publix Sushi than this place, the service isn't the best  I had to wait over half and hour. If you're gonna up your prices this high at least return some good service. The food was decent but not sure if I'd visit again"
1/4/2022,3,"Smells amazing,  taste average. Wouldn't go again for the price. Boba tea was good though"
12/12/2021,4,"Bento, is a good and nice place mix fast asian food, we order Pork Egg rolls, a 16oz slush, Red Coconut curry rice bowl, and a build a Poke, all the food was really good and tasty, it take just couple of minutes for the food to arrive after ordered at cashier's, the restaurant is nice and modern, clean except for no soap at woman's bathroom, my only reason for non five stars is because after we scan the Menu SQ code, they have a AD for a 15% discount if you order online! So we decide to seat and skip the line, and place our order online and take advantage of that 15% discount!, but after spending that time putting our order online, we receive a error message at check out that say the online server was down, so we have to join the line again and please our order at cashiers, we ask if they can still owner the 15% off, and the lady say no, and she mention that that online never work!. So this is my only disappointment!"
6/5/2021,1,"Waited a ridiculous time to be served!  While waiting two parties of 8 show up AFTERWARDS and get served ALL their food while my party of two wait, and wait and wait.  Finally forced to get up and ask the manager for a refund, and no good explanation other than ""sorry, don't know why it's taking so long"".  Many other options out there folks.  I will not be returning.NOTE: a server, apparently no more than 15 years old, claimed to be the manager and was totally clueless about what was happening as far as service was concerned.SUGGESTION: Put an adult with some maturity in charge so they know how to speak properly to customers!"
8/27/2020,2,"Wanted to try a new Thai restaurant and so we came to Bento. I should have known I don't like ordering my food  up front , paying, tipping before the meal. As we entered we are asked, ordering take out or eating in? We are ushered to the front where this young man said ready to order. We have never looked at this menu and I found it confusing  and not relaxing to view the menu standing and the Man at the register not really helping or explaining the menu. We ordered the volcano roll for hubby and I ordered the veggie red curry sauce meal. We are told to sit down and someone would bring the food. My meal comes out 12 minutes before hubby and its really not edible because its  so spicy my throat is on fire. Why aren't both meals brought out together so my husband doesn't  have to stare at the wall as I try to eat which is rude.I asked the manager to change my food and I asked where is the rice that goes with the meal? I didn't know I had to ask for this . He gladly changed it to yellow curry but this still was to spicy but I ate it anyway. The manager was very nice thank God he was nearby to help.Hubbies meal was skimpy and so was mine. Hubby complained his roll was to spicy .I felt for the meal this was over priced,  and looked like something out of a cafeteria in a plastic bowl with plastic silverware that we had to get ourselves . So what was the point of leaving a 5 dollar tip if waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything else? Thank goodness the manager was near by and we could ask for eel sauce and that he asked how was everything ? For improvement I would let people study the menu sitting down, add some cushions to the hard wood chairs. Also have someone that knows how to explain the menu as well as someone not only placing the food on the table and then say go get your utensils yourself, so rude. Now why the hell did I tip? There are only two other customers and plenty workers at this place so where is the service?The restaurant is pretty but that's not enough to make me want to come back.   Our lunch cost 35.00 this is not cheap for lunch"
9/12/2020,4,"I ordered the mini Mongolian steak with noodles which came out fast, was tasty and portion was big enough that I was able to take leftovers home. I tried the strawberry Ramone drink which had a light strawberry flavor and the carbonation was strong. Its small so you'll need to order 2. My son had the poke bowl with brown rice, onions,  carrots,  fried chicken and steak with teriyaki sauce.  He said it was pretty good,  a combination of his creation. We shared the tempura shrimp sushi roll. It was descent. Today's dinner was good and satisfying.  The restaurant practice social distancing, there'sasink available for hand washing, we felt comfortable dinning in.  Mask are required and no cash accepted right now only debit or credit."
4/18/2021,3,I've ordered Bento for years and not sure if their cutting costs from covid but each of the 4 sushi pieces which i paid $4 dollars for was the size of a dime. Never had a roll this small before
7/22/2021,5,Had a great experience. Food was good service was wonderful! I would definitely go back.
12/23/2021,1,Love bento but so disappointed in this location should have listened to all of the other reviews. Both meals I ordered were inedible the chicken teriyaki was so burnt it had to be thrown away and I ordered Mongolian chicken as well and got about four pieces of chicken In that bowl so I paid 16$ for fried rice. Definitely save your self the trip.
1/10/2022,4,"Came here with a friend for the first time after passing by it a couple times in the past.  Since it wasn't lunch rush, the place was pretty quiet with plenty of tables available. I ordered a noodle bowl with orange chicken and made it a combo. Food was nice and hot and the pork egg roll was nice and crunchy. Bowl was big enough for me to take home and have leftovers for the next day. Will definitely be coming back."
8/20/2020,3,"Placed an online order, food took an extra ten minutes after the pickup time before it was ready. They have dine in, but don't let you stay in to wait for your order, which is a bit unfair to me. This is the second time ordering from here where this has happened. The rolls could be constructed a little better, but they weren't bad. Will probably continue to go to the Davie location instead."
2/20/2021,1,"Dear Bento of Pembroke Pines... you've got major competition with your Davie location!! This Pines location is in dire need of major tweaking! Your employees are not on top of their game! They forgot to prepare one of our orders. They also brought out the Japanese curry that comes with the chicken katsu thick and more thick as if it was a bowl of glue. Wasn't prepared well at all! I have been to this location twice and both times, the service is super slow which is very frustrating for a place that offers a great selection of menu items and atmosphere. I am willing to drive the extra miles to get to the Davie location. That location is always on and poppin, food never late, and always hot and fresh. They are very attentive there and will ensure everything goes right. Only thing right about this place is their location. Please do better!"
3/12/2021,1,"I can not believe the service that I received today saturday the 12, 2021.Ordered about 1 hour ago and the order was not ready. (lady at the front had a horrible attitude when I asked for my food and told me to wait) Also, the food was cold, and what I got to try was bad and they got my order wrong even after I did it online. Im on hold for over 20 minutes as I type this to try talk to a manager and no one answers. the worst experience in a long time on a restaurant.take your business elsewhere! forget this place!!!!!!!"
5/29/2022,2,"This place is not worth your money. I order take out and when I got home they had forgotten to give me one of my meals so I had to go back but the food is super tiny for the price. My rolls looked so thin and small they looked weird, the side dishes $7 or $8 for a handful of green beans and I mean probably 7 green beans in the container. Total rip-off never going back"
4/3/2021,4,"So I've ordered food from Bento's probably more than a handful of times. I was first introduced by my brother when he had the Pao Pao Spicy Cream chicken. I'll tell you right now you can't go wrong with this meal. The flavors and the sauce on the protein is really good. It's literally my go to meal. I recently had an issue with my meal where I place my order online, picked it up, and got back home to find that it was the wrong order. My initial reaction was frustration because I was so hungry but I called and asked to speak to the manager. I spoke to Albert who I believe is the kitchen manager and he was super nice. I truly appreciated the great customer service. He apologized and we arranged something for the next time I come in. I understand mistakes happen and this was the first mistake that ever happened with my order after coming by more than a handful of times. I'll definitely be back because between the Pao Pao chicken and the steamed pork dumping I can't get enough. Oh also, I always get their White Sauce on the side. It pairs really well with the Pao Pao spicy cream. Once I revisit again I'll probably change my rating to 5 starts."
5/19/2020,4,"Always fresh, this location never disappoints. My go to is the Miami Roll with brown rice! There has been a wait (especially during quarantine) but that's because so many people are ordering. Also, great location right in Pines City Center"
4/2/2021,3,"I would have given this place a 4, but the overcooked chicken in my bfs noodle bowl, and the long wait for my poke bowl made me knock it down a star. The crunch roll was sooo goood! At first, they were quick with bringing stuff out, but then my poke bowl which doesn't require any cooked ingredients took the longest to come out. My bf had to go up and ask for it when other people that came after us, started getting their food. When I finally got it, it was way too spicy. It's like the sauce they marinated the salmon and tuna, they just dumped the excess into the bed of brown rice. My bfs sriracha chicken bowl was apparently too spicy and not enjoyable. He said that it tasted like the chicken was cooked in old oil. The restaurant is mismanaged and long wait time for people who go to pick up. Also, the service there is okay. We kept seeing that the guy who kept bringing food out kept messing up other tables orders. I would like to come back again and give this place another chance, so I will update this review if I see any improvements."
1/15/2022,1,Restaurant ran out of a specific sauce therefore I respectfully requested for a refund after multiple attempts to replace the meal but nothing I was interested in. But while requesting for a refund the manager Kyra had both her AirPods in while i was trying to speak to her about the refund because i noticed she only refunded 1/2 of my order (noodle bowl and ginger salad). I was trying to ask her why she couldn't just refund the whole thing but her AirPods must've been loud so that's just rude. Never going back again
1/31/2020,5,"I've been waiting for this location to open! I got to know Bento at the Davie location. This location had a ""soft opening"", so there were no major advertising about its opening because they're still training staff and getting their workers ready. The staff was super friendly! For the price, you get a good amount of food and it's very flavorful. I got the beef udon noodles, it had plenty of beef and vegetables! Will be back to try it's other dishes. This place is probably a little bit more expensive than your typical mom & pop Chinese restaurant, but Bento has a more Asian ""fusion"" flavor as its menu offers sushi, bento boxes and some Thai dishes."
2/29/2020,5,"Was so excited when I drove by Bento and saw that it finally opened in Pembroke. They're having their ""soft open"" and while I'm not sure how that differs from the actual open, I wasn't disappointed by the experience. The interior is much more relaxed and inviting than their Davie counterpart. The food is just as good and consistent. Service was pretty quick too - a to go sushi order took ~10 minutes.Definitely the Bento I know and love from Davie. The variety and quality is excellent. I ordered the Korean chicken in gochujang sauce bento box and a separate sushi combo. The combo is a great value; a California roll and two half sushi rolls for ~11.One of my favorite fast casual spots in SoFlo."
11/5/2021,1,"Took forever to give me one roll that was sitting on the counter while the employees stood there and talked. Once I had to ask for it they got it, after asking multiple times for eel sauce and asking again when he handed it to me and told me he put it in there, get home with no sauce."
2/4/2021,5,"I love my local Bento. Although the food is not super authentic, it is definitely good. My favorite thing on the menu is the krab rangoons. They're delicious. The bento boxes are filling and I love the little cinnamon dessert that comes in them as well. Def recommend"
1/26/2020,5,"I came for the friends & family event tonight. Decided to get two noodle bowls and hot lava roll. Service was quick and friendly. The location was very cute and easy to find. The food  was spot on, they did  a good job, everything was tasty and exactly what I was expecting. This is a great addition to the Shopping plaza!"
12/1/2020,5,"As a sushi lover, Bentos is such a great option for local sushi. It's usually my go to for takeout and they never seem to disappoint. All of the food is always fresh and fulfilling. I love their crunch roll and the fried rice. The service is very fast and the staff is very accommodating. I also use their app to complete my mobile orders for pick up after work."
11/29/2020,5,Really impressed with this place! We ordered take out and it was very fresh and tasty. The poke bowl was a great portion and I love that the Hawaiian included mango slices. Thai tea was actually really good and authentic tasting! Love that they have both steamed and fried pork dumplings.
9/5/2021,1,Second time I come here and second time I am dissatisfied with the service they took my order 7:38 and it's been 40 minutes and still waiting. This happened before as well the food is good but don't come here if you are really hungry. The door says there might be a delay do to short staff but there is no way a Katsu Chicken Bento box should take that long. I asked about the food and they said it was coming out soon. Sadly this will be the last time I come here!
10/19/2020,3,"Bento is very... convenient when you have that Asian craving but don't want to do the work to research a hidden gem. It is very Americanized, so do not expect authentic. The batter on anything fried is very thick here. I've been here many times with friends when we are shopping around the shops and want a quick bite. I recently have come back due to my favorite poke place being closed  (also in the towers) and I have to admit, the poke bowls do not compare :( Bento charges they same price as poke ramen right next to it but skimps on all of the toppings and the fish."
9/24/2020,5,"It's new. It's popular. Right outside of a brand new plaza in the area. It will def get the foot track it wants post-COVID. When I drive by grabbing groceries there's always a line so I decided to finally order from Postmates. The poke bowl was great, depending on the size of your appetite I would just get the biggest one. The smaller bowls are a tease unless you are pairing it with other rolls. The milk tea was a 3/5 for me. I've had from many other restaurants in the area so it's not on the level to replace my favorite at this time. Maybe post quarantine I can dine in or pick up for the full customer service experience."
6/4/2021,1,"Poor service, when coming in after ordering your food online there is a lack of someone trying to help you, they just put the food bags on a table/shelf with the receipt not facing the customer so your just left clueless on what bag is your order and the employees look like chicken with there head cut off trying to avoid all customer. Basically had to go behind the counter to see what bag was my order, (it was there) after asking two different employees about the order and them telling me let me check. Honestly this seem like a lack in management and in training!"
9/13/2021,2,Food was dry.  Rice was stale.  Appearance was horrible.  You could tell they gave everyone stale rice and old fish.  It is definitely not worth bragging about.   I thought I would have a better review.
1/29/2020,5,"This restaurant just opened and it is surprisingly performing very well for a newly opened restaurant with new employees and a broad menu. This is a very nice location with great quality food and great prices to match. I have been several times to the Bento in Davie which is why I have been anxiously awaiting for thii location  to  open. If you've been to the Davie location toon and enjoy that lovAtion you will  love this new location. Better parking, a very nice outdoor seating area, quick service.I will add thaT my only negative as this location opted to go for a standard soda machine over the Coke Freestyle I grew used to in the Davie location."
3/11/2022,1,Never have I had a California roll come to the table and smell old and gross when I opened box cucumbers were all soggy and old tried twice same thing. nothing but kids in there making sushi it tastes like crap sorry that's the honest truth! Will never waste 8.50 again on a cheap made roll with subpar ingredients gross
10/29/2020,3,"First time dining in. For the price I wasn't impressed with the value. We ordered a tofu Bento Box, Chicken Teriyaki Ramen bowl , Crab Wonton, Hot Lava Roll, and Chicken Tempura Roll, two drinks and shared with a group of four. The meals were luke warm, the wonton crisps in the bento box were soggy, the tofu was overcooked and hard and the ginger salad not fresh. Otherwise we enjoyed the teriyaki chicken ramen noodle bowl, krab wontons, and pineapple green tea. The teriyaki chicken was seasoned and cooked well and the noodles were fresh. We spent over $50. Would not return for a family meal but would visit again for lunch for one person only. I would have spent around the same amount at my favorite local sushi bar."
7/9/2021,1,"0 stars if I could honestly...the first time I came here I waited almost 40 minutes for my takeout order. Which is fine, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe the food will be worth it I thought to myself. I asked for an update on my order and the manager responded with a rude undertone stating ""it's coming"". Fast forward a couple months later, I decide to give them another shot.... this time I decided I'll order online and pickup, that way I won't have to worry about long wait times or rude customer service..... I place my order, it says it will be ready in 40 minutes...LOL... okay I'll wait, I show up at the restaurant 45 minutes later and they're telling me oh we haven't even started your order. Moral of the story, don't come here if you want your food on time."
7/21/2020,4,"Ate at bentos over quarantine, so sadly I can't rate their customer service or cleanliness. However, their food satisfied my long taste for home back in Hawaii. I had a poke bowl, a special roll, regular sushi, and a local favorite. I love sushi so this will definitely be my new sushi place. I also had miso soup & milk tea. Although I forgot to order tapioca w my tea, it didn't taste quite the same like how we make it in Hawaii, nevertheless, I finished it so it wasn't terrible. Arigato Gozaimasu, bento  I will be returning soon"
8/10/2021,1,I ordered two fried rice togo and I received one. Then it took them almost a hour to give me the second order. I was returning here after not eating here for a while I guess I was right to not come back!
10/10/2020,4,"It's a strong choice if you're hungry and want something fast but not fast food. Customizable menu with options for a hearty meal. Flavors were on point but it did strike me as a little less healthy and a little more indulgent. Hubs said, ""It'll hold down a grown mans hunger"""
8/27/2021,1,"My first time going to bento and I can promise you never again, it took over 45 mins to get my order, people after me got their meals before me, it was poorly packaged and all the food was flavorless and dry. $30 for 2 small plates and it was terrible."
2/1/2022,5,After a negative experience I spoke with the Manager Bianca and she made the situation right! Thank you and I hope to continue to enjoy the food and ambiance here!
7/13/2020,2,"I've ordered from here a bunch of times. The last 3-4x no chop sticks!! I've had to eat my sushi with a fork, which is very odd. Spending over $50 in food & no utensils."
12/2/2021,2,"I used to love Bento but my last experience was pretty terrible. They've changed/eliminated some of the original bowls that were so good and upped the prices. The management was so chaotic I had to request a refund for my boba tea after waiting over an hour only to find out they had run out of boba. The food was disappointing and overpriced and the management seemed understaffed, probably won't be returning."
8/31/2020,5,I have been going to Bento since they opened their very first location. I recently moved to South Florida and decided to place an online order at the Pembroke Pines location. I ordered my go-to which is the sushi combo box. My food was ready for pickup at the promised time and everything was fresh.
6/13/2021,5,Amazing food a little pricey for a fast food but the taste is amazing  we try the Mongolian noodles and Pad Thai and also a spicy tuna Roll everything was good
12/5/2021,1,"If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would. The only reason I've gone to this restaurant 3 times is because the food is actually very fresh and the food tastes amazing. But, however good the kitchen staff is, is overshadowed by the atrocious customer service given by the owners and front store employees. I say this because every single time I've gone, I've waited over an hour for my food. The first time, not only did they also get my order wrong, but they gave it to the wrong person so they had to remake my food. I let this slide and didn't complain because there's a sign on the front door that said they were super short staffed. As there's currently a pandemic, it's understandable that the food would take a long time. The second time I tried the restaurant, although there wasn't a mix up with the food I still waited a long time. I decided to try the restaurant one more time, and this time order on the app as I knew there would be a long wait. I get a notification from Uber saying that my food is ready. I go pick it up, and they do not have it made. And apparently, the app WAS able to send the ticket to the register but not the kitchen. I was then told by the teenage cashier to not order from Uber eats pickup anymore because it was inconvenient to the restaurant. I asked her to speak to the manager as I still wanted my food, and I wanted it rushed because I had waited long enough. Had I not paid for it through the app anymore, I would have left. After going back and forth with her a few times, she finally called her manager which didn't want to talk to customers, (I heard him tell the employee when he thought i wasn't looking) and he comped my whole meal and said that I'd need to contact Uber to get the refund through the app as he's not able to administer it on his end. If they're as short staffed as the restaurant seems to be, I can't blame the poor young manager for not wanting to talk to ""disgruntled"" customers. But unfortunately, that's his main job as a manager. When I arrived he was helping out the cooks in the kitchen. As a manager, he should drop helping the kitchen staff and deal with the customer. There were so many issues with my interactions at this restaurant. And this is so sad of an issue for me because it's SUPER close to my house and I'm obsessed with sushi and rice bowls. Although I finally ended the last experience on a good note, (the manager took care of my meal) the fact that so many small hiccups happened made them lose what could have been a loyal customer. The company should make sure, BEFORE they partner with any third party app (such as Uber or other delivery/pickup company) that everything works smoothly. The cashiers are the first point of contact for a customer, so they need to make sure that when an order is received (whether it's in person or not) that they confirm it with the kitchen. And the manager needs to actually WANT to speak to customers, and actually communicate any tech problems with the owners/ company so that it doesn't happen in the future."
5/11/2021,1,"Horrible service. I told the employee at the front my name because i ordered online. After 45 minutes of not receiving my food I approached and asked what the hold up was. She then said, ""oh we don't have salmon we can't make your roll."" This is no issue to me, but the fact that my food has just been waiting there and she couldn't have the decency to let me know earlier is frustrating. I waited one hour total for a poke bowl and a roll. Her excuse was that she had no way of contacting me when I was standing in front of her for one hour. She really needs to reconsider her job choices maybe go work at a park somewhere because she is absolutely useless. (this was on may 11, 2021 at 1pm so you could really teach her some customer service bento, come on."
4/16/2020,5,"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in town. I'm glad this business is still operating with everything going on due to covid-19. I usually build a Poke Bowl. The regular size bowl is really filling for one person. If you order a large, I'd say it's shareable for 2. Great quality, fresh food, and friendly staff. If you call ahead to place an order, you'll get 15% off too."
6/5/2020,2,"Very disappointed !!! This was my first time coming to this location, normally I go to the one by Nova University.The wait was horrendous ... not sure why because had plenty of staff working and prepping and the was not much people ordering.Ordered three bowl - - one red curry tofu bowl -rice hard and a very small portion, the tofu was dry and guess they forgot the curry sauce because had none...- one shrimp general Tao with brown rice - same thing the rice was stale, shrimps dry... no sauce - chicken general Tao- same thing!!!!!Horrible!!!!Hope you get your act together .... do not recommend this one location..."
6/25/2020,5,"I love love love Bento since first eating it during my college years in Gainesville Fl. This was the place where I first learned about and began eating sushi. My favorite at the time was the Crunch roll. Tasting this one years later was not my favorite due to their breading but all of their other sushi soooo good! Mt Fuji, Hot Lava, Caliente, Mex and Special Mex, and Fried Avocado are my go to's. I also was a fan of their General Tso's chicken but their Spicy Pao Pao Chicken although a little too sweet is my new favorite! Bento never disappoints and their food is prepared fresh and in a Flash!"
6/20/2021,2,This restaurant does not accept cash?! I wanted to try this place but it is card only. Seems sketchy.
5/13/2021,1,"Funny how they have someone responding to the negative reviews asking me to send an email, yet I did and received zero response. Not surprised!"
12/5/2020,2,My first time at the Pembroke pines location my first impression is the restaurant is clean and orderly also very empty compared to the David store anyway I ordered the Mongolian beef with extra beef and vegetables for lunch ( I ordered online for pick up) I got there and my food was ready for pickup anyway after tasting my food I could understand why the store has way fewer customers than the Davie location the rice was undercooked and rest of the meal was kinda bland but still edible i was hungry so I eat everything long story short the food gave me an upset stomach for 3 hours the lesson i learned is the bento on university Dr. Is worth the extra driving and wait ...
3/29/2021,1,"Normally this place is wonderful...today they should be ashamed of themselves. Their employees have zero hospitality skills. Our food took 25 minutes. Our cold edamame sat at the window while the ""shift manager"" sent our order back as it was wrong. She proceeded to argue with me about how long the food was taking and more so, purposely let our appetizer sit and get cold. The food was not good but after waiting so long we rushed to eat to get back to work. Restaurants have a choice how to treat customers and by the overall attitude of her and her staff she needs to be fired or retrained. There will be no next time. Stay away from this place."
12/4/2021,2,"I placed an order through the phone and I ordered a mt. Fuji roll and a chicken tempura roll with ADDED crab delight. When I got home I realized they had taken the chicken out of the roll. I called to explain the situation and they offered to fix it or replace it, I decided since I wasn't to far I'd just switch it out. When I got to the store, after explaining that I had called about my order the girl at the front took the roll I had brought in to exchange and went to the manager Linai* telling her what had happened, I heard her complaining say I had ordered it like that and that it's my fault it's wrong and afterwards her and the front staff gave me dirty looks. The guy who answered the phone twice I believe his name was javon was very nice and helpful. The food was good overall I just wish management wasn't so nasty."
2/5/2020,4,"Soft opening... the service was absolutely terrific. I hope it stays that way. The food was hot, quick and tasty - but in no way authentic to any Asian culture, lol. So let us call it Asian Fusion. We had a variety - volcano roll, crunch roll, lava roll, Szechuan sauced tofu over brown rice, Pad Thai, Korean sauced tofu over udon noodles, Korean sauced chicken over lo mein noodles, a tofu poké salad bowl, and miso soups. The Pad Thai lacked fish sauce, had no egg, bean sprouts or appropriate noodles! The sauce was also waay too sweet. Lol! Is that even Pad Thai anymore!?!? The exterior of the crunch roll was like gordon's fish sticks when I was a kid - no bueno. My 3 yr old is the miso soup connoisseur... she has it as a starter just about everywhere.. she picked out the tofu and left the broth. (Her go to is Emerald Thai where she cleans the bowl) The sauce varieties are all generic, salty and sweet. (Catered to the American palette?) You order at the counter and get a table number. Food starts coming out to tables in about 5 minutes. What the restaurant loses in terms of authenticity, it wins with service, speed, fresh/crunchy veggies, variety, and generous serving sizes. If you are looking for tasty Asian fast casual, every dish is made to order with your choice of base, protein, sauce and available substitutions. The level of variety makes it highly suited to groups. Meat eaters and vegans will all leave with happy full bellies!"
1/25/2020,5,"Came by for their family and friends event and even thought the staff is still training they were amazing can't wait for them to open officially the fooD is flavored deliciously and taste very fresh.  They offer a large variety off options from poke bowls, rice bowls, various types of noodle bowls. They also offer sushi and a variety of it."
3/2/2020,5,"I'm glad there's a location in Pembroke Pines area. I normally order the saracha garlic shrimp with rice and the poke bowl. Bento is the place to be, there is so much variety to choose from. There's so much parking spaces and friendly staff :)"
1/25/2020,4,Edit: Unfortunately I have to edit my review.This is my second time coming to the new Bento and the problem has been the same both times the sauce in their bowls is basically non existent....The one thing I love about Bento and what I also compliment is how crispy the tofu is and how much sauce is in their bowl (I usually go to the Davie location) They put enough sauce to cover the tofu and the noodles to the point where there's always leftover sauce on the bottom of the bowl. It makes it tasty and makes the meal come together.At the new Bento on Pembroke they only cover the tofu with sauce and then your noodles are left uncovered with the hopes of a miracle..I'm not sure what the difference is if it's instructions for them not to put a lot of sauce or because it's a new establishment the cooks are still getting used to it idk... I couldn't tell you. But from my experience I can't waste money anymore and I go to Bento once a week so I'm going to keep going to the Davie location. I hate being a bother and having to ask for extra stuff when most places I do. I just want one place that I don't have to instruct to make a perfect meal.So if you go to the Davie location and you're looking into this one cause it's closer I truly just suggest you go to the Davie one.Sorry PP Bento gotta keep going to the My OG They make everything at perfection and I'm sure it's just years of getting it right.Thanks for opening and wish you all the best of luck. I also Included a picture of my bowl so y'all could see what I'm saying. BENTO asian kitchen + sushi'sNew Location on Palm and Pines (I eat at the Davie one every week but this one is closer to me yay!)I had a great experience everyone was on point and super pleasant.The customer service was amazing & the location is clean and beautiful..Can't wait to come again   thank you for the invite to your family and friend rsvp housewarming The sauce in my bowl was a little too watery (I know because I eat it so often lol) and when I asked for extra sauce they insisted to remake my bowl.Everyone went above and beyond to make it feel super welcome.Sorry Davie but I got a new place in town P.s. I always order the sriracha and garlic bowl with ramen noodles and edamame (vegan friendly)If anyone suggests anything different feel free to comment.
2/15/2020,3,"The place just opened it seems and it's got great options just like the other ones.I decided to try out the szechuan noodles and it was really salty, and not spicy at all.It had some red peppers on it, but not a while lot.My mom had the chicken garlic broccoli store fry and she said it was good and not too salty.The kids meals, was actually really neat. As it came with chicken teriyaki, rice, green beans, and even some of these cinnamon dessert thing.My sister had a bento box, which is always the best deal.The bento box comes with the california roll and you pick the other 4 pc.Over all the place has potential, but it is still new.The soups were salty. The one from the combo of the bento box and the one from the noodles.I would come back, and with hope they don't put the whole salt shaker in the soups anymore."
2/9/2020,4,"You can tell this place is new because of the newly built plaza and modern dining setting inside. Very well made lay out of the restaurant. Ordering at the front was easy and quick. They bring out your food to your table, but I do think that process needs to be better organized as we had a server approach our table with the wrong food and when another server came to give us our food order they seemed unsure if it was our food until they asked us and we confirmed. But overall food quality was great! The sushi quality for Bentos is by far the best I've tasted so far compared to other locations. My sushi loving self will be back!!"
3/8/2021,5,"I have never been to this place in person, but I order from Postmates often, so I can only talk about the food. The food always tastes fresh and it's delicious. The prices are reasonable. I've never had a bad experience with food and always come back for more."
11/8/2021,1,"I placed an order using their mobile app on October 25 and never received my food. It has now been two weeks and I have not received my refund from the restaurant. DoorDash says the restaurant is responsible for paying me back. I have been overdrawn and cannot buy groceries because I have not been paid back my money. I went to the restaurant in person and was told to send an email because they could not help me. I am still not sure if I will ever get my money back. I feel this is a horrible way to treat customers, especially when it is such a large amount of money. I wish there was a way to give zero stars."
2/4/2020,5,"Just like everyone else on here - I am so excited we have a Bento further south from the Davie location! Seems this location is still in it's soft opening phase which is great and not as chaotic and packed like the Davie one. Smells like new furniture once you walk in! This location is by far spacious, clean, and has a hand washing sink near the fountain drink machine which is great for me and everyone else who likes to eat with clean hands. Haha! I always mix up my order when I come. I don't really have a particular favorite, but this time I ordered the sriracha garlic shrimp bowl with ramen noodles. It was great with it's spicy kick. I also ordered the Hot Lava roll and a cup of miso soup. So tasty! My younger sister ordered a Pao Pao Chicken Benton Box and a fruit slush. Her only complaint was that the slush was a tad too sweet but they had no problem remaking it for her. Yay for Bento and this new location!"
11/6/2021,2,Not very clean usually and I got a orange chicken bowl and they didn't give me the green beans I ask form them after and they never brought them they are my favorite I usually even buy extra. :/
3/9/2021,3,"The two guys taking my order were really nice!!!! They have lots of options in their menu. I came for their sushi. Now, the two stars I removed is because it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to finally get 8 pc of sushi!!! Everyone came and left me there. I'm guessing it's better to Uber eat or pay before you go there. Anyhoo, I had the panko fried Avo and my sister had Japanese bagel. Both was delicious. I would definitely order here again."
1/29/2020,5,"I was recently invited to check out this new location and I have to say it was up to par! The staff was very kind and understanding of my guests diet restrictions. I tried a regular poke bowls with steak, steamed shrimp and added the new sesame string beans (amazing)! I also had two mini poke bowls with spicy tuna, just different toppings. The tuna was fresh and cut perfectly. I also tried the coconut yellow curry with chicken. The vegetables were cooked just enough that they were still firm and the curry was flavorful! The management team did a great job training everyone! Thank you to Bento!"
2/10/2021,3,"I have eaten from here 5 times now, two delivery orders and three dining room orders, two out of the three restaurant visits were on the weekend.The food is so good when it comes out as you have ordered it and in a timely fashion. Both delivery orders and one dining experience was perfect the other two dining experiences were awful.Cashier doesn't even greet me and once I start my order another employee comes over and the two of them start talking. He leaves I finish up and again not a thank you or your order will be right out or anything.Two out of three dishes come out without even a word as to the third and no side of sauce. 10 minutes pass my daughter finishes her meal I get up to ask about the third dish and am told it's coming also ask for a side of sauce (which I ordered). Manager comes over and says everything will be right out. Wait another five minutes still nothing. Finally my husband gets his lunch but still no sauce, I ask again. How difficult is it to bring a side of sauce?Arrive right at opening no one eating in. Place my order.Food arrives incomplete. Bowl arrives no green beans, no sushi order. Girl says they don't come with my bowl, menu states differently. She says it's in the bowl I show her there are no green beans so I sit down she asks the kitchen. Out comes a side of green beans ok no problem. I ask about my four pieces of sushi she says they are coming. Now the place is filling with to go orders, people are coming in and out and all the staff are working on filling the orders including the one girl who was helping me. four orders, five orders filled and picked up, no sushi. I finish my bowl and I'm about to get up and ask for a refund and then finally receive the rest of my lunch. Look down no wasabi! I get some ones attention and ask for a little wasabi and again I'm waiting and waiting....Order delivery you will have better luck. Don't expect fast service here. Keep your mask on because you are going to need it every time you have to get up and ask for something you ordered!"
3/11/2021,1,Very dissatisfied with the treatment that we received today. A pharmaceutical rep ordered lunch for our entire office and one of the orders which happened to be for the doctor did not arrive. We understand that mistakes like this happen but when we called to let them know the lady who bagged the food told us it was impossible because she bagged it herself. She did not want to help us in any way and we had to deal with the backlash from the doctor here at the office. The lady acted like we were lying and we were just trying to get some free food or something. We only claimed one order was missing when we had more then 15 orders. Super disappointed. Terrible customer service
2/4/2021,1,"Ordered thru uber eats, they dont give option for sauces and now I call and get an employee by name Rene who says to me that if I want a sauce to go with my bowl that I need to order again and pay 50cents, seriously!? Uber does not offer an option to add sauce, they just lost a good customer"
2/13/2020,5,"This location was having a soft opening so I decided to drop in for a bite to eat. There was a little line to place the order however the line went quickly and allowed me time to go through the menu and decide what to eat. I decided to go with the build your own. I chose a regular in which you can select two proteins, 2 base- sushi rice, salad, brown rice, poke noodle, 5 add ins like fruit, cheese and avocado, 2 toppings like fried garlic, fried onion, tempura flakes, scallion, pickled ginger and 1 choice of sauce. For my  Poke bowl I chose 1/2 brown Rice 1/2 salad, mango, pineapple, cucumbers, avocado, scallions, crispy wonton topping, tempura flakes, tempura shrimp and fried salmon. My bowl was delicious. I enjoyed all the different textures in the food. I never had salmon fried which was a treat. It kind of makes it a little dry but with the sauces and fruits in the bowl, it adds a crunch. I was so pleased with this place. Everything was fresh and made well. I will definitely be visiting frequently."
2/1/2020,5,Love! Love! Love! I first had Bento Cafe when I was in college in Gainesville but when I moved back home I  couldn't find much to beat my sushi craving. Then when I saw they opened close to home I was soooo excited! I even brought my hometown friends to try Bento and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something fun and good! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)
2/25/2020,5,"Great quick service spot! Food is affordable and great quality! For cooked food I recommend the pao pao chicken over udon noodles and for sushi I recommend the volcano roll. For appetizer the steamed dumplings are a very generous size, the garlic edamame is amazing, and the crab wontons are great!For soup, my favorite is the szechuan beef noodle soup! A little spicy but I prefer it over pho anyday. I'm not a big pho fan so if I'll take this to cure my hangover."
9/24/2021,1,"I so rarely leave reviews but this was such a disappointment. There was a sign on the door asking us to bare with them for being short staffed. That's fine. I can wait a little longer. What's not fine is waiting 45 minutes for cold rice and noodles and hot salad. The orange chicken was good. The ""Teriyaki"" udon noodle bowl was plain udon noodles with plain grilled chicken on top with some beans. After waiting 10 mins for the sauce it was better. The Hot Lava roll was the nastiest roll i ever had. I've never left so much food on the table after eating. We never got our boba tea because we had to leave. The one star goes to the staff because they were nice I hope they're treated well."
2/23/2020,5,This location just opened. I am used to going to the Plantation location. The food is so fresh and evenly seasoned. By far my favorite restaurant and I have waited patiently for this location to open. I was not disappointed. Manager is so helpful and kind. Staff is friendly and this bright airy location is ideal. Food is to die for. Everything is new and clean. I can't say enough about the food. So enjoyable! Mango Boba tea with mango boba is my very favorite! So much food I will have to take some home.
1/30/2021,2,"Online Order Pick Up-Horrible!This review is only for online pick up experience. Always the worst with this location. Of the 4 times that I have done online ordering, only once have they ever had my order ready in time. Today was the final straw, they gave away my order when I came to pick it up. I was told they would work on it right away. 40 minutes later I was given my order. I saw 6 pick up orders prepared while I waited and  customers come in and order, and they got their food before I got my order. Never was offered an apology or some kind of compensation until I said something about having to wait 40 minutes. That is not a good customer service experience."
3/19/2021,1,"This is THE WORST SERVICE i ever EVER experienced. I placed my order at 8:00 pm to be ready by 8:30. I got here at 8:45 to pick up and i am still currently waiting at 9:07 pm. I asked the cashier when my food would be ready and she said ""5 minutes, They're just cutting up your sushi roll."" Come to find out, 20 minutes later, that they hadn't even made my roll yet. This is probably the most ridiculous time i have ever waited for food. I've gotten in lines at Disney World faster then this... needless to say i WILL NOT be returning to this bento. I like the one in Davie 100000000x better. Also, this staff has A LOT to be desired. I was treated so poorly yesterday it was actually disgusting. The staff was rude and incompetent."
3/16/2021,3,This bento is makes no sense. They gave me the wrong order twice. You have to pay extra for sauce when you order online. The wait is horrible no matter how small your order and how empty the place is. They need help...
12/23/2020,1,"Absolutely dreadful experience at bento in November.  Quality was subpar, definitely don't consider dining in anymore, this place primarily caters to takeout diners now.  Fruit flys everywhere inside, staff sitting around at all the tables, everything is served in plastic soup containers.  Steak Mongolian entree was inedible, practically a soupy stirfry beef dish.  I was expecting something. Resembling pei weis version of Mongolian and didn't come close to anything in the description.  Pei wei is by far superior to bento these days.  Unfortunately pandemic has changed the quality of this venue big time :("
3/10/2021,1,"This is more a review of Bento's service. The food is fine.I have been ordering from this specific restaurant at least 10 times, mostly to deliver. They seem to be using DoorDash to do their deliveries.With my last order, the order was shown as delivered, but no one actually showed up. I tried calling repeatedly for over 30 minutes and no one would pick up the phone for me to let them know of the issue.I eventually had to drive all the way over there to talk to someone in person and was told that they actually disconnect the phones after a certain hour intentionally. It's plain dumb, but it was not the issue.After having talked to someone there, they agreed to prepare the lost order with an expedited service, which they did. But they still needed to credit the delivery fee. The agreed to, but I insisted that they also credit the tip that was given to the DoorDash driver. After much convincing and involvement of the manager, they agreed to credit the tip as well. This was not the issue, EITHER. I would have gathered that DoorDash would credit the entire amount to them for the error.I have waited over a month before posting this review to give them time to process the refund. Not only I was not credited for the tip; they did not even credit the delivery."
2/20/2020,5,"Best place ever!!! I love that I can customize my poke bowl or choose to have a noodle bowl. There's a variety of options to choose from. For me, one of the best fast food places to eat. It's clean and the employees are attentive and nice. The cherry on top is the kitchen is open, so you get to see how the chef cooks your food. 5 stars all the way. Oh, and the bubba tea and crab wonton is soooo good"
2/15/2020,2,The line was horrendous had to wait 35 minutes for our food i order a bowl and you have to pay five dollars for the brown rice and also you have to pay a dollar for the sauce that's ridiculous and it's no different than Peiwei next time I'll be going to Peiwei for sure way overpriced lots of employees and the service is horrible don't understand.
3/1/2020,5,MY FAVORITE SPOT FOR POKEBOWLS! I would have to take a 30 minute drive just to get to this spot but it was completely worth it! Love this spot the food is great.
2/15/2020,3,"Sushi Bento Box is really good but Miso soup which is complementary is too salty I was not able to eat it, don't waste you money buying this additional. Kids menu Chicken teriyaki is good, there are options of chicken or steak, One of our party ordered a noodle soup and stated that it was super salty as well. I understand that the place is soft opened but I would advise to train better the staff. Cashier was not able to split the check on two credit cards and when you go to ask something from the staff no one notice you, but you need to call them even though you have bee waiting for a while and they see you waiting for their attention."
7/13/2021,1,"The hospitality service is very minimal here along with the ridiculous amount of time you have to wait for food there is no way this place will make it for the long haul. The place was pretty empty for the long wait that we had for food. Sushi comes out pretty quickly but For hot food, it takes very long. The staff seems lost and miserable. The sushi rolls were okay but I can't believe they charged for eel sauce in a sushi place. I don't plan to come back to this Bento which is a shame as it's so close to me."
9/27/2020,3,We have ordered take-out a bunch of times. The family really likes it but I was  it so impressed with my box. It was over sauced and bit salty. I will definitely go back but next time sauce on the side.
9/1/2020,5,Ordered from here yesterday and it is the best sushi I have had in a very long time. I had the red dragon roll and spicy tuna roll and they were so good and so fresh. My husband had a pao pao chicken bowl and it was also delicious. I am so excited I have found such a great sushi place in my area. I will definitely try again.
8/28/2020,1,"Horrible service.if I could give zero stars I would.They are beyond slow I even  ordered  online to avoid waiting and ended up waiting over 45 minutes for my order.After waiting they said that I didn't order from them .... after showing them my email confirmation they said they would start the order this is ridiculous customer service.i would never again order from them.They need to get better organized especially when it comes to online orders they are beyond overwhelmed maybe having separate people do app delivery orders,online orders and walk in would help.However I will mention they had more than enough staff even having staff just standing behind the counter looking like lost sheep.Eventually after waiting another 15 minutes I told the girl behind the counter At this point I don't even want the food because I was so frustrated to which she said she couldn't do.I told her I would be calling corporate and writing a review on this experience.After that she got the manager who was nice and did give me a refund.I am very upset because their food and teas are good but not worth the time or experience.Hopefully they can correct this and be better in the future however I will not be returning any time soon"
2/20/2020,2,"Prices are Crazy high for crazy SMALL PORTION. I order a combo box and was given the wrong sushi, what waist of money. This location is too new that the cooks DO NOT KNOW THE MENU. If you want sushi avoid this place and go to a real sushi restaurant where the chefs know different sushi types. The sushi I was given had unidentifiable food ingredients and I ordered the special Mexican sushi. I was given no napkins or utensils in my to go bag. The cashiers were nice and that's the only reason why they get 2 stars or else it would be a zero."
2/19/2020,5,"I really enjoy the food here. I want to transition my diet to become fully vegan. I really like that they offer Tofu in all of their meals. The place is very clean, the food taste awesome. I really like the spicy Kobachi sauce."
1/30/2020,5,"For an evening quick fix, this is the spot! Bentos ambience ALONE is inviting to any ""good food window shopper""! However the food and prices are what will really win you in. We came around 8:10pm, ordered the following: 1. Fried tofu udon noodle bowl with pao pao sauce. 2. Fried chicken lo mein noodle bowl again with the pao pao sauce.3. Chicken tempura roll (4 pc/$3.50) Our food came hot, FAST, and fresh! The total? $25.15. We have enough for lunch the next day. For it being a soft opening, this location functions as if it has been running for a lot longer."
9/9/2020,5,It's was amazing!!! Super delicious and well presented!!!! I found them while looking for bubble tea and the name of the sushi caught my attention!!! Very affordable fast and super yummy!!! My bf and son loves it and can't wait to get more!
4/8/2020,5,"I ordered a selection of bubble teas.  I lived in China for five months, and the four herbal bubble teas (mango, lotus, green, pineapple) I ordered at Bento were comparable to those I enjoyed in Shanghai.  Packaging  of the drinks was spill-proof!"
10/17/2020,1,"I used to be a regular customer until they  went full on Gllobalist and don't allow payment by cash. So I'm glad to give their neigjbor ""Go Pho"" my business and the food is overall is way better too"
12/13/2020,5,"One of my favorite places! Any time I want sushi they are my go-to for affordable sushi with Grade A quality and presentation. For a birthday we even used them for catering and we were not dissapointed. Their selection from poke bowls, ramen, noodle bowls, rice bowls, sushi and bento boxes is vast so you can definitely  find something you like! Highly recommend getting the bento boxes it's like a sampler."
6/13/2021,1,Absolutely the worst customer service. Ordered take out on an early Sunday afternoon when the restaurant was empty. The restaurant took 45 min to prepare my food. The food is overpriced and nothing crazy. You're better off going somewhere else.
2/28/2020,4,Service was ok.Came in and had a chicken bowl.Lil bit salty.I would definitely be back to try something else.Place is very clean and nice inside.This is gonna be a good place for many many years for people to enjoy.Look forward into trying other things on menu.
6/19/2021,1,All I have to say is lower your prices you are a fast food restaurant not no high end place.
10/24/2020,1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. Management is absolutely terrible. Go to the Davie location.
8/19/2020,1,Found this in my bowl. Reached out to the store and no one even bother to respond me. Zero customer service.
9/12/2020,5,"First time eating here, ordered through their website for my food and got it delivered via DoorDash. Delivery came 6 minutes before which was great. I ordered 2 Chicken Teriyaki Bento Boxes with Brown rice. And 2 orders of Crab  Rangoons. Food came exactly as ordered. I had to heat up again but it was tasty. Will most probably order in person.  Good place for fast Asian food. Want to try something different next time."
3/7/2020,5,"Our food was great. The service was great. The place is nice and very clean. We had 2 bowls with fried rice (up charge) and with steak, Mongolian style. Delish! Can't wait to go back for a bento box. This was a soft opening but it looks like they are headed the right way because everything was on point. Rice bowls, noodle bowls, bento boxes, sushi rolls, etc. The menu has lots to offer. This hidden gem recently opened and it's busy like they have been here forever. They definitely are doing something right and have the clients coming in like crazy. The place was packed but running smooth. The food came out very quick. Cooked perfectly. The manager was very nice and came to talk to me about my shrimp allergy and what had what and how it was cooked. Caring! 5 stars so far."
3/27/2021,5,The manager Albert made sure we were taken care of with any and everything we needed.
2/1/2020,5,"Boba and udon quick service yasssssssss!!!!!!!! Good quality for Asian fast food, alot of variety and delicious boba with a good selection of add on jelly's. Thai Thea with lychee jelly to die for....yummmm. Great vegetarian options, You can basically make anything vegetarian just ask. Nice plaza, still in development, can walk around after, and ample parking."

2/7/2020,1,"Extremely small portion sizes for higher than average prices.  The drinks are made with flavoring powder or flavoring syrup, which is completely unacceptable with some 10+ different boba places within a 15 minute drive.  The drink prices are way too high and they don't even include boba!  You have to pay extra to get boba/tapioca... even the first scoop!  Hell no.And the worst sin of them all?  PAPER STRAWS.  No.  I won't be chugging my bubble tea because the alternative is my straw disintegrates inside of the drink.  I just won't go to your restaurant."
2/10/2020,5,In love with this new location. Excellent service and all the staff was super friendly! The food was very fresh an delicious. I'm very happy that we have a Bento closer to Miami!
2/1/2020,5,Absolutely great food here! Bento box and the rice bowls are awesome. Hopefully they're going to add more to the Suushi lineup like Nigiri. I totally recommend this place.
2/1/2020,5,"We went to the soft opening, and we were  pleasantly surprised. More items on the menu than I expected. The fish tasted  fresh, the portions were good. And the service was very attentive.  We finally found a local sushi place that we love!"
4/15/2020,5,Great staff great food great service. Even with the world on fire due to this outbreak. Bento still came through. If you order please be Patient it's a wait they work as fast as they can besides the wait  it's great. Support your local restaurants and be safe out there.
4/14/2020,2,"I ordered veggie spring rolls, and pao pao (spicy cream chicken) from them through door dash. I was excited about getting this I am 7 months pregnant, so I was ready for my craving. When the food arrived it was in perfect condition as far as being from doordash, it was still warm, and all; it clearly hadn't been tampered with, so I was pleased. Now the quality of the food was pretty bad, both the spring rolls and the chicken tasted like it had been left in oil, but it wasn't crispy it was soggy, and just tasted like oil."
8/7/2021,1,"So hubby and I were undecided where to eat and he been wanting to come back to Bento  since our first experience was great the food was delicious and fresh. We decided to come in today and we placed our order and the young lady super nice great customer service took our order and reviewed our order before sending order to chef to cook our meals. We ordered lychee slush with passion fruit pops so some young man come to our table and tell me oh sorry we don't have passion fruit pops. So I'm like ok what y'all have he said ONLY MANGO. So I'm like ok that ok. Hubby orders his Florida roll sushi and they bring it to the table and the waiter comes and bring it to the table and leave and I'm asking my hubby honey where is your soy sauce for your sushi he's like let me go get it in the station. Hubby did not fine no soy. My son orders siracha something the young lady is like sorry no siracha. My son is like dam really no siracha . My son is like ok no siracha dam YALL can go to Walmart and buy it and satisfy your customers just don't say we don't have find a solution to the problem. Mind you my son is 15. I tell the waiter hey can we have soy Sauce he's like ummm sorry we don't have none. So the second item that I ask for and they done have.  ok and this place been open less than 4 months? He's reply was sorry ma'am but our supplier has not come in to bring in our shipment. I'm like ok I pay 80 bucks for 3 meals and ya don't have crap. So i asked him is there a manager in store now, he was yes we actually have 2 today would you like to speak to one of them? I'm like sure guess what IM STILL WAITING.  they are joke. 3-4 months open they are better of closing it down. This was the Third time trying them anf my last. Like if y'all have no soy sauce or siracha or any type of condiments FIND A SOLUTION JUST DONT SAY WE DONT HAVE IT OR WAIT FOR THE VENDOR TO SUPPLY YOU WITH YOUR ITEMS NO IN INVENTORY. Too bad that such a great place has gone down to crap. I would not recommend it. Not even to the animals."
3/13/2020,4,"Love the Bento Box, especially the noodles. I've had majority takeout ( like 10  times since it opened), and ate in once, and the customer service was excellent! Fair price , good food!"
3/2/2020,2,Came here 3 weeks ago during their soft opening. Ordered a chicken katsu bento box. Encountered some very chewy chicken. Kindly told the manager because feedback is important especially when you are first opening. He said he would address it with their QA manager. Waited 3 weeks and decided to give it a try again. Still soft opening so I was a tad hesitant and decided to get chicken teriyaki instead of katsu. The teriyaki sauce didn't taste like teriyaki sauce at all. That's not what bothered me though. It was the countless pieces of fatty chicken and to top it off I had a piece that was hard. Which I spit out right away because it shouldn't have been there at all. I won't be coming back to this location anytime soon.
3/1/2020,2,"As a regular customer for the Davie location, I must say the pines location has really let me down. Their food is good yet their customer service experience is bad. They regularly miss items from your order. They don't provide the proper quantity of sauces per rolls ordered either. Overall, I must say I will continue my visits at the Davie location not Pembroke Pines."
12/20/2020,1,"This is my second time coming here. First time, food was cold and blah. Second time, the brown rice was hard and cold."
6/17/2020,3,not sure why i called ahead to place an order only to be waiting 30 mins for my food to sit behind this girl for 20 mins while she's entering orders into the computer and guy in the back is ONLY concerned about making drinks???? nova location would never do me like this
2/12/2020,5,"Delicious!! Totally recommend the bubble tea here! We tried the crunch roll and it was amazing, really big and tasty. Hubby got a noodle bowl also delicious. Nice people, good service. We live walking distance from this restaurant so we will come back."
1/10/2021,5,Bento is amazing every time. I am always full with atleast 5 pieces of sushi left from the sushi combo box. You will not be disappointed with any food from Bento
1/26/2020,5,Went to the F&F event! Food was great and staff were super friendly! Will be back after their official opening on the 27th!
9/6/2020,2,"The chicken katsu,  Korean bowl, and kids chicken tereyaki were good. We went on a limb and ordered sushi. I've had the rainbow roll twice and the bamboo roll once. First it smells and tastes fishier than fish. I know sushi. I've had sushi from Hawaii to the FL keys so I'm hardly a novice. This is by far the worst and it's made me sick both times. Actually the last time I had their sushi, a piece of tuna fell off my rainbow roll as I picked it up and the rice under the fish was stained and pigmented from the fish. That tells me the roll was not made fresh and that the fish had been sitting on the roll for quite some time. I will NEVER eat here again. The only reason they got the 2 stars was because the cooked food was good but the sushi was not worth the food poisoning. Oh and if you're thinking, why did I try the sushi twice after 1 bad experience, well my husband ate the first time and had no issue so I thought it was just me but we noticed it was when I ate the sushi and had same symptoms. This place is exorbitantly expensive for selling expired food."
9/4/2020,4,"Been eating here several times, it is not consistent in portion and in taste.  Overall it is still a good meal option.  Just hate to have a good meal and the next is not so good.  Ordered poke bowl mainly.  Curry is surprisingly good.  Steak is on the salty side for my taste.  Give 4 stars because I will still go back at least one more time."
2/29/2020,3,"First time coming here, I placed a takeout order. I order the sushi combo that comes with a full Cali roll & choice of two 4pc classic rolls. I prefer to have cream cheese in my sushi, I asked to add it and I was told no, which is very unusual for a sushi restaurant because sushi is made to order ... however I also ordered a rice bowl for someone who is vegetarian, so of course we don't want any protein(meat) options, instead they'd prefer to add asparagus ....couldn't do that either. I'm curious if this restaurant limits their modifications because if so, I wouldn't be coming back. However, it was still the soft opening, so maybe another chance later on. On to the taste of the food. Wasn't too bad, the rice bowl lacked flavor. Other than that, sushi was pretty good. Really liked the special mex roll."
9/17/2020,2,"I think that the price are very high for what they give you, I got a noodle bowl and taste like the whole bottle of soy sauce was poured into it, my husband had a fried rice bowl with steak and he got 6 little pieces of steak and a whole lot of soy sauce (we counted it) the price was 40.00, will never order again"
7/12/2020,5,I ordered the brisket soup and oh em gee it was sooooooo good!! My hubby had the poke and a sushi roll of some kind and also enjoyed it
12/20/2020,1,"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would! This is the 3rd time I place an order, whether on the phone, or online and when I get there at least 10-15 mins after the estimated arrival time, it's still not ready!!! This last time I went I placed an order at 10:47am to pick up at 11:30am. I get there at 11:45am in a rush to get my food and go and there was no sign of my order. The employees were all looking at each other cluelessly and when I asked for a manager to refund me they said there wasn't one but I would get refunded on my card in a couple days. I called later and spoke to the manager, Ingrid I believe, and she mentioned that she had been there all day, and her only solution was to next time ask for a manager to make the order or call and not place any orders online, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE WHY MUST I CALL IF THERE IS AN ONLINE SYSTEM? EVEN WHEN I DO CALL THEY STILL DON'T GET IT RIGHT. Super unfortunate that this location SUCKS."
4/5/2020,1,"I understand we are all going through difficult times.  However, there are still ways to manage situations appropriately.  We ordered takeout.  When we got home , they gave my son soy sauce instead of Terriyaki.  He couldn't eat it.  We called to speak to a manager to get a new one made and we would pick it up. He hung up.  My husband went to the location.  The manager would not expedite the order but said we would have to wait for all the orders ahead of us, which was about 30 minutes.  We got a refund.  Not cool.  This is the time to build your customer service, when businesses are hurting. We won't be back."
5/29/2020,5,First time here at Bentos. Super clean atmosphere. Great service. The food was fresh & delicious. Mike the manager was super professional & checked on us frequently. Jayla was our server she was the sweetest. Def will be back.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the portions were smaller for how expensive it was. The ginger salad could've been a lot better. Overall, yummy but pricey!"
3/28/2020,1,This was the biggest waste of $40 ive ever spent in my life before you take time out of your day or waist you're money you can just go to the mall or panda express and get food 100x better than this wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy this place will not last long.
3/3/2020,1,Awful service!!!! I ordered through DoorDash and it took the restaurant 45mins to realize they can't fulfill the order and canceled it! The fact that it took 45 to realize that is ridiculous!! Not to mention the customer service to follow was even worse!
1/28/2020,5,I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl.  They used good quality chicken meat and the teriyaki sauce is not too salty or sweet and very delicious.  Will for sure come back and try other dishes.
2/3/2020,3,"The only reason this is getting three stars is because I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant! I love the food here. I often get the Pao Pao chicken. I used to drive all the way to Davie just to get it. So, I was very excited when I heard about this location opening up. HOWEVER, I was disgusted with the customer service!! I've never been treated this poorly at the Davie location. It seems as if they employ a lot of children with no experience.I wish I had gotten her name. She brought the food to the table, and did not offer any sauce. I tried to hold a conversation with her and ask her what sauces she recommended but, she seemed to be annoyed by my question and had an attitude. I asked her for extra forks and she never returned with any. I had to ask another worker. I could not enjoy my meal because I was so upset at the lack of good customer service.  I asked for her name and I told her I would be speaking with her manager. I called the next day, and no one answered so, I've resorted to yelp.  It really hurts me to write this review considering my love for Bento and that it was a fellow latina sister. However, I would not like to see anyone else treated in this manner."

The Garlic Broccoli Bowl has what looks to be freezer burnt Broccoli, carrot ends that should be discarded, it was cold after the cook asked me to wait an additional 4 minutes and the chicken was awful and gummy. 0/10 would not ever recommend. My first and last time."
