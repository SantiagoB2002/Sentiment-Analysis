8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant. The noodle bowl was delicious, as well. I loved all the different sauce options they had, and how much food you receive for the price. My Husband and I will definitely be back! We love sushi, and we were very pleased with the sushi served here."
9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."
2/26/2022,4,"I liked the noodle bowl with chicken teriyaki. The price is little bit higher than the other restaurants but if you thinking about to try go ahead, you wont regret."
12/31/2020,3,"I frequent the Bento chain quite often, to the point where I have self titled as ""professional bento review writer depending on who you ask"". I am putting it in my bio as soon as I finish writing this. But let's get to it. 3 stars because:Wait time:I used DoorDash to place the order and went to pick it up myself. I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids. It was very quiet prior, with no orders on the shelves waiting for pickup. I walked up and said my name, the employee said it's not ready yet. 20 more minutes go by, it's finally ready. But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent. This is a typical bento, some are better than others. Sometimes they rotate depending on staff or current chefs. But I can't help but wonder if it's a chain, the food should be pretty consistent right? It's not, at least not yet. This visit got the job done, I left full. Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
6/11/2022,1,"Good food but terribly slow. 45 + mins for a bowl of orange chicken?? Are you guys serious? Very slow. Will not be coming back. Waiting for the food is not worth it. When I go to places like bento or similar, I am expecting relatively quick service, maybe my expectations are too high but 45 mins for a bowl of orange chicken is unacceptable."

So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant.

9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."

12/31/2020,3,"I frequent the Bento chain quite often, to the point where I have self titled as ""professional bento review writer depending on who you ask"". I am putting it in my bio as soon as I finish writing this. But let's get to it. 3 stars because:Wait time:I used DoorDash to place the order and went to pick it up myself. I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids. It was very quiet prior, with no orders on the shelves waiting for pickup. I walked up and said my name, the employee said it's not ready yet. 20 more minutes go by, it's finally ready. But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent. This is a typical bento, some are better than others. Sometimes they rotate depending on staff or current chefs. But I can't help but wonder if it's a chain, the food should be pretty consistent right? It's not, at least not yet. This visit got the job done, I left full. Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."

Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."

8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant. The noodle bowl was delicious, as well. I loved all the different sauce options they had, and how much food you receive for the price. My Husband and I will definitely be back! We love sushi, and we were very pleased with the sushi served here."
9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."
2/26/2022,4,"I liked the noodle bowl with chicken teriyaki. The price is little bit higher than the other restaurants but if you thinking about to try go ahead, you wont regret."
12/31/2020,3,"I frequent the Bento chain quite often, to the point where I have self titled as ""professional bento review writer depending on who you ask"". I am putting it in my bio as soon as I finish writing this. But let's get to it. 3 stars because:Wait time:I used DoorDash to place the order and went to pick it up myself. I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids. It was very quiet prior, with no orders on the shelves waiting for pickup. I walked up and said my name, the employee said it's not ready yet. 20 more minutes go by, it's finally ready. But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent. This is a typical bento, some are better than others. Sometimes they rotate depending on staff or current chefs. But I can't help but wonder if it's a chain, the food should be pretty consistent right? It's not, at least not yet. This visit got the job done, I left full. Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
