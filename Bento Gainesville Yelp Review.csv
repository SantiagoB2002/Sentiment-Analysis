9/5/2022,5,"Quick easy Asian food at a decent price.  We go to the one on 13th.  Always clean, always busy, always good food."
11/5/2021,4,Great lunch and friendly service. Fast casual Asian with a big menu including creat your own bowl or poke. Tried a poke bowl with spicy tuna and the miso soup. The soup was spot on and yummy. The bowl was good and toppings were fresh. Staff was friendly and courteous. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you. #eatatbento $$
11/5/2021,1,"I come to Bento just starving before studying for an exam, and I order a orange chicken meal. I barely have time to look at my food as I'm preparing to work but as I look down, I am mortified. Orange chicken, more like PINK chicken. My chicken is raw with minimal streaks of white meat. I can't even return it anymore because it's too late and I'll just have to starve tonight. I'm feeling the salmonella particles pile in my stomach and I'm extremely disappointed in this bento."
3/8/2021,5,"Ordered Ubereats to my officeDelivered in minutes by a courteous  runner. Zen Garden roll, a vegetarian and delicious option with crunchy tofu and explosion of flavors melting on your  mouth Hawaiian bowl with marinated tuna and mango delicious and fulfilling"
8/30/2022,3,Great for a quick dinner. The rice bowls and noodle bowls are GENEROUS in size. If you are a fish lover/sushi lover... this is NOT the place for you.The service makes up for everything. Everyone was super nice and helpful.
8/15/2022,1,"Worst place to eat in Gainesville. If you order be prepared to watch 15 more people come in and order then get their food before you. Also, they delete negative reviews."
10/25/2022,3,"Food is always good, but it's super overpriced and the staff here are slow and not very friendly."
8/24/2022,1,My friend got horrible food poisoning from the sushi at this place. She was so ill for days and visibly looked unwell for hours after consuming the food.
5/11/2022,3,Sub par pan Asian but still love going to the Archer n newberry location more often. I think they could do a better job at the sushi component
4/11/2022,5,"Never have any thing less than a great experience at this Bento. I am always greeted with a smile and warm welcome as I enter. The employees are extremely patient and do not make you feel rush or pressured in any way. They will bring your food to your table if you wish to stay, and food comes out pretty quick for the amount of business they receive. The tables are always clean and the booths are very comfortable. The food comes out hot and well-prepared, with soy sauce and other common necessities at the table. I can confidently say that the Miami Roll or the Vegetable Udon Noodle Bowl are two of the best meals I've ever had. They also have a fountain soda machine offering free refills with many options. All around, one of my favorite places to eat in Gainesville, can't ever see them going wrong!"
10/21/2020,4,"I was near this location for a meeting and wanted a quick lunch. Bento is predictable and this meal fit the bill. I ordered online, did not modify my food, and I was happy with the outcome. I had the TNT roll, Chicken Tempura roll, and a ginger salad. It was a good amount of food. The quality of the sushi is a step below Volcanic and other better places.The food was ready at the requested time (I ordered ahead) and the location seemed very clean when I walked in. Napkins and chopsticks were already in the back, which was convenient, so I grabbed it and took off."
2/17/2019,4,"For quick pan-asian food with a varied menu and decent prices, Bento is a great option, especially for lunch.I was really impressed with the cleanliness od the restaurant and the wonderful cashier who took my order. I was quite indecisive about my selection, so the cashier asked me what I had a taste for, if I liked spicy foods, and he even told me his own personal favorites. And his suggestion was spot on--the red curry katsu pork. I ordered it over white rice. The curry sauce comes on the side so you can spread it on your dish to your liking. If you like panko breading, then this dish is for you.The orange chicken was deliciously crispy and flavorful. You get a huge portion, so the lunch size was more than enough.Service was quick, staff were friendly, and I'll definitely be returning"
5/20/2022,5,"Amazing. Food is so fresh and yummy! One dish came out a little late, but they are so kind and brought it right out."
5/5/2020,3,"I want to love Bento. But I can't. Dining in is a pretty decent experience. Delivery is where it all falls apart. Of all the times I've ordered delivery, now more than ever,it's been correct 25% of the time. I'm not sure if this happens to anyone else, but for my protein for my sesame rice bowl I order tofu and extra protein because I'd like more tofu. Somehow either that means tofu and chicken or just chicken.This attention to detail isn't a one time thing. This has happened so much that it's not even something I want to or have time to deal with.I really want to support them being a Gainesville restaurant, but I find it difficult to do this when they can't get my main protein correct more times I can count."
3/23/2020,5,Ordered on Postmates and it was great! Usually get sushi-2-go but will be going here now. Prices were fair and packaging was nice too with no spills.
9/18/2021,1,"I ordered off Uber Eats so the temperature and presentation may not be exactly like the restaurant, but the taste doesn't change. I ordered the orange chicken with noodles (I also payed extra for shrimp) and the veggie stir fry rice bowl. I have to admit that the orange chicken was delicious, but the noodles were ok and they did NOT include the shrimp I payed extra for! The veggie stir fry was extremely amateur: the rice was that nice sticky consistency but bland tasting, the veggies were unseasoned and tasteless, and I barely received any chicken like it said it would include. The only flavor in the rice bowl was the sauce which is pathetic. I was originally going to give 2 stars until I realized the shrimp was missing like wow. Never ordering from there again, I'd rather walk across the street to Publix and eat the raw chicken."
3/26/2020,4,Best Asian food in Gainesville. The place was crowded when I went there  at 1pm but it depends on the time. The staff prepared my food quickly.I ordered the best Sushi I've ever had in Gainesville. The place was soo nice and not that expensive.
3/4/2019,3,"With a new location across from UF Campus, this Bento is just a few steps away from Heavener Hall and underneath the Standard. In regards to food and service, it echoes the quality of other Bento locations; employees are willing to help with your order, and you get your food relatively fast. Moreover, the interior has sufficient seating, and is nicely decorated. They offer a parking voucher for the nextdoor garage, but otherwise, finding street parking is a nightmare. My biggest reservation about Bento is their price point. For Asian-fusion cuisine, their kitchen menu items can be easily found at any Chinese takeout restaurant. Moreover, their dishes range upwards from about $9; a mixed vegetable noodle bowl with steak is already around $12. The amount of food that you get is not worth the price, especially when other takeout restaurants have lunch specials around $7."
3/19/2019,1,Out of Pad Thai and white rice. Only one drawer accepts  cash. This is a sad place to eat.  $16.59 for a bento box combo. The interior is similar to any fast food place.Miso Soup was obviously from a can.  Food was all cold. Not sure how your cook green beans so they shrivel and are rubber. I recognize this is meant for college kids but it was just really bad. Do not waste your time or money here
10/19/2019,2,"Meh. I came here because I really wanted miso soup, and I did get miso soup, so I won't complain about that. I also ordered pad Thai with tofu. The tofu was decent but the pad Thai was pretty gross and I didn't want to eat very much of it. And it took about 20 minutes for my food to come out. This is a decent option if you're dying for lots of vegetarian options, but I wouldn't come back here again."
3/10/2021,1,"Had a very unpleasant meal contemplating what was in my chicken. Egg? Who knows. Totally gross and will never be eating from here again. My Taro slush wasn't even purple, I have no idea what they prepared for me. The sushi rice was just a layer of mush. I wouldn't recommend this place to a single soul. What a disappointing and distasteful experience."
7/23/2021,5,"love their pad thai with pao pao chicken, make sure to get extra sauce in the side. this dish is life changing. if you like a little spice, definitely get this. the pad thai beats both the white rice and fried rice. we also had the Mexican roll which was really good, but the main entree outdid everything. the vanilla milk tea and strawberry milk slush were super good and recommended by the cashier. great experience and pls try the pao pao chicken it is life changing."
11/4/2019,3,"I enjoyed the pad thai here, the spice was just right. Passion fruit smoothie was tasty but I felt a bit too much ice for a smoothie. Overall, not bad, would return to try the sushi rolls."
6/19/2019,1,"Red curry tasted completely off today!Been eating Bento's curry katsu for many years, and it's usually awesome. Always ate my whole bowl! Today the red curry was completely horrible! Not sure if it was the whole batch or maybe something was wrong with just bowl. It didn't taste like it went bad, but more of a chemically taste to it. Maybe cleaning residue was in my bowl or the cookware? Not wanting to be difficult, I tried to eat it. Halfway, I had to stop and tell them about it. They were super nice and asked me if I wanted different curry on the side or remake of the order. I politely declined because my appetite was gone. Just wanted them to know something might be wrong with the curry, and that was pretty much the end of it. Consistency isn't too bad with Bento, but I've needed things remade before. I still love their food, but today was unacceptable.Side note: - The pork option for curry kastu is no longer offered. - Different noodles were used in the Lo Mein today; not sure if just this instance, this location, or a new thing. - Mini udon was not available at the time of ordering. TL;DR: poor quality and consistency today"
1/21/2019,5,"This new Bento is Awesome sauce with a capital A! The long wait is finally over and the new Bento location in The Standard right next to UF is finally open! Everyone is so super excited I was so happy to go in and give this place a try!  Bento started right here in Gainesville with the location on Newberry Road. They have now opened 12 locations in Gainesville, Jax, Tally and Orlando and are starting to move to South Florida! This new location inside The Standard is awesome. You have a big dining room, the colors look vibrant and great, they have a build your own Poke bowl station, and a long sushi line. You can get all your Bento favorites like Poke Poke Chicken (Spicy Mayo Chicken), fried rice, beer and broccoli, and Bento Boxes galore!  The staff here and the store manager are so nice and will accommodate you from the moment you come in to the moment you leave! I love this new Bento and since I work at UF will be coming here so much more!"
6/19/2020,2,"I love the food here, when it's good. It's definitely hit or miss though, no consistency in quality or quantity. I always order poke bowls and this last time was so off. Didn't have pretty much all the toppings I asked for, barely any lettuce, which was my base & a lot of it was black and gross. I ordered teriyaki steak, but got some rubbery chicken. Paid for extra sauces and didn't get those. Ordered Rangoons...didn't get those either! I don't think I'll be ordering from here anymore."
3/18/2020,5,"Bento is such a go-to if you're really craving sushi, they have it all! The staff is always kind and the service is definitely fast paced (:"
3/27/2020,2,The dictionary defines average as typical; common; ordinary. I can say with full confidence that this restaurant epitomizes the word average. My food arrives fresh and in a timely manner...sometimes. My requested sauces are included with the meal...rarely. And my girlfriend enjoys when we order this for a quiet night in...never. For the employees of this establishment I have but one question: WHERE ARE YOU HIDING MY SAUCE?If you want your meal as dry as the Sahara I suggest ordering from this restaurant. They will not let you down.
12/10/2019,1,"It's really sad that I had a poor experience at Bentos as it is one of my favorite places to eat. I walked in and had a pleasant experience ordering at the counter, the ladies up there were extremely kind. I ordered Yellowtail Sashimi, at 11:30am today and once I received my ordered, I asked the girl who brought it to me if she could ask the chef to cut the slices thinner. The chef did and when it was brought back to me, the slices were thinner but there was still only three pieces. I was under the impression that he would take the original slices and cut them in half. So now my original order is half the size. I decided to get up and talk to the chef to ask him to give me the original order but cut the big pieces thinner so I can get the food that I paid for. The chef was a tall, bearded man, probably in his later twenties, who then proceeded to argue with me. I asked him, ""Excuse me, my original order had more fish and now it's half the size, I just wanted the original pieces to be sliced thinner. Is that possible?""He replied and said, ""I was not told to do that. I was told to cut them thinner so I provided thinner pieces.""So I said once again, ""I understand, but is it possible to get the original pieces just sliced thinner?""He replied very rudely and said, ""yes it is. But I was not told to do that.""I stood there, staring blankly for a moment with no action from him, then asked again, ""May I please get my full order just turn the three pieces into six.""He snatched my plate and said, ""I wasn't told to do that.""He then proceeded to use the same pieces and just added extra pieces and cut the meat in half rather than slicing it while every employee in the restaurant paused and stared.He didn't look up at me and shoved the plate towards me.I truly have never been so surprised in my life to be treated in such a disrespected way. I've worked food services jobs for the past 12 years and not one of my employers would have tolerated such terrible customer service presented by their employee. To the jack ass who gave me my food and slammed the sushi door, first of all, calm down. I don't know what happened in your day that you have to ruin everyone else's. Put a smile on your face and learn to be patient and kind, it will return the favor to you one day."
10/5/2019,5,This place is straight fire. Great Menu with everything you could want and many different options to try. Food comes out relatively quick and in location close to campus
10/6/2019,3,Always delicious food. This location specifically is extremely slow at serving food. Sushi is always backed up. waiting for sushi here when I've been here has always been at least 40 mins for even 4 pieces. One out of five times I've gotten non sushi food here it taken less than 15 mins. Rest has been over 30 mins.
1/16/2020,5,"bento you can shine sushi,Chinese food,Thai food more convenient.food is great just one problem too busy need to wait for long time."
9/15/2020,5,The food here is amazing. I've had a great experience with deliveries from here. I recommended the special mexican roll with spicy mayo! Great job overall.
7/14/2019,3,"I come here to get a poke bowl almost weekly, but lately I've been noticing that between two and three ingredients I request for my poke bowl are not available each time I ask for them.  It shouldn't be difficult to keep simple ingredients in stock, and I come away frustrated after each experience at Bento even though the food is good."
3/15/2020,4,They have some nice meals and boba tea. It's a pretty convenient location next to campus and overall well maintained. The staff are pretty friendly.
2/10/2019,2,"I love Bento restaurants, as much as I love living in Gainesville. I loved this location when I first visited a few weeks ago. However, on a rainy evening tonight - it was a complete disappointment. I understand that the orders can take longer as it was completely packed (long line and customers standing around throughout the hall to be seated), but I do not get how food can get undercooked (hard and chewy udon noodle) and cold (tempura shrimp was almost under the room temperature).Most disappointing aspect was the response done by the kitchen staff for Japanese curry (for curry pork katsu bowl) for my order - it was extremely watery. I believe someone decided to add more water to the near empty curry sauce pot due to high demand, resulting watered down curry. When I asked for an explanation, the hall server staff member told me I will be provided with another curry. We waited for 15 minutes without being told that it was going to take longer - when it finally came to us, our food was already cold and no longer crunchy. We wish they told us in advance.Again, taking longer to cook for each order due to high volume of customers is completely understandable. However what I have difficult time to tolerate is the practice of willing to sacrifice the quality to meet the excess of demand, just to get by one shift.I really hope this change for the restaurant soon, so I can come back again in the near future."
6/6/2019,1,Very slow service. Waited almost 30 minutes for Our food and it arrived to the table cold.
5/17/2019,1,Ordered for delivery from here. They delayed my order for 2 and a half hours and counting. Do not recommend if you're hungry.
9/4/2019,1,"Ordered take out, waited for 20 minutes. Finally went to the desk to see 4 workers standing around and talking while only one was running the register. Come to find out, my food was waiting on the take out trey and they never let me know until I walked up. To top it all off, they completely messed up my order. This is not the first time I've been upset with bento. Will not be returning here."
3/16/2019,5,"I had Bento for the first time today and it was an extremely pleasant surprise! I don't typically eat rice or Asian food for that matter, so two years into going to UF and I finally tried it for lunch. I took a while to order since I wasn't sure what I'd like and I am super indecisive, so my cashier Britney walked me through the whole menu and recommended her favorite dishes. She was so patient and helpful so I am grateful for that! I came at a good time too because it was not very busy. As for the restaurant, it seemed very clean and it had reasonable prices. It is a little on the higher end, but you seriously get what you pay for. Also it being so convenient right near campus is a huge plus for me. Overall, I was satisfied, so I'll be seeing you again :)"
1/30/2020,5,"I love bento, it's so yummy & close to campus which is super convenient. I always get the bento box which is a little bit of everything that they offer. Their bubble tea is also very good :) Always quick service too. I have a peanut allergy and they are always very accommodating to my needs-- they write that I have an allergy in my order so I feel safe eating here too."
4/5/2019,1,I come to bento all the time on archer and it's perfect. This place has ran out of pad Thai TWICE. How do u do that??? So bad
2/5/2020,5,"I absolutely love this place! I am basically a regular here. The location is super convenient and the service is very good, although they tend to be a little slow when it gets busy. The food is very good, I enjoy every item I have tried on the menu. The sushi is very good and one of the best places around here for it. Overall I would highly recommend!"
11/19/2019,5,"Fried rice is always a go-to for me at Bento. The price and portioning are ideal. I go here a lot after class so the wait is never long, both to pay and to get my food. Love the free sauces! Wish they offered sweet tea!"
3/24/2019,1,"Very poor service I waited over 30 minutes for my food and over 30 minutes just waiting and ordering. I spent over an hour for a half ass bowl, because they were out of almost every item in stock including avocado asparagus mushrooms and broccoli. Pretty embarrassing to be a ""high-class"" quick service restaurant when there's nothing in stock and food takes over an hour to prepare. They are highly staffed and still it takes this long. It is actually ridiculous."
7/9/2019,5,great place. service is always fast and my order was never wrong/ poorly made. I have always had great experiences here. Their sushi and poke bowls are amazing. The fish is so fresh and tasty. Everything is prepared to order. Very clean and well kept
8/31/2019,1,"Yeah I used to work at a sushi restaurant, Sushi and Pan in Miami, Fl, and this place does not compare. Bento overcharges for sushi, and for the overcharged sushi it's, at best, mediocre. I got the Red Dragon roll w out cream cheese and instead of spicy mayo, i asked for eel sauce, which was just a line of sauce across the roll. The overall taste was bland, and to be honest super unfilling."
5/13/2019,5,"Loved Bento and their Japanese dishes. It is very hard to locate Japanese place in Florida that serves great Japanese food. Their food is served pretty fast, clean property, and great customer service. If you want great Japanese food, this is the place!"
1/23/2019,1,"I was hospitalized after eating a Special Mexican Roll from here two days ago. My food poisoning was awful and when I shared the news with my friends, THREE other people told me they got food poisoning from Bento too. Wouldn't recommend to ANYONE."
7/24/2022,5,Great food! This came in very well made boxes that made the food feel luxurious! One of the best noodles and chicken I've ever had
1/14/2022,3,"First off the staff here is very friendly and provided excellent service. My review is primarily about the food and the pricing here. There is a $4.00 upcharge for fried rice. That seems very high upcharge for a dish that is already on the pricier side. I tried the poke bowl with the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was pretty chewy, and the flavors simply were not there for me. I ended up taking some of my husband's pineapple chicken since I didn't like what I ordered. The pineapple chicken tasted really good, but the overall price just seems high. The poke bowl seemed more reasonably priced, but sadly the chicken was not the star of the dish. The fountain machine was broken here, but thankfully the staff was friendly and brought our drinks to us. Overall it was an alright lunch experience."
1/19/2022,5,"Bento is one of my favorite lunch spots! My favorite dish is the udon Katsu soup bowl. The soup was piping hot, and the chicken was super crispy. The portions were just right too. I also recommend the teriyaki chicken bowl! On tuesdays, the teriyaki chicken bowl has a discount!"
3/14/2022,5,"My poke bowl was so beautiful! The fish was fresh and the produce was also! They were very generous on the rice, but I was okay with that. Prices are comparable with other poke locations in the area but better quality in my opinion. My boyfriend got the steak bento and he seemed to enjoy his meal. I would definitely come back here!"
12/17/2020,5,"Nice selection of rolls, with the ""classic"" rolls still fancier than other places. They are a couple of dollars more than other places, but the sushi is really good. I got rolls to go. Ordering online was easy, but we still had to wait a few minutes after we showed up for the scheduled pickup. The site has pictures of all the rolls in case you are unsure what you're getting.I got the Mt. Fuji roll (krab, shrimp tempura, krab delite, scallion, eel sauce) $9. It's a roll with toppings included. My friend got the red dragon (tuna, shrimp tempura, krab, avocado, cream cheese, masago, spicy mayo) $11.50. So the signature rolls aren't much more than the classic and that have some interesting combos to try something new.There's a lot of parking, ordering is easy, and the rolls were tasty. They also have bento boxes (hence the name), bowls, and boba tea. A great variety if you want to come with someone who isn't into sushi."
1/29/2022,5,"We were very impressed with the food, service, and takeout experience! We decided to try two bento boxes (sesame seed with shrimp and sichuan with tofu) plus the egg rolls. All were delicious! Ingredients were fresh and food was well-prepared. The order was packed up nicely and it was ready to go early! We will be back to try other bentos and bowls."
6/11/2021,5,I LOVE BENTO! Like theeee best place for me when eating a poke bowl! I was super happy to enjoy my bowl as it's been before covid since I last had it. Omg my bowl hit the spot and some! It made me super happy that the bowl was everything and more than I imagined! I've had their sushi rolls and other stuff but I always come here just for the poke bowls! It always feels like it was made with LOVE! Very satisfying for sure! I think this time I ate a little more than my eyes could handle but it's definitely worth it!
9/16/2020,5,"There are several Bento's in the GNV area, but this one and the Newberry road location are consistently good. I pick up the phone, press 1, place my order, and know exactly what I'm going to get. There's a comfort in that, especially if you eat not only because you need to. On a typical day, I find myself lovingly looking at their Chicken Veggie Stir fry bowl, placed comfortably over a plush mountain of white rice. Sitting next to me is my other half, devouring Shrimp Veggie Stir Fry. (he took my advice), but his has a side of Teriyaki, which tastes amazing in a warm reunion with the stir fry sauce. I'm not sure why, but Shrimp is unavailable as a protein to be combined with Teriyaki sauce, so I just ask for it on the side and hack the system. You get bang for your buck here, there's no doubt about that. It's usually fast, and hits the spot. If I find myself getting a Bento craving, I hold off until around 2:30-4:00pm, this is when they are least busy. They'll tell you it's 15-20 minutes, but it's usually done in 5 minutes. Arrive early if you can, as my orders have gotten cold quickly up on the take-out shelf. The interior is lacking a bit, leaves something to be desired and not really inviting. It's simple, you can watch the Sushi Chefs do their thing, or enjoy a spot outside in the sun/daily down pour. Depending on your luck."
2/25/2022,3,Benny Hannah is pissed off. Undercooked hard white rice. OK stop right there. Cooking white rice in a rice cooker should be the easiest thing ever. How does an Asian restaurant filled with non-Asian employees miss-fire on the rice? This is what happens when churn and burn fast casual gets a hold of Japanese cuisine.  Spent $16. Actual value $5. Fix the rice!Chicken Bento 2/21/22 Dinner:
2/8/2022,2,"First timer and last time, eating here. What you get for the money, it's not worth it. The food flavor was great but did amount was very disappointing. Look at the pictures for proof!"
4/8/2020,3,"Bento is an A-OK restaurant to go to in Gainesville. No, it's not going to blow you away because of exquisite food or decor. You go because it has become a Gainesville classic, a go to hangout place if you will. If you spend any amount of time in Gainesville as a student attending UF (Go Gators!), chances are you will find yourself coming here at least once. If you happen to attend any of the on campus Asian organizations, chances are you probably lost track of the amount of time you've been here and spent here lol.As for the food, it's solid. It satisfies you when you crave it and it fills you up. Like this time as I was passing through Gainesville, I got the shrimp tempura udon soup. It was a good portion size, not too expensive, and the shrimp was fried well. Nice and crispy on the outside while not having too much batter on it. While it won't compare to the food at say Sushi Matsuri, Bento will always hold a special place in my heart. Dropping by here and getting food will always make me feel like I'm back home in the Swamp"
12/4/2021,1,"Bento is supposed to be an easy and quick lunch/dinner stop, and somehow my orders are never ready when they're supposed to be, and something is always missing. This is now the 4th time that my boba tea has come with no boba even after paying for extra. Honestly just a waste of time and money ordering at the Archer road location."
8/10/2021,5,"If you like a little bit of spicy-ness, Get the bento box with gochujang (korean pepper paste) chicken.It is sooo DELICIOUS!Everything else in the bento box was fresh, crisp, clean and it did not leave me with that heavy feeling you get from burgers or pizza."
3/27/2022,4,"Stopped in for a late dinner based on a recommendation. We ordered a roll of sushi, which was nice and fresh and two rice bowls - both of which were really good. As we watched food come out, everything looked good and the portions looked large. I'll definitely go back - maybe to this location the next time I'm in town, or to one of their other locations closer to home."
1/11/2020,4,"This is very disappointing as I always loved Bento. However, I found black bits that looked like burnt pieces or possibly even dried grease from I cleaned stoves and oven. My whole food is inedible and possible dangerous to eat. Very disappointed! Edit: I spoke to a person named Dalia and she handled the reorder very well. Thanks to her the stars went up. Good customer service."
12/16/2019,3,"Awhile back I had couple friends in Gainesville going to school at UF.A long time ago maybe 10 years ago this place was the place to go for lunch. Coming to Gainesville again reminded me of the old times and I stop by while driving back to Atlanta.This place use to be mad packed and waiting took forever.When I arrived, the place looks the same and was still poplar by the looks of it. I order same thing I order from back in the days Spicy pork and my friend order Tempura Udon, we also added Volcano roll.Our food came out pretty fast but our Volcano roll took awhile.For some reason my spicy pork was a little sour which didn't seem right.Ate about 2-3 bites then just couldn't eat it.The udon however was the bomb. My friend love the udon and it was great.Our volcano roll came out after we were done with our main.Volcano was decent but wasn't like how it use to be or it could be back in the days we were young and we could have ate anything at that time.But coming back here brings a lot of memories and as great.If your in town for some decent food or a warm Udon this is the place.They also sell Bubble tea."
4/13/2021,4,"Bento is a consistent 4 stars for me. It's above average, not spectacular but not horrible. I ordered a poke bowl for delivery with 2 proteins, salmon and yellow tail. The bowl itself was good, nothing in the bowl was bad. I appreciated the add ons that were added in. My favorites are the wakame salad, edamame, and ginger. If I had to make one suggestion, I'd say there was not enough protein. I ordered two proteins thinking there would be a decent amount of salmon and yellow tail. Unfortunately, they skimped on the protein as there were only a few pieces of each. I feel as if the poke bowl from Poke Station gives much more protein compared to Bento. Both poke bowls are comparable quality wise. Because of this, I slightly prefer the Poke Station bowls over the Bento ones. The positive thing about Bento is that there is more variety in food options compared to Poke Station. Overall, I'd pick Poke Station if I wanted a poke bowl specifically, but Bento for the variety."
6/6/2021,1,Terrible sushi rolls. Very small and flavorless. They are very skimpy on the sauce and my rolls were very salty. I've had better sushi from grocery stores.
9/7/2021,5,"Fresh food (chicken teriyaki) and great service! Their manager, Elena, and all staff was extremely attentive and accommodating!"
12/19/2021,5,"Love Bentos! Great value for even better quality food. Sushi has become a recent favorite for me. Elena was outstanding! Food took a little long, so she offered my a courtesy drink. Very impressed with the customer service."
12/23/2021,1,Service took way too long for our food from the kitchen. My bento box with veggie stir fry entree was covered in way too much mediocre sauce and the vegetables were over cooked. The whole meal cost nearly $80 for 2 adults and 3 kids for less food and lower quality than you get at a Chipotle (and chipotle costs half as much). I will not be going to one of these restaurants again.
11/11/2020,3,"We stopped here on a road trip and while the food was decent, the customer service and wait were not. There was definitely and inconsistency in urgency and speed among the staff. The team putting the food in to-go bags were so slow. They took so much time putting things together after the food was ready. I could see bags just waiting behind the counter to be put on the grab and go shelves. And with all the time they took, an extra 20 minutes after my order should have been ready, they didn't include any silverware or chopsticks in the bag. Luckily we had a couple packaged plastic forks in the glove compartment or else eating the rice bowl in the car would've been difficult. I understand a dinner rush, but there seemed to be some room for improvement. The food was good though and was exactly what we were looking for"
3/27/2022,1,"Don't ask for them to put rice and meat in separate bowls. It blows their mind and apparently can't be done. I get that it's a different ask maybe slightly out of the ordinary. But seriously looking dumbfounded about wanting the rice and chicken in separate bowls and the ""manager"" saying just can't be done is a riot."
3/26/2022,1,"Not only did we have to wait a long time, the food was drowning in oil, sauce and, ""flavor."" It was overwhelming and upset our stomachs. First time getting food here, because my girlfriend wanted Asian food, and probably the last time."
7/23/2018,3,"Bento is one of those places that you usually know what to expect every single time. I went on a Thursday night and was not surprised to see it was busy and the line was longer. Usually larger groups go together and pay individually since it is counter service and I wish they did a better job of encouraging them to move so the line moves.Bento is OK Chinese, Japanese fusion food. It's overpriced and they give you a decent amount. I got a Bento box with orange chicken and brown rice. It came with green beans, a side salad, and fried wonton wrapper with a sweet glaze. My friend and I also split a Volcano roll. Again this was OK but way over priced for food that I can get elsewhere cheaper. I usually come to Bento with others but it's not my preferred place to go solo if I want a quick and cheap meal."
10/10/2020,1,"I ordered takeout from this restaurant last night & I was extremely disappointed. I ordered Szechuan chicken bowl & I checked the menu multiple times to make sure that the dish didn't have nuts since I am severely allergic to tree nuts. The online menu states ""carrot, string beans, broccoli, scallion sweet + spicy garlic sauce"" & I still had an allergic reaction. Either the kitchen isn't clean & cross contamination took place or they are not straightforward with their menu. I would not recommend eating here if you have severe allergies."
10/17/2021,3,"food was ok. it was very expensive and when we got our food, there was no ginger sauce on the ginger salad. also i ordered with noodle soup and there weren't many udon noodles in it along with only on price of bok choy and they didn't include a lot of the stuff it usually comes with."
5/6/2019,1,"Bento has highly disappointed me.The store opens at 11:30, I got there at 11:35. I was third in line and a huge rush of people came in behind me. I ordered a poke bowl (which I'm happy they added a mini version cause the regular is a decent size if you get it with rice). And I also ordered the lovers boba tea (and they ran out of boba too on a Monday morning). The lady who took my ordered was visibly stressed and answered the store phone in the middle of me trying to get my order in. I should note that I am aware bento does take their time to have their food out. Within 5 minutes I got my boba tea and it was refreshing! But 30 minutes went by and I noticed the people behind me in line already got their food. I went up and asked how long my food was going to take because at that point I was already on a time crunch. I did not have a complicated order, it was a mini and regular poke bowl. They asked me if I had it to go and I confirmed I did. And the staff told me well we take priority in dine in first and then take out. According to the staff, it was their policy. They asked if I wanted a refund and I said no, I came here for a service and it hasn't been provided. I've waited for over half an hour, I've waited for so long, I just wanted my food. A refund would not have fixed the time I already spent there. The policy makes no sense because what difference would it have made if I made it for dine in and then asked for to go boxes? On top of that, I had to ask for the sauces I ordered because they didn't put the right sauce I asked for in the bag. The food itself was adequate, the wonton chips I ordered were soggy. The soda machine had no carbonation so it was unavailable. I know things can go wrong at restaurants but you should avoid the customer trying to see that and provide the service they have paid for. Bento has highly disappointed me."
4/19/2020,4,"Was looking something for everyone on a Friday night stuck in the house. Dinner and a movie sounded good, so after looking through options everyone agreed on Bento. A place we only typically drop in when at shopping centers or out of town. We ordered, and got quick contactless delivery. The food arrived hot in organized bentos box containers with out anything crossing over to the wrong place!! Everyone finished and enjoyed the meal. Was a great way to break up the boredom for the kids. We also got a variety of milk teas and shake with bobas. The kids where happy and the night in seamed like a success."
10/27/2017,3,First time here. Atmosphere: chill and good for casual dining or even a date.Service: food was promptly cooked and staff was very friendly and courteous.Food: the food was decent. My spicy beef bulgogi was a bit too salty for my tastes but the spicy creamy chicken was very good but the pieces of chicken were way too breaded. The portion sizes are ok but if you are really hungry then one bowl might not be enough for you.Overall I think this place is very good for casual dining or even group dining. Would recommend anyone in the area to try it out at least once.
11/8/2016,4,"Four years, Bento, four years without you.Had food here while in town with a friend of mine. The place is even more busy than I remember! Parking now has quite become atrocious compared to back in the day, hence why I am taking off one star.Other than that, the food is still a good bang for your buck. I treated my friend for his birthday and with his garbage disposal ways and my food intake, I still didn't make it to $30. We ordered miso soup, chicken stirfry, some nigiri, and a Mongolian beef bowl (or at least I think that's what it was). Everything was delicious, and well, my friend stuffed himself and I had food leftovers.I found out now that they apparently have expanded to South Florida, so I'll be visiting to see if it's as good as this location. Until next time, Bento. We have finally met again, and well, given that you've franchised in my neck of the woods, it definitely won't be another four years without you."
4/26/2019,5,"Awesome pan Asian food for a quick meal! Great service and great quality. Most of my typical meals here are the sushi, Vietnamese pork chop bowl, or the poke bowl. Cannot go wrong with the bento box either. Definitely recommend!"
5/5/2020,3,Do not order delivery. Only go there if you order tofu. Somehow the chefs at Bento assume tofu can be substituted for chicken. Sure in many respects they look a like. Normally this would come off as a one time mess up and easily forgiven. This has happened a minimum of five different delivery orders from this location. The mid town location did this so many times I started ordering from this one. This local does the same thing. If I'd ordered tofu extra protein I'd get chicken and tofu or just chicken.This review is similar to my mid town review due to the fact that two locations are doing the same thing. When dining in it seems they actually check the ticket for accuracy. But delivery is a gamble I lose enough to stop ordering.
7/22/2021,2,"In the last 6 months or so a poke bowl has risen from $11, to $13, and today they rose to $15. Lunch for 2 with tax is now $32, without tip. $32 feeds a family of 4, ribeye steaks. I'm done."
5/7/2020,1,"Went to grab take out today. Only 2 people in the restaurant at a time, which is fine   Once we waited for our meal, NO Utensils.  We had already left for our appt When I called back was told , YOU HAVE TO ASK!!  WTF was not asked about that nor drinks. Crappy staffing on the register today!!"
1/25/2019,4,"Chicken fried rice tender, edamame great.  Veggie rolls were soggy inside.  Bento box of chicken Katsu is daughter's go to favorite.  Husband had tofu rice bowl.  Didn't realize they offer sake, next visit will try.  Good value for all the food you get.  Eat in or order takeout."
6/13/2016,4,"I can't believe I've never left a review for Bento after all these years. I was enrolled at UF back when this Bento opened (referred to as ""Bento Red"") and I've eaten here countless times. Bento serves their food made-to-order, from hot foods, sushi, boba, and now poke bowls.The ordering area at Red is really cramped, considering how many customers they serve. When I went, they only had 1 register taking orders even though there were a lot of people in line. The other register is a dedicated line for call ahead pick-ups. *PRO-TIP: If you know what you want to order, call ahead!! You'll save a lot of time waiting!!Inside dining is mostly full-service: servers will bring your food to your table, and come around to ask if you need anything during your stay. When you're finished, you leave the dishes on the table and they will clean up.My go-to sushi order is the spicy tuna-salmon don. They pack a LOT of fresh fish on sushi rice and they're very generous with the spicy mayo (but you can customize your bowl the way you like).I tried the new rice-less rolls and had the Surf N Kawaii roll. It has krab, tempura shrimp, tuna, avocado, masago, and eel sauce. It is a great Lo-carb option but you still want sushi."
2/6/2019,4,"Overall, Bento has been a consistently good place to get a quick meal. It's one of those places that you can go to when no one can agree on where to eat. There's plenty of menu options, so almost everyone will find something they like on the menu. I tend to go with the Sriracha Garlic Tofu, and it never lets me down. The tofu is always really crunchy, which I love. While Bento does get really busy, I've never waited unreasonable amount of time for my food. This particular visit, was the only time I've been unhappy with how my food tasted. The broccoli and garlic tofu came out soft and squishy, unlike any of their tofu I've tried before. Additionally, the rice seemed over cooked and soggy. I just wasn't a fan of the flavor in general. I don't think this experience is representative of Bento as a whole, as this was the first time I've been disappointed, and I'm sure I'll be back again soon for another chance."
3/10/2016,3,This review is not in regards to their sushi menu. Pros:I like their spicy miso ramen soup. It's on the menu for a limited time but I hope it becomes a permanent item. It's flavorful and filling. Their Szechuan beef soup had a very tasty broth but the noodles were overcooked the one time I ordered it. Hopefully that's not the norm. Cons:It takes way too long just to order your food sometimes. They almost always only have one cashier at the register. People tend to ask questions about what they are ordering and it's generally just a slow process. They really should have two cashiers to get things moving along. It's frustrating.
7/9/2018,2,"I usually love Bento, I mean, who doesn't? But I won't be returning to this location unfortunately. I always order the same exact thing at Bento, the Spicy Cream Chicken Rice bowl. At one point, it came with these terribly insane huge sliced peppers and string beans. Then, just peppers for whatever reason and I was paying extra for string beans. Recently, I confirmed with both locations that the meal comes with string beans and haven't had an issue with the Newberry location yet. The peppers are WAY too huge for my liking, so I prefer string beans so I go out of my way to ask every time if the ""current"" recipe is peppers & string beans. I did the same this time, the cashier assured me that both were included and I said, ""ya know what. May I have extra?"" She says, ""Sure, but it'll be a dollar extra."" I said, ""No problem! But they come with them already right? [she nods] Great! Then I'll have more than usual because I'm paying extra? Awesome."" Joking but not joking at all. So my friend and I go sit outside and her bowl comes with no veggies (she didn't specify no veggies) and mine comes out with about 20 string beans. 20. Vs. that HUGE bowl, like, did that even look balanced back in the kitchen? The worst part is, I nicely asked the waiter if there was anything to be done because sheesh, I could walk to Wards and bring 3 pounds of string beans back for a buck and you all could only give me THIS? The waiter took it back to the kitchen and brought it right back to me saying, ""yeah that's even more than the usual."" Bleh. You all couldn't make a customer happy by simply adding a few more veggies to a majorly unbalanced bowl. I'll stay away from Bento for a while and when I come back, I'll stick with any other location than this one because customer service is not their strong point."
3/28/2018,4,This location has improved their service size and quality of food over the past few yearsThis is now back to a go to joint for my friends and familyHighly recommend
8/14/2020,5,Had pad thai for the first time in a long time with tofu. Haven't had the pad thai from Bento until today. Really good. Tofu is good. I'm pretty full.
2/17/2020,1,"Was in at 759 pm on 2/16. Placed my order and waited 30 minutes. Many other patrons came in, ordered and picked up their food and left. My take out was simply soup and a sesame rice bowl. Very disappointed, had canceled an order at P.F. Chang's for a 20-30 minute wait thinking I could've got in and out of here quicker..Even sadder was the fact that my wife had to ask where her order was, and apparently it had been sitting there for a while."
1/17/2018,3,"I used to love Bento, but they always get rid of the best items on their menu. The parking is so limited, and half of the time the soda machine is out of what you want to drink. I'm not sure if management changed, but the restaurant certainly has. Bring back the tuna tataki :("
5/10/2018,3,"If you need a quick meal, Bento is always a dependable place to go. With a diverse menu of sushi and kitchen entrees, there are various options to choose from. However, I have seen Bento increase their prices over the years; a rice/noodle bowl or sushi bowl can range from $8 - $12 now. Even so, they give you a decent amount of food.I do enjoy that Bento is relatively quick with preparing their meals and taking orders. However, it is more efficient to call in and order/takeout, if you are really in a rush. I find that their kitchen staff is significantly faster than their sushi chefs, so the wait is a little bit longer for sushi. There are always plenty of open tables and several waiters walking around to assist you. The ambience is super casual; somewhere in between a fast food place and sit-in restaurant. I always order the spicy salmon don/bowl, which is similar to a poke-bowl, but with prearranged toppings. I also enjoy that they give you extra sauces free of charge! Bento has definitely become a Gainesville staple, but there are other options nearby!"
8/8/2017,5,"Bento is the kind of place that gives you all the feels when you come back to Gainesville. I've always been a big fan of bento - reasonably priced, quick service, and good sushi. I personally love to get the spicy don tuna bowl. But also highly enjoy their spicy cream chicken and red dragon roll. Plus if you check in on Facebook you get $1 off your order!"
6/29/2018,4,"I went to UF a few years back and still have friends who live here for work. So I occasionally come to visit, but every time I do, I always make sure to stop by bento! First, let's talk about parking. Their parking lot is ALWAYS busy. So getting ideal parking spaces are hard, especially on the weekend. Once you walk in, you'll usually see a line, but it goes by pretty quick. They have a two sided menu. One side for kitchen food, the other side is more like sushi/poke bowls. Every time I come here, I order Pork Katsu Curry bowl. Hands down, best katsu curry I ever had!! I always get red because it's spicy and I love spicy. I honestly don't think it's spicy at all, but everyone intakes are different. The katsu has a lot of flavor and very crispy!! Add the red curry with it and BAM, amazing. It has never failed me. So it's definitely a must try!!"
6/9/2019,3,"Bento is my go to Thai food in Gainesville. I usually stick to their creamy curry chicken bowl, with extra chicken (since it's a bit bowl of rice and 8pieces of chicken). The food is flavorful and consistent. Price is decent. Although it's mostly carbs on the majority of their meals. Restaurant is always clean and the food usually comes out relatively quick, especially since it's always busy. Staff is friendly."
7/25/2019,5,A haiku about the archer bentos amazing customer service:The new cashier guyrecommended bobba tea He deserves a raise
11/8/2019,5,"Bento is a busy restaurant and usually when it comes to take out or delivery a lot of mistakes are made, with that said, today I came in for a pick up I placed with Uber Eats, I was greeted my a young man named Dimitrius. Wow an expectional example of perfect and friendly customer service. In the past 4 years we have lived in Gainesville I have not ever felt as welcomed and pleasantly greeted as I was by Dimitrius. I told him it was very important I have chopstick enough for our family on the order we placed. He double checked the order before I got it and made sure I had enough, Bento ALWAYS forgets to provide chopsticks on delivery and pick ups.I was very impressed and hope going forward in the future they find more employees like him.Oh yes the food was great as always."
12/12/2020,5,They're always very busy in the evening and have a bit of a wait but it's because they're so good and they're poke bowls are the best! Love Bento!
11/15/2019,3,"My family and I have been eating at Bentos since there was only the Newberry road location, so we have a long history with them.  Initially Bentos was awesome with great food, environment and customer service.  We didn't mind spending our money at Bentos because it was just that good to us.  LATELY, our last 6 visits have not been good and weve been to both locations.   We attempted to try the new location but after waiting in the phone for over 20 minutes and being told it would be an hour wait, we decided not to try the downtown location.  For some unknown reason you have to request wasabi and ginger with your order.  I requested it 4 times, was told it was in my order, only to get home and find it wasn't. We just threw the food away. I'm not sure what's going on with Bentos but we are going to try other places from now on."
9/27/2017,5,"I just read some other Yelpers reviews and I don't know what got their panties in a twist because this place is phenomenal and has been for years. I have been eating at Bento since 2007 and it was solid then and it is solid now. All you need as proof of this is to drive by on a Friday night and see the line backed up into the dining room. The food is fresh, fast, and savory.I order the Spicy Cream Chicken with noodles and it comes with green beans. I like to refer to this chicken as ""donut chicken"" because the fried exterior is sweet with the perfect amount of crunch and the sauce gives it just the right amount of spice and tang. I feel guilty eating it because I know it is loaded with fat and they give you such a nice portion but it is my special treat when I go to Gainesville for games. In fact, it is our Friday night routine. My husband and I drive to Gville after work and get to Bento before we even check into our hotel room. We are even willing to stand in the aforementioned line for upwards of 30 minutes to get a bite of some Spicy Cream chicken. I love the décor. It is very lively, colorful, and modern. They have a large dining room at their Archer location and they also have the Coke Freestyle (always a hit). They offer sushi and milk tea but I don't ever order these options so I cannot comment on them. It is a hit with students and alumni alike. I recommend it to everyone! Go there, you'll like it."
8/27/2019,3,"Usually my go-to however, I waited an unusually long time for a small poke bowl with 3 toppings while the rest of my family got their orders quickly. The milk tea is horrible. Food was loved by everyone but me. They were stingy with avocado portions and for only having 3 toppings total I would've appreciated a good amount of avocado but they put a crack ton of furikake instead I guess. Also they were out of cucumber, and we came as soon as they opened. TLDR: Typically good food with bad milk tea and inconsistent service/quality"
1/15/2018,5,"One of my favorite Asian cuisine restaurants! I don't live in Gainesville, but almost every time I'm in Gainesville i have to eat at Bento. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get a noodle bowl, such as creamy chicken or pad Thai. They have a large variety of rice/noodle bowls and you get choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.). Last night I got chicken pad Thai and it did not disappoint. The sushi is very good as well. They have a large variety of classic and specialty rolls. The bento box is the best deal, you get 16 pieces for about $10, but you can only choose from the classic rolls. I also like how they have option of ordering half rolls on most or their rolls....so you can mix and match if you want some variety. Not too expensive either, will be $12-$14 if you get a fountain drink with your meal. They also have boba tea!!"
10/20/2018,4,"So I'm a sucker for a variety of tastes.  Was visiting my son at UF and he suggested BC for lunch.  I and the Pad Thai and a roll.  Let me say it was not great but OK.  I think food wise it is a three star, however concept wise it is four star and I was enjoying the company and place.  Prices were very fare and I would certainly return."
9/16/2016,4,"Made a quick stop here while on the road last weekend. Considering it was a Friday evening and there was a decent line, they were able to get people's orders efficiently. I ordered the orange chicken with noodles and a mango green tea while my wife ordered Thai pineapple shrimp rice bowl and a taro milk tea. I know my choice wasn't very adventurous but it was delicious. The chicken was more meat than breaded/fried bits which I greatly appreciated. The noodles were noodles, but there were a lot of them. I'm a sucker for mango so I loved the tea. My wife loved the pineapple shrimp. There weren't many pieces of pineapple but at least the flavor was there. She also had a lot of rice. The milk tea was delicious. Overall, my first trip to Bento was enjoyable and tasty. I'd recommend it."
11/17/2018,4,"This is the only place I can count on to give me a really good poke bowl. Every time I go it is perfect and their fish is high quality. I also enjoy their miso soup but sometimes it does not come out as hot as I would like it. Lately their service has been slow and they choose to only use one register rather than two, but I always leave happy because the food is worth the wait."
2/15/2018,4,"Always love coming to Bento Cafe. My favorite here is the Bento Box with General Tso's chicken. The variety of ginger salad, protein, rice, green beans and lo mein is well worth the price. You'll leave satisfied and without hurting your wallet so much. Great spot to step in for lunch or a night out for dinner. The dragon roll is also great. Never disappoints."
12/17/2018,4,"This is not my first nor my last time coming to Bento. I love their noodle bowls, edamame, and find the portion size just right. I see that they've changed their menu since I moved out of town, but no changes that negatively impact my experience. I like the build your own poké bowl option and the noodle bowls never disappoint for a fast Asian food option."
9/12/2018,4,"Not the biggest fan of their food, but their sushi is reasonably priced and pretty decent! It is a fast-food version of Asian food, so don't expect much quality from this place. It's a great spot for students who are on a budget and want some Asian food."
3/17/2016,4,"I have been coming to Bento for many years now. I left Gainesville back in 2010, but whenever I am in town I try to stop by Bento. I have always loved their sushi and their Bento boxes. My favorite roll is the Japanese Bagel. Unlike most sushi place's JB roll, I'm pretty sure they use smoked salmon and not plain raw salmon. I'm obsessed! The only issue I have with Bento is that there is always a super long wait. This most recent visit I waited over half an hour for 2 boba teas and 4 rolls. No idea why it takes so long. Maybe they are short staffed?"
12/29/2014,4,"I'd call this place ""fast food sushi"". It's good for what it is! We were in town for a couple hours and were in the mood for something fast and sushi related. BINGO Bento! I had a National Champ roll which consisted of a Mexican roll with a baked spicy mayo scallop mix on top. It was pretty good. My favorite part was the Honeydew smoothie with Mango jellies! It was delicious! This restaurant is average price and provides a pretty good bang for your buck. There's free parking in the parking lot at the front. The bathrooms are one stall each gender. You place your order at the front of the restaurant and receive a number where someone then delivers the food to you when it's ready. It's definitely worth checking out!"
1/8/2020,4,"I'm surprised this place has such low stars?  Altho to be fair we ordered delivery from Bento Asian Sushi Kitchen for the first time over the summer and were not impressed; because we did not order their specialty/ what they are known for but rather what we were craving at the moment. They do have a large selection to include multiple Asian cousins (Thai wasn't our favorite here). About 3 months ago I realized that a ton of Sushi places in the area focus on sushi rolls (which we have stopped eating for a long time as we developed a favoring of Sashimi and Omakase). For this reason I started to crave rolls and decided to try bento's rolls since they forgot to include our Fuji and Miami rolls (from our first order) so we never got to try their rolls. We got the Fuji, Miami, Spicy Mexican, Volcano and Caliente initially. Since then I have order the Volcano and Caliente rolls at least twice a week and they are truly heavenly. So, this is one of those places where you have to find your items (ours ended up to be their specialty rolls) since they have such a large variety of food!  My advice is take a chance as I'm so glad we didn't let our first experience turn us away for good!"
3/21/2019,1,"Found this stuck in the rice of my chicken tonkatsut bowl. Not knowing what it is, look a bit scary in real life. Got a stomachache  afterward. This place use to be good but definitely not anymore. The chicken taste old and rubbery"
1/13/2019,4,"God bless Bento.They offer entry-level pan-Asian cuisine that is affordable and accessible, without making you feel like you just ate fast food. Once you can make your way through the omnipresent atrocious lines at literally every hour of the day, the service is quick and professional. You order at the counter and then they offer a hybrid table service. No need to clean up after yourself, folks!I'm super predictable here - I always get the garlic and broccoli bento box with chicken. My partner is a much more adventurous human being and mixes it up with poke bowls and sushi. He's always pleased and comments on how fresh it tastes, which is great because we come from Fort Lauderdale where you sometimes have to wait for your fish to be caught at dinner. Back to the wait. This place is so insanely busy that sometimes we skip it because we just CANNOT spiritually handle standing in line for that long. They have got to open up more registers when the line snakes and triples around the lobby area. Come on, guys.Hopefully, their opening up the third location under the Standard by campus will help alleviate some of the wait times and we can come back more often."
4/8/2019,4,"I love this place and get takeout from here pretty much every week now. I wrote a prior review when they weren't doing as well and they really have made it better. The only complaint I have is still attached below.The take out process is terrible. You can't order online and they phone only has one line, so you can try for half an hour without ever getting through to actually place an order sometimes.Otherwise this place is one of my favorites, they are always fast dining in and once you place a takeout order they get it done quick. The staff is always friendly and I have never waited more than 30 seconds to be greeted by someone at the Togo counter. They deserve the credit for really improving the last few months. Come and try it out, it's worth it!"
7/19/2018,3,"Quick spot to come pick up asian type food. They have sushi rolls, bento boxes, and wok/grilled options. I think the pricing is pretty good and it's a decent place to stop by if you're looking for a quick meal."
9/14/2019,1,"When I visited Bento, every surface I touched was sticky. I was quite appalled by the lack of non sticky surfaces. I ended up just asking for my sushi to go because I was not okay with the level of stick up in there. I asked for the manager to let her know that maybe they should clean differently because of how STICKY it was, and she was like ""I'm sorry"" and all that but the whole time she was eating noodles while talking and I couldn't even finish the conversation I just left. I believe she said her name was Katy Lynn???"
6/5/2019,4,"I love Bento! I recently went with some friends to the Bento location on Archer Road and it just makes me love Bento more and more. I don't think you can ever get too much Bento! Bento on Archer Road is in the same plaza as Chipotle, Vale Food Co, and Relish. This is awesome because all of these places are semi-local. Why I say semi-local is Bento and Relish started in Gainesville but have now expanded to other cities in Florida and Vale started in Tally but quickly made Gainesville their home after getting started. During my meal at Bento I got some of my favorites like Pow Pow Chicken (Spicy cream chicken) and I got some sushi rolls as well. They were all amazing and I loved them. Reason for not 5 stars. The guy who took our order was just not nice. I think he was having a bad day, but un the end you should still be nice about it. He was just rude so it took away from the service I normally get here. I will for sure be back!"
12/26/2017,1,"It has been a very long year without Bento, and I was pumped to be back in town and have my usual spicy beef bulgogi rice bowl. For reference, I was here once a week when I used to live in Gainesville (14+ years of loyalty, folks!)I had heard complaints about how this Bento must have changed management or cooks since the food wasn't as good anymore, but I chose to come back anyways and see for myself. My bulgogi bowl was totally different - it had broccoli instead of scallions, the meat was half fat, and it was SO salty. Also, they only have plastic utensils now and I thought it was weird the waitress didn't bring utensils or napkins to the table with our food which used to be the norm.I don't think I'll be back, and I'd go as far as to warn others not to come or to maybe try the newberry location instead."
10/21/2015,4,"An Asian QSR? Yes, please!I didn't know such a thing existed but I'm walking on air. Going in blindly it can initially be confusing. Where to go---what to do? Not to fear as the cashier explains everything to you and it's rather simple. Pick one from wok, bento, sushi or soup bowl then your protein. Place your order, pay and they bring your meal to your table. I had the ginger scallion chicken bento and it was plentiful. It's all reasonably priced and you get a full meal. As with fast food restaurants, their tables are not cleaned between customers. Be aware.The highlight was receiving a coupon at check out for $1 off My Mochi next door."
1/31/2016,4,"Simply put, I liked it.I liked the sushi.  I liked my daughter General Tso's.I liked the smaller portions.I liked the people taking the orders; friendly, quick and helpful.I liked the speed of service;  everything came within ten minutes.I liked the interior of the seating area; spacious, well lit, nice.I will definitely return and hope to see one closer to where I live."
1/2/2020,2,"Every bento restaurant in Gainesville smells like feet and or baby poop....I have to eat outside whenever we go there. The food is okay, nothing to go crazy over and the boba tea is also not the best."
9/20/2019,1,Expect to wait for some mediocre overpriced food. $2.50 for a few ounces of miso soup and more than a tablespoon of sauce is an extra charge
12/28/2017,1,"I used to love Bento.  I've been going for years however my last visit killed me.1.  Parking sucks. Which I have been okay with up until my last visit when I twisted my ankle in a very poorly lit parking lot. 2.  New shortened menu.  Took a lot of options off.3.  Soup bowls were dirty when they arrived. 4.  Sushi fell apart, wasn't wrapped correctly. 5.  Taste was off. 6.  Miso soup was cold.7.  Soda machine broke down and I didn't get a drink my entire meal NOR a refund Kills me as it's my go to place when we visit Gainesville."
10/23/2018,5,"One of my favorite casual Asian food place. The line is always long during rush hour so I usually call in my order since I know what I want. Good for both take out and dine in. They are always having something new and exciting coming out too. Beef bulgogi is my bento box  go to. Crunch rolls  with Japanese mayo is also good. If you want something really healthy try poke bowls with lettuce base. I think their milk tea is a little to sweet, but green tea with raspberry is just perfect ."
2/7/2021,3,"My opinion on Bento is definitely split. I really enjoyed this place in undergrad before but recently the sushi rolls I've gotten with my usual order of the sushi combo box have really been lacking. The rolls recently are really small and poorly rolled. I am not sure if its because of a new sushi chef or what but it's really disappointing. Along with the combo box, I usually get the Boba tea, which is always great. The teriyaki bowl is also very good. The customer service is usually good but recently the wait times have also been a bit ridiculous. The last time I ordered, I ordered online and was given a 30min wait time when the order was placed. This was followed up with a phone call about my allergy preference I included on the order. After 25min we drove to Bento (7min drive) and ended up waiting another 30-40mins. I guess they were pretty backed up but a notice or a longer expected wait time would be a lot more convenient and safe than having customers stand and wait inside for 30-40mins."
2/19/2021,1,"First of all it took 45min for my food to get done. Secondly, I got my sushi and it literally was thrown around everywhere. I went to bite in it and my mouth was on fire because of how my sushi was thrown in, the wasabi had gotten all over the sushi so I couldn't even eat it. Never again."
8/16/2019,5,"The food here is always amazing. Bento is by far the best sushi in Gainesville. There is usually a bit of a wait, but it's worth it because the food is such high quality and always done to perfection."
8/16/2015,3,"I've been a regular at Bento since undergrad-- every time we had events in Gainesville, it would be the number one place where we would stop by. My all time favorite fish is the Spicy Creamy chicken/shrimp. It has a sauce similar to Bang Bang Shrimp, but I like theirs much better. I usually get it over noodles or rice because I'm not a big fan of their bento boxes-- maybe due to the lack of flavor of the sides.It's a pretty cheap place to get sushi. I like their the create-a-don because you can pick 3 types of meat on top of rice, avocado, cucumber, and seaweed. It's pretty tasty and fills you up. It gives you the bang for your buck if you're craving sashimi (rather than paying $5 for three pieces of meat). They also have milk teas and boba smoothies, but it needs improvement. The drinks are overly sweet and you can just taste the powder-- pretty nasty really, but I guess it can fool people who haven't tasted quality boba teas."
9/11/2013,4,"Having gone to school at UF, I know the good spots to eat while keeping the wallet happy.  Bento Cafe has always been a staple for me, even now, when I go up to Gainesville for work purposes.  There is plenty of seating and it's the type of restaurant where you order, pay for your order, and a runner brings you your food.  The soda machine is self serve also.When you're done, you can leave your empty plates/bowls on the table and the runners will carry them for cleaning.Bento Cafe serves a mix of sushi, Asian dishes, and Asian fusion dishes."
8/4/2015,4,"Food: Chicken udon stirfry -good size and flavor. Added a combo to add a soda and edamame and also got the ginger salad which was a good size salad with flavorful dressingKids chicken katsu nuggets - this was good with plenty of nuggets cooked perfectly although the katsu sauce was not authentic. It was light brown and weird and my daughter would not eat it. Environment:Sleek, clean, modernService:Friendly and attentiveDefinitely would return when in town."
1/9/2021,1,Terrible for DoorDashers. If you are a dasher PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST! Long waits that take up entire dash.
11/19/2018,4,"This is pretty good Asian food. It's not as good as pei wei because they don't add many veggies and they are a little heavy on the sauce. Overall, the tofu is really delicious and it's a great dining atmosphere. Would recommend."
10/25/2017,4,"Bento is the place to go when you want fast, affordable Asian food. At least once a week, my roommates and I end up here because this is literally the only place in Gainesville where our food is on the table sometimes before we even sit down! And when you're hangry, that is very. Important. Since Bento is by a lot of universities across Florida, I've actually had the opportunity to try the majority of their menu and have compiled a list of items that you can't go wrong with! If it's your first time there, I highly recommend the fried krab wontons, pineapple thai fried rice, red curry, Korean, or katsu entrees! Out of their bubble teas, I'm not really a huge fan of their milk teas since they are too heavy for me. I always end up getting a green tea or blended ice. My two regulars are either the passionfruit green tea with lychee jelly or the mango blended ice with strawberry popping boba. Oh, and keep an eye out for their monthly specials! One of their fall specials is pumpkin wontons, and my roommates and I love them so much. Definitely worth trying!"
10/15/2016,2,"Kind of feel cheated a little. So you pay 13.25 for a bento box with extra meat. The quality is not really there at all. The dessert is some fried wonton skin with evaporated milk.The salad is an odd ginger salad.The string beans I am not sure are fresh or honestly they feel really squishy.Lo mein is an easy cheat to appease customers.I am also not sure the bulgogi is real korean food, but hey that's what you get for going to a place that has a Japanese originating word. I understand that bento inherently has smaller portions that culminate to a large meal but honestly the quantity and quality don't match with the price. The cashier was nice but the person who gave me my food was rather curt.I know I sound critical but honestly this place is fine if you don't care about the quality then go for it. The service is ok and the food will suffice. I would have given this a three star but that price doesn't qualify this place for fairness. Maybe go next door to chipotle, sorry but at 9 bucks or so you get extra meat and all of the rest that comes with a rice bowl or burrito. Not advertising Chip but seriously think about it.I would not recommend this place."
8/5/2015,4,"I would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends and family. I really liked the food here. I had the yellowtail sashimi and the ginger scallion chicken rice bowl.  It was delicious the portions are quite big, my boyfriend and I shared it since we weren't too hungry. The sashimi I order was fresh and big, the pieces are bigger than some of the places around town. I'm considering coming back for lunch tomorrow.  The service was quick, our food came out wishing 10min of ordering. The atmosphere was good, very nice decor and relatively clean.  I thought the ordering process was a bit confusing for first time visitors. There was no sign that say ""grab menu here"", I just grabbed the menu because other customers did that. The stirfry menu was a little bit confusing too, but the line was long so I had time to figure out."
5/7/2018,4,I come here about as much as I can. I've tried pretty much everything on their menu including sushi. For the price that they are charging they give you so much food and the quality is great. I really love having Bento here as fast food options
3/31/2020,4,"this bento has great food if that's all you're looking for in a restaurant. on the other hand the staff was not friendly or welcoming and made me feel like a burden for even coming in. i've learned to just call in an order so i don't have to wait 45min in the store. like i said, the food is good but not much else really made this restaurant stand out for me. the taro boba is pretty good too!"
12/7/2019,5,"Madison ( manager ) & staff were super nice & food was delicious! Will def return! Highly recommend the ""Caliente roll"" Yum!"
8/16/2019,4,"If there's one thing I've learned about the Gainesville food scene over the past few weeks, it's that Gainesville has tons of fast casual restaurants (think Chipotle except they don't assemble your bowl in front of you, it takes them 10 minutes to make and assemble in the back). Bento is a great example of a fast casual sushi place with other assorted Asian offerings. I ordered the pad thai, which had a surprisingly large serving (lasted me 2.5 meals), and the thai tea boba, both of which I enjoyed. The pad thai was not the best I ever had, but it was decent, and for the speed with which it was prepared, I can't complain. One note on the sushi - most of their rolls have cream cheese, so if you're dairy-free, this may not be a good option. Would definitely return when craving a quick Asian dish - better than Chinese takeout for sure!"
8/18/2017,4,"Bento is a staple in Gainesville! Really appeals to the college student. It's fast and affordable asian food. Sounds a lot like take out but its a step above that, which makes it an appealing place! If you are stopping by Gainesville and craving asian food, this is a great and quick place to pick something up and has a broad selection of sushi and meats that will satisfy any craving!This location is huge, there is a lot of seating and service is pretty quick. My go-to dishes are the spicy cream chicken rice bowl and the surf and turf don. The spicy cream chicken rice bowl is pretty heavy, I never finish it in one sitting, but it's something I crave if I have been away from Gainesville for long. The surf and turf don is nice and light, has a mix of raw tuna (or can be changed for salmon) and chicken katsu, with rice, avocados and wakame. This is another dish that I crave as I love the textures between the raw fish and the fried chicken. They also sell teas/milk teas with boba, but it falls short and there are way better options in Gainesville. I would save your money and not order a tea drink here as their boba is pretty rough and hard. Overall, if you're craving asian food but don't feel greasy enough for take out, bento is a great option. There is huge seating area and it's a frequent place for large groups to meet up and have a meal. I would definitely recommend!"
10/5/2015,5,"Best restaurant ever, especially their sushi. I got the almond joy boba tea with tapioca pearls. Seriously tastes like an almond joy. I got the National Champ roll. Cream cheese, avocado and crab filled with crab scallop spicy mayo mix on top. I also got the Crunch roll. Lightly fried on the outside with tuna, crab, cream cheese and cucumber inside. Highly recommend"
10/30/2020,3,"It wasn't bad but Bento quality has definitely went down, my Krab Wontons were so greasy I took a bite and grease got all over my hands. The sushi was mediocre but my kids Katsu bento box was good. Overall not impressed like I use to be ‍"
12/1/2019,2,"I travel for work so when I am in town. Bentos is definitely the place I head to for a quick bite to eat. Tonight they seemed pretty busy/packed. There were about 6 people ahead of me. Ordered the spicy tuna roll and thr shrimp tempura  udon noodle soup. Had to be at work within an hour. Plenty of time. Received my spicy tuna roll within 15 mins. Started noticing other customers that had ordered after me receive their entrees. I decided to check in with the staff 35 minutes after I placed my order. Asked to put my order for here to go instead. For some reason my order got missed and other orders after mine were being served. Went to cancel my order, before they did so I could see one of the staff frantically looking for my order along the take out orders. They happened to find it tucked away..... Good food, however. Hopefully this isn't a frequent mishap for them."
2/2/2015,3,"Went for lunch with co-workers. Very friendly and informative cashier. Ordered the spicy cream chicken bento box. Everything was good, I couldn't eat it all. Chicken was crispy & hot, not too much spice. Comes with rice, noodles, friend green beans and salad."
8/16/2018,5,"I like this place, food, quality, service and price are great. Beautiful and clean restaurant. I'll be back for sure"
11/19/2016,3,"Expensive, cafeteria style sushi.  The food was okay, very much like cafeteria food, even though it was sushi.  About $10 per meal.  Not sure how poor college students afford it."
8/13/2019,2,"The wait here is ridiculous for such small portions of food to be prepared. Ordered a to go poke bowl on a Tuesday night and it took 25 minutes to get it. My gosh, you can steak prepared faster at a steakhouse. Plus the staff there is very unaware of what quality customer service is. For the money and time you're truly better off going somewhere else."
7/6/2019,4,Tasty and fresh! Would definitely go back. Lots to order on the menu and service was fast. Place was clean too. Kudos!
9/10/2017,3,"Had dinner here. The line was pretty crazy, we waited about 20 minutes however the employees did warn everyone in line how long the wait would be. I ordered the noodle bowl with orange chicken. We received our food rather quickly even with everyone that was waiting. The noodles were good the orange chicken was not my favorite. It also didn't seem like it had just been cooked. It seems like it had been sitting there for a while before they served it."
5/22/2018,5,I love this place. My favourite restaurant which serves the best Pad Thai in Gainesville. Have tried almost everything here and never got dissappointed. Great ambiance and has a great sushi kitchen. Excellent menu options at an affordable price.
10/9/2016,3,"Only reason I wouldnt rate them higher is their lack of gluten free options. Typically a place like this will offer a rice noodle, but there werr only two options. The food wasnt bad, but it wasnt great.I would have ordered the sushi but it was off to the side and did notice until after I had placed my order. Ended up with the curry and the sweet and sour, both were swimming in the sause and still lacked a little flavor. My friends partook in what appeared to be the more popular choices, which were ordered by several other patrons around us, and they loved and devoured it."
12/26/2016,4,"The students of UF are very lucky to have a place like Bento. Hailing from Miami as a gator alum, I was not the biggest sushi fan as a young student. However, that all changed when I met my wife and sushi was introduced as a regular part of my diet.Bento offers very reasonably priced food including rolls, bowls and hot Asian fusion items. After the 5 hour commute from Miami we pulled off at the Bento on Archer. We arrived around 3:00 PM and the place surprisingly had a decent crowd. I opted for a create-your-own bowl and packed it with fresh tuna, brown rice, avocados, carrots, scallions, and topped with eel sauce. I was genuinely surprised how fresh the tuna was. The bowl itself was delicious and filling. I am very jealous that there's not a Bento in Miami although I did hear there was one that opened up near Ft. Lauderdale. The UF students don't know how good they have it with Bento in Gainesville. My wife, a Tulane alum was absolutely obsessed. She couldn't get enough of Bento and I'm sure it will be a regular stop on all future Gainesville trips."
5/15/2015,4,"Stopped by Bento cafe for late lunch. For some reason the line was long. I got the chirasa, we had to wait a while to get the food, but once it came it wasn't bad.It is what it is, which is fast food sushi. It straddles that line between truck stop sushi and a dedicated Japanese restaurant.Given my preference, I'd stop at a Japanese restaurant, but when I would need fast sushi or fast Japanese food, Benito cafe makes due."
9/23/2016,1,Place was busy on a Friday night. Noisy due to lack of acoustic damping. Too dimly lit. Food was ok but not great. Tried the Cantonese pork chops. Too much breading and there were at least 5 big pieces that were just clumps of breading. Worst of all was a piece of debris- hard plastic mixed into the lo mein which I had to spit out. Tried this place once and not coming back.
6/23/2009,4,"I always frequent this location every time I come to Gainesville, because it is so close to where I stay.  It is very convenient, relaxing, there is plenty of parking, and they are open late.  I love the Taiwanese fashion magazines that you can look at while waiting for your food to arrive, which does not take long BTW.  Plus, it is so much easier to park and now Mochi is next door and is addictive.  There are two things that I come here for:  Korean style noodle bowls and Taiwanese Beef Noodle SoupThis is the only place that I have found Taiwanese style beef noodle soup in Florida, or almost anywhere for that matter other than that one time I found it in Montreal.  It is loaded with five spice, delicious chewy noodles, slow cooked pieces of beef, and oh so spicy.  They call it Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup, but I know what it is _really_.Their noodles are so good!  They call them Korean Seasoned Noodles, and they are good with anything on them.  You can also change any of the stir-fry dishes, or bento boxes to a noodle bowl or rice bowl.  I recommend the Cantonese (sweet and salty) Pork Chop over noodles or the Beef Bulgogi Noodle Bowl. We were here last weekend and the bubble tea tasted crazy, like it was fermented or had some sort of chemical in it.  I noticed that other patrons were making funny faces when they were drinking it as well.  I am going to actually skip the tea at this location next time and get it from Lollicup, where they don't play around and make some damn good tea.If I do get sushi here, I get the National Champ Roll.  Their sushi is not so great, and the nori is often so chewy that you cannot choke it down.  So, I only get it here if I have a huge sushi craving that cannot be contained to the point where I am willing to chew some nori for five minutes to taste the food.  The Newberry Road location is notorious for the chewy nori, but the Archer Road location sometimes makes it edible.  Everyone says that this place is cheap, but everytime I come here it is always at least $30.00 for two people with two meals and two bubble teas."
7/20/2020,1,"Every time I come to pick up or eat in (pre-COVID) I get the worst costumer service. When I'm eating in, no one is friendly while I'm placing my order. When I order out, they ALWAYS can't find my order, even when I come ten minutes after my pickup time. And then after that, they forget a side or utensils. So frustrating."
6/10/2019,4,"I was a regular here all through my college years and I can firmly say that it hasn't changed at all! I love this place! You can never go wrong with the sriracha garlic udon noodle bowl or even my other personal favorite, the curry katsu chicken rice bowl! Additionally, the sushi here is always made fresh to order and the staff is​ upbeat and friendly! During busy hours, such as dinner, I'd recommend just calling in an order for pickup on your way there to avoid waiting in that long line because it can end up taking some time. Overall I would always recommend this spot to any friends along with the more recent Davie, FL location for anyone visiting or living in South Florida!"
2/15/2017,4,"Ok so I m split.  Bento Blue y'all kinda drop the ball 3/5 stars bento red! Y'all rock 5:5 stars Blue- same great quality food, service staff however is terrible, (always appear to hate their job, very short with customers and to busy socializing than hospitalityRed- great quality food, clean, fun environment, awesome staff. Keep up the work guys."
7/11/2020,1,"Every bite, this meal became more disappointing. This was the most expensive bowl of chewy chicken and mushy rice I have ever had. Unfortunately, the soggy green beans were the best part."
1/24/2017,2,"This place is an Asian fast food sort of place where you stand in line to order, go to the soda machine to refill your Coke and then sit wherever there's an empty table.However, both times I've been in here, I have loved the atmosphere (very college-y) but was disappointed with the food. I've tried their sushi and one of their noodle bowls and both were not very enjoyable.Service was good both times. Both the cashier and the server were helpful.The food looks much better than it actually tastes. Hopefully they work on that part more because I do enjoy their atmosphere and the food in theory has potential to be really good."
1/13/2017,4,"Out of all the sushi places in Gainesville this is one of the best ones! If you're looking for quick sushi to dine in, it's antastic! I always get the sushi combo box. It comes with an 8 piece California roll and you pick 2 more 4 piece rolls for a total of 16 rolls for $10! I love the value re and spicy salmon. Always fresh and always delicious! Sometimes the extra rolls are a little bit small depending on which ones you choose, but overall you can beat $10! Also comes with Wakame salad and a side dish of either vinegar cabbage or spiced cucumber depending on the chef. LOVE bento!!!!"
3/31/2019,4,"Bento is the easy Sunday night option. Poke bowl for me and spicy cream shrimp udon bowl for hubs. Lots of options, decent prices. This isn't cutting edge innovative food but it's a cheap staple and a decent option for dinner"
4/25/2014,3,"Bento Red (Archer Road location as opposed to the original ""blue"" location on Newberry Road) is pretty cool: Asian fusion cuisine in a fun, modern, dimly-lit and red-hued atmosphere. They offer sushi and a staggering array of pan-asian bento boxes and noodle bowls. I think now they also at Bento offer the Asian sandwich options of their Hiro sandwich shop next door, too. And bobo teas--they also have bobo teas! So very cool concept--indeed, one that now has locations in Orlando and Jacksonville and spawned several other Asian restaurants in the same family. There's a lot--too much--that one can say of Bento, so here's the good and the bad as short and sweet as I can muster:The good:--It's fun, it really is. --The staff are unfailingly nice and very prompt despite an often-high customer volume. I won't call it fast food, but it normally is pretty speedy.--The selection is pretty good: nothing too exotic nor probably that authentic, but a good selection of pan-asian but Americanized items. --Some dishes are quite good: the spicy cream sauce dish and the katsu, in example. --The bento box concept is great. As are the noodles and green beans that always come with the bentos as signature sides.The bad:--The bento box sides, I don't know when they make these, but sometimes super-fresh and other times, actually stale-tasting or off. I expect given the volume they go through, the noodles are made in huge vats and some unlucky someone gets the ones from the bottom sooner or later.--The sushi greatly varies in quality--both of fish it seems and certainly of the chef's skills. There are two chefs--the serious-look Asian one and the tall, really cute, white dude--who are great, but some of the others, not so much. --Several friends claim they got sick after having Bento. I've not had that experience, knock on wood, and I hate to ever mention hearsay in a review, but I've heard it several times and I have had sushi and noodles before both that I felt were . . . suspect. Fish that tasted off. But then again, sometimes I've had great sushi at Bento. You just never know.Folks, Bento is what it is. It's great we have something like this and I know they're sincere in their efforts. It's kinda-fast and it's high-volume and college-oriented. It's possible to get very good food here . . . and also possible to get something (like those noodles) from the bottom of the proverbial barrel. I would try to hit them on peak hours but not near the end of a busy night nor in the middle of the afternoon."
4/21/2017,4,"This was a quick stop made during finals week. I ordered the Bento Box with Beef Bulgogi. It was good. The salad was wilted and the dressing was overly sour. The green beans were good, the noodles dry, but the beef over the rice was delicious. It was marinated just right. I think next time I will just order the rice bowl with bulgogi. The prices are kind of high for the amount of food that you receive, but overall I was fairly satisfied."
10/26/2014,5,"There isn't a Bento Cafe in Tampa so whenever I'm in Orlando, Jax, or Gainesville, Bentos is a necessary stop. A wide variety of options, the menu is packed with affordable and well proportioned cuisine. My all time favorite is the spicy cream sauce with shrimp or chicken~ whatever I'm feeling at the moment. I've also tried the katsu, teriyaki chicken, and bulgogi; all very delicious items. Spicy cream sh/ch definitely hits the spot every once in a while so I'll admit it doesn't seem like the healthiest choice (there are plenty of healthy alternatives) but it's a popular choice!I've eaten at Bentos in both Orlando locations, Jacksonville, and Red Bento (as opposed to blue), all have great service and even better food."
7/5/2016,4,"Bentos is that perfect Asian mix that tries hard to provide authentic Chinese food while also catering to the Western style of Chinese food. I find it to be a comfort food and I was a frequent visitor back when I was a Gainesville resident. Whenever I get the chance to visit Gainesville again, Bentos always comes to mind.The Chicken curry Katsu and the spicy cream chicken are always my go tos. You'll want to get either the noodle bowl or rice bowl as both dishes can be quite saucy so a carb pretty much plays a critical role to balance out the flavors. A point to note is I have had the chicken come to me with a rubbery texture before in the curry katsu so be on the lookout for that!I've gotten the bento box before which comes with a dessert and vegetables all laid out in a cutesy box but in the end, if you're hungry, I recommend getting a rice/noodle bowl.I docked off a star only because the wait time can be a bit excessive. More than once, they've  brought out our food at different times to the point where the last person finally received their dish when half our party was done eating.One last thing, the Bentos fried rice is solid. So if you're feeling fried rice, this could be the spot for you."
6/13/2019,5,"My sushi was fresh and neatly rolled, not to mention, delicious! And the cashier and waiter were so nice!"
5/9/2016,2,"The last time I went to Bento's was in early 2008, at the Newberry Road location.  This was long before Yelp, but I remember the place being average.  This Bento's was not, for the reasons I will detail.    When we got there, there was no one at the register.   So, we used that time to figure out what we wanted.  There were several people behind the register, servers I suppose, interacting with the cooks.  I guess none of them noticed or cared to find out why there was no one at the registers.  FInally about five to seven minutes later two people showed up to man the registers, as there was a line forming behind the four of us.  So we placed our order, and seated ourselves. Almost immediately, my friend's tofu came out.  By itself.  Ten minutes later my other friend's chicken bowl came out.  twenty minutes after that, my unadon bowl came out, and ten minutes after THAT my girlfriend's crunch roll came out.  I have a problem with this for several reasons, the first being that you are supposed bring out all the meals at once.  The second is it shouldn't take forty plus minutes to make a sushi roll.  The only reason I could think that they did this was so everyone got their food piping hot. Now, everyone else's food looked pretty good, my friend said there was the perfect ratio of sauce to tofu to vegetables.  My other friend looked like his bowl was half chicken and half rice.  My girlfriends crunch roll was average size.  My unadon bowl was pathetic.  Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. But there were six tiny cuts of eel on a giant bowl of cold rice.  It was garnished with seaweed, avocado and cucumber, and the avocado and cucumber slices were thicker and bigger than the eel.  Also, when the server showed up with my eel bowl, she didn't offer me a fork like she did everyone else, I had to ask her for one and she never came back so I ended up hunting one down on my own. I think if I have to have asian fusion food in the future and i'm in Gainesville, I'm going to the other location, or Chopstix."
2/27/2016,5,"This place was excellent. My wife has been telling me about this place for years. Seeing how Asian cuisine is my favorite, I had to go.This place did not disappoint. For $9 you get an entire bento box, packed with all the goodies. My wife has spicy cream chicken and Mt. Fuji sushi roll and they were awesome! If you like a little spice, definitely get that chicken! The outside was the right amount of crispy and soft. Cooked to perfection.I had the Cajun chicken box (could you tell we like spicy?) and the fried pork dumpling. I really love dumplings so I was curious how these would turn out. The fried part was great, which is not a huge feat, but what set it apart is that it's packed with pork! Usually these things skimp on the stuffing but not this place!So excited this is coming to Tallahassee because I'll definitely become a regular at this place. If you're near here, stop by! You can get Chipotle any time :)"
5/30/2020,2,I like Bento as a whole but this particular location just isn't up to par in cleanliness. Before the pandemic whenever we went in there the tables and floor were always dirty and we often had to bus our own tables. We just did takeout with them for the first time since the pandemic and you'd think restaurants would be on high alert. However I still found 2 pieces of hair on my meal that didn't come from anyone in my household based on the length and color. Disappointing and gross.
1/20/2017,1,"I have had so many bad experiences here, I think I am done with them. It is a college town, so it stays busy. With dragonfly setting the standard, I would give this place a negative five. I have had good experiences at the Jax bento, so I believe it is this location. Very little flavor, dry, no sauces to add flavor, etc."
12/7/2011,4,"Why don't we have a Bento Cafe in Tampa?!?!  This place is awesome, great sushi and stir-fry at extremely reasonable prices.  My huband and I got two miso soups, a sashimi tuna bowl, and a sashimi tuna side dish for $16 (so cheap!).  My sister's teriyaki rice bowl and fountain drink were around $10.Great for the broke college student.  I am not a broke college student, but I sure do appreciate a cheap meal!  The quality of the food was quite good; I did have a bite or two of tuna that was a little chewy (probably cut too close to the tail).  But all in all the food was of good quality and the portions were generous.The parking lot was packed as most parking lots are packed on Archer road.  Will definitely go back next time I visit my sister in Gainesville!"
6/23/2012,4,"I'm from Atlanta, GA. Come down to G-ville alot for college extracurricular activities. Anyways, Atlanta needs one of these stores up here ASAP! There is a locally own restaurant up here with the same name, but it's a Taiwanese Cuisine (which is really good). People from Florida that come up here thinks it's apart of the same chain, but it's not. But for my review! The food is awesome. Creamy chicken rice/noodle with the fried green beans please. THE ENTREE I always get when I visit. I've had their Bento boxes as well and it's pretty tasty. Price is just right for the portion. I also see that they're a big supporter of UF, which is a great thing to know. They have a wide-selection of boba tea as well, but I've had better. Other than that, great franchise!"
1/1/2019,1,Ordered from here two times and different dishes but still no good. The food is chewy and always has a strange after taste. Very bland and not very fresh.
3/1/2020,5,Honestly a staple of Gainesville. I always stop and grab some to go whenever I visit because it's addicting especially their pao pao chicken!! It's affordable sushi but with quality taste. I've never been disappointed. Sometimes it can get crazy when it's dinner time or if it's game day but that's when you call ahead ;) you're missing out if you're in Gainesville and don't stop in for lunch or dinner #gogators
11/1/2016,4,"We stopped here on our way up to Atlanta for a quick bite. I love the theming, and the many options available. The food was really good-I love my pineapple shrimp noodle bowl. I think everyone loved their meals-and the portions were huge! The only downsides were the long line (but it was dinnertime on a Friday, and they kept it moving) and my taro milk tea was pretty gross. Other than that, seemed like a nice place. There was a small stage in the corner that I would guess is used for live performers sometimes."
8/2/2018,5,"My Asian go to spot! I love their tofu and the fact that I can get it in almost all their selections is awesome. The atmosphere is great for meeting friends to eat and hangout. It cracks me up that they always have some crazy cartoon show on one of their TVs. They always have a long line during lunch and dinner time so it is best to get there before the rush or wait a bit and go after. The service is hit and miss, sometimes it's awesome and other times it is so-so, but the food is always good! YUM-YUM!!"
1/23/2014,4,"Every time I pass through Gainesville, I'd try to pick up something from Bento. I wish we had one in the Tampa Bay area. The food here isn't extraordinary, but it's good for the price. My all time favorite from Bento is SPICY SALMON DOM. I like it because the portion is perfect for me (smaller portion than at  sushi restaurants and therefor cheaper) and it has everything I want in one dish: sushi rice, spicy salmon, seaweed salad and avocado.Just the other day on our way home from up north, my bf and I needed to pick up something real quick so we stopped by Bento. Good thing I called ahead to place the order because there were about 15 people in line. We got the Spicy Salmon Dom, Spicy Conch Roll, Stir Fry Udon and Milk Tea. As usual, I loved the Salmon Dom. First time trying the Stir Fry Udon and my bf really liked it. I did have a taste and I think I might order it next time. I was so-so with the Spicy Conch Roll and Milk Tea. The conch roll didn't have much of a taste and the milk tea was a bit bland.If you're not eating there, my advice is to place your order before coming in. Gainesville is a college town so this place can get very crowded. We were in and out within 10 min. I love that the menu is extensive."
4/28/2019,1,There was a piece of bone in my chicken. Very disappointed. I usually go here a lot but this bone was absolutely gross and hurt my tooth when i bit down on it
2/20/2018,1,Boba milk tea tasted like powdered chalk with some sugar. You can tell it's pre-made mix. It even curdles. Nasty stuff. Big let down compared to fresh flavors of lollicup.
7/22/2018,5,"If you want a quick bite of Pan-Asian/Asian American food with a modern/young atmosphere, then this is the place for you! The quantity is fair for the price. Even though I end up getting the spicy cream chicken rice bowl often; I would recommend any of the rice bowls noodle bowls, or bento box. If you are aiming to go somewhere strictly for sushi though, then I would recommend somewhere else. Bento's sushi is good, but there are better options out there. Haven't had any problems with the service here ever."
1/14/2014,2,"Bento Cafe is an Asian fusion restaurant that I found interesting. Slightly Americanized but still satisfying to the taste buds. I ran into some trouble with the sushi so I advise against that, but I did love the rice dishes they have, with the different noodle/rice/bento box options. There are too many good options to choose from. I've had the Cantonese Pork Chop (3.5), which was satisfying but at the same time seemed lacking... the sauce and the pork chop together was a little cliche. Maybe I'm jaded by fusion Asian food.. Bugolgi (3.5) is also not bad, although nothing special.I had to take off at least 2 stars for the 2 days I spent of my vacation curled up in ball in my friend's bed. Never ordering raw sushi here ever again..."
3/30/2018,5,Good food and good prices. Service can be really fast or really slow depending on what you order. Lines can be really long during prime hours. But you can always find a place to sit. Love the bulgogi beef bento box and spicy tuna/salmon don!
11/27/2018,3,"Either you come when the line is too long or none at all. So hope the odds are ever in your favor. Service is well organized so you'll get your food soon after ordering, that is, if you ever get to order anytime soon. Food is good. Sushi is ok. I'm a beast of habit so my go to is the Red Curry Katsu Chicken Bento box. Would rate 3.5 but yelp doesn't do halfsies."
9/29/2018,2,"The food is pretty decent here, but they jacked up prices on a lot of their food recently and portions went down so I don't really go anymore. I used to go once a week and now I never go. Sad to see these places cut corners and take a turn downhill."
2/2/2019,5,"On a visit to The University of Florida we happened to find this gem of an Asian food place near our hotel. I was not sure of what to do when I walked in and found people waiting in a line and others waiting and holding numbers. A polite young woman who works there guided me through the process. Grab a menu and get in line. Select your entree and there are great choices from Bento boxes, bowls and noodle bowls. I chose the shrimp tempura bento box and a bubble tea. Everything was delivered to our table. I was surprised at the nice portion of shrimp which tasted great. Everything was delicious! If my daughter gets that U of F acceptance we will be back often!"
2/27/2020,5,"Husband wanted something different while visiting Gainesville Fl...looked on google maps for restaurants and came across Bento and wow what an amazing surprise! The food was great, service was amazing, and the atmosphere was very inviting! The kids were happy as they could get Boba tea!"
4/25/2014,1,"Service only.. Still waiting for my food. The guy at the counter was super nice. I was going to tip.... But he shorted my change! I watched him put it in his pocket!  It was only a dollar... He was nice enough to give the cents back. He was so nice until that point (first time here. Traveling. Generally a 20% tipper). So be careful of the Asian guy w/ the guages. Would have said something at the time.. But there's a line out the door and he already opted to be a punk and shorted everyone else (I'm guessing tips in the jar are shared... ) after verifying w/ receipt as I wait I opted to let everyone know. Love yelp: no confrontation just reporting!!!!!UPDATE:: got my food (it's okay... Think chipotle of Asian food) but there was a hair in my salad! Why are these people wearing tank tops, no gloves, or hair nets. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years... Pretty sure they are supposed to be worn. Whatever. I don't live in this town I'll never be back. If you know what real Asian food is don't go here. If you want Asian fast food w/o a drive thru and possibly shorted on change and a little piece of hair in you food go here."
7/15/2013,3,Not too bad for fast food style ordering except it wasn't very fast. More cooked to order just like any other oriental restaurant. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.More next time
11/28/2020,2,The experience was not the best. The young lady taking in person orders was clearly not having a great day. She was annoyed by our questions in regards to the menu. She was also just staring at us while we made our decision as if we were inconveniencing her. No one else was in line waiting to order so I'm not sure why she was so annoyed. She was also annoyed because we did get a drink to go with our meal. They also up charge $5 if you want Fried Rice instead of white or brown rice for the rice bowl. That up charge is ridiculous and uncalled for. Not sure why they don't accept cash but again it's another thing that doesn't make sense. If the young lady fixes her attitude or actually enjoys her job then maybe the experience for the guest would be more enjoyable. Everything we watched her do while we waited for our food was with a face and attitude of being annoyed but the tasks she was being given.
9/9/2018,1,"Food had no taste. Pad Thai, very Americanized, so If that is the type of food you're looking for you might enjoy this. Seems like cheap-college food. Bubble tea was disgusting, worst we've ever had. Was excited to find a new go to take out place near us, but needless to say we won't be back. Don't waste your time. Find someplace authentic."
9/5/2018,4,"I love bento cafe. I have been here about 3 times now. I like their Green Curry and Sushi. I recommend their boba tea, it's a must try. Ambiance is good. Staff is friendly and polite."
5/7/2018,4,"This is a good place if your looking for a quick pan-asian meal. I wouldnt say the dishes are quite authentic, but they are better than your typical fast food asian place. The service is fast even thought the restaurnt is busy often. They offer many different rice and noodle bowls, as well as sushi, poke bowls, udon soups, ramens, and bentos. Bento also has a full bubble tea bar. It is a great place to hang out with friends or family, and it is also a decent price for what you get. With every meal you order, you get a coupon for $1 off Mochi, a frozen yogurt place in the same plaza."
6/11/2017,1,"I don't normally eat outside coz it's expensive, but last Friday night, my husband and I went to Bento Cafe the one at Archer branch to order a take out meal coz I was just so hungry and we were at the area. One of the  crew who took our order, even asked my husband and I if we're vegetarians, and we said yes. Ordered a tofu general tso first, but he said that it's not vegetarian coz of the sauce, so I changed it to sriracha garlic tofu and he confirmed that it's vegetarian. Fast forward, got home and I was happily eating my dinner when I suddenly saw some meat mixed with my tofu! The piece of meat is strategically hidden at the bottom of the tofu and rice! Huh! Clearly, this was intentional! Not a good prank at all! What if I was badly allergic? I never had issue like this before with bento cafe the one at newberry road! I'm really upset and not a happy customer at all!!! For a good customer like me, I deserve way much better than this! This is so disrespectful!"
6/10/2018,4,"Bamboo sushi is beyond expectations! Fresh, delicious and good price."
11/9/2019,3,"I'm always excited for Bento, I love the spicy cream rice bowl. Always so good. I went tonight around 10pm and was super excited that nobody was in there. I got my rice bowl and decided to add some sushi. After ten minutes the bowl was ready. I then had to wait 30 more minutes for the sushi. When I finally asked where it was, it looked like it was done for a while and they put it to the side and forgot about it. My rice bowl was room temp at best when I got home. I will probably stick with the Newberry location from now on."
6/21/2011,4,"First time for me since I was visiting a friend and I enjoyed it to the fullest their expanding and even getting a DJ which is pretty amazing too me ,It attracts the College kids from UF and is their base support of business and is very hectic during 6-7. Their staff is very helpful and friendly their manager Paul I think is chill guy and will help you with anything you need if he is around. I tried the special Hamachi ceviche which was requested by me since I didn't want tuna. That is why i remember the Paul guy so much. I ate their General Tao Chicken too, Holy crap it was steaming it looked and smelled good when they brought it to my table, i think the taste surprised me the most. It was sweet but perfect to my taste buds."
4/20/2017,4,Very good. Walkable from hotel. While that factored into my decision my meal got me to review. Very good for the price. A little slow but that was because of crowd. Popular joint. I had the sashimi. Though I've had better great for the price and the overall experience is worth you stopping in.
5/8/2018,1,This restaurant will NOT accommodate customer requests.  They will be dead all summer but can afford to deny request to sub rice paper instead of seaweed in sushi rolls in the sushi box.  They will do it for $1 upcharge on any other 8 pc roll but will NOT do it in the box even with the upcharge.By all means the 20 year old sushi manager tos her NO!
12/2/2012,4,"Looking for a place to eat in the middle-of-nowhere Florida that has a diverse Asian food menu?  Look no further. I call myself an Asian food snob.  I've lived throughout Asia, and call southern California home.  That said, I am really picky when it comes to things like sushi, boba, and Korean BBQ.  I was really happy when I tasted the food at Bento Cafe, though.I ordered a pretty diverse spread: various sushi rolls, some miso soup, chicken katsu curry, and a boba drink.  Odd to have so many types of Asian food under one roof, and I was pretty suspicious that the food would be bad because of it.  I was pretty wrong!The sushi rolls were enormous and stuffed with fillings. It wasn't mostly rice like a lot of places do.  The katsu curry was excellent - a huge portion, served over bok choy (I know, not traditional), but it tasted excellent. Looking around, most of the other dishes were like an Asian bistro's take on traditional dishes, all done really well.The boba was awesome - the tapioca pearls were perfectly done - not hard or too soft. There were a ton of flavors...even alcoholic ones!I came back here twice more during the week. This place definitely beats a lot of the ""big box restaurants"" endemic to middle America (like Applebees).  Frankly, I was surprised (and overjoyed) to find it in Gainesville.1 star off for really loud ambience, and relatively slow service - but this place is pretty busy all the time from the looks of it.  It also has a full bar, and is a great place to watch the college/pro ball games!"
9/27/2019,1,"Spent an hour waiting for our food. The food was sitting on the counter for more than half an hour with the Door Dash orders. Multiple groups of people came in after us and left before us with no problem. Eventually, we got tired of waiting and walked up and asked if the food that had been sitting on the counter was ours. They didn't call out our name, number, or anything. And it's not like we called ahead, we went to the restaurant and then ordered. The food was cold by the time we got it. The receipt that tells the name of the customer and the food was printed at 9:52, meaning that the food had been ready since then. It's 10:27 right now. Absolutely ridiculous service, and the man responsible was not apologetic at all, and when we went to complain, ran away from us and hid in the back. The manager would not give us his name so we could give a proper review. He was flirting with another worker while our food was dying on the counter. The money was refunded. The manager apologized, and I must commend her efforts to try to make this up for us. Give this manager a pay raise! The worker with the red hair was very apologetic and kind, a very sweet girl (the cashier)."
2/2/2010,4,"Alright, I know it's not fair, but I like this Bento better because it's in a better location, it's next to Mochi, it's newer, and has more seatings.Bento's is decent Asian fusion food. With the Bento box, I get a bunch of slightly above mediocre food, with enough variety to keep me satisfied. So, if you're new to Bento, this is what you do.1. Open the door 2. Look for the laminated blue menu on your right.3. Pick4. Order5. Order drink, Boba, or ask for a cup of water6. Go sit down7. Wait for food8. Eat9. Wipe faceTipping isn't required, but probably appreciated. Drinks are self-served. Private parking lot. I haven't had trouble finding parking, although this shopping center gets packed."
4/23/2010,4,"Visit Dates: 08.18, 09.03 & 10.22.2009Also known as Bento Red, this is a trendy place that is frequented by a lot of the local Asian American college youth. The place offers simple Asian fusion food, as well as sushi and bubble tea.I've had the Korean bulgogi bowl and Cantonese pork culet bento box. The bento bowls offer plenty of rice but not enough meat, while the bento boxes offer plenty of meat and other side items, but only a small cup of rice. The bubble tea was okay, as the tapioca pearls weren't firm, but rather overcooked and thus soft."
5/22/2016,5,"Went to bento on archer and got a phat seaweed salad. Didn't think it would be so phat but boy was I wrong. Anyways, I was kinda pissed that the soy sauce on my table was almost empty but nobody's perfect. Atmosphere was vibing: I laughed, I cried, I made memories to last a week. Plus, Calvin Harris was on so sushi was rage. 10/10 would probs eat again if it was Sunday night and I was on archer."
12/6/2016,4,I have had several dishes from here and they are consistently delicious. Sometimes the food can be a little bit dry. The spicy  Thai curry dishes are on point. I'm not a huge fan of their pad Thai though. Sushi  is also good too! I think their prices are reasonable for college students and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for to go any day!
7/11/2019,3,"They're ok. I went in for lunch today.. I haven't been in a while. Anyway, I ordered my favorite roll, the TNT. I was so disappointed!!! They changed the recipe. It tastes so bland now. And they added some crunchy topping on top that tastes so gross. They need to stop changing things that work. If ain't broke.. Why fix it?? I'm so dissatisfied."
3/24/2018,2,"The food is really not that great, I've tried it several times and neither the sushi nor the main platters are that good. There are many other Asian fusion restaurants in town that will not disappoint you."
8/1/2015,4,"We ordered the volcano roll, kids teriyaki chicken bento, chicken katsu curry bento, Cajun chicken bento, dew the melon milk tea with boba, peach green tea with boba.  Line was long but we received our delicious food quickly.  We will return again!"
8/18/2011,5,"Heaven on earth is at Bento Cafe!  Too bad, how often am I in Gainesville.It's probably the first and only. Not that it's a bad place, I'm just never up there.Bento was so fresh and cool looking, so modern and fun, and the menu is EXTENSIVE!!!!I have been having a taste for sushi and japanese so much lately, it's unbelievable. The location made my hubby and I happy. He got to have his chipotle, I got my japanese restaurant, and mocha our puppy got to hang out with us since there was an outside sitting area too!!!  Best of everything.I ordered a bento box. I love all of the compartments of yummy stuff. It included white rice, noodles, beans, pineapple cake, my order was Mongolian bbq, oh and I love the salad dressing for the salad also.Also, I had a sushi roll with 8 pieces. It had tuna salmon, avocado and cream cheese and their sauce. I do not remember the type of roll it was.  Man that was happiness right there.The best part of it is the price. The box is around 7.95 and the roll was 5.95. Those prices are great for all of what you get!!!!There tons of different teas, and freezy drinks and such. I wish I got to try them, but didn't get a chance to."
1/27/2017,3,"Portion got a lot smaller comparing to 2 years ago. Probably not a smart choice to get a surf and turf Togo, my salmon sashimi was half cooked when it get to my hotel."
1/24/2015,3,"I have gone to this establishment almost a hundred times, and I think it's finally time for me to give the most unbiased review ever. I have had good experiences, and also bad. I have ordered a plethora of different plates, ranging from JB rolls to udon and stir fry vegetables, and consistently, the food doesn't seem to disappoint. Sometimes, the food is bit too simplified for me, such as the katsu chicken noodle bowl ( or any noodle bowl at that... the noodles always taste the same... no special seasoning?) But it isn't inedible or bad. Just not what I would make myself as a noodle-making chef. My favorite things to order are the JB roll and the Chicken Pad thai rice bowl, which is similar to the kind of dish you'd get at an actual thai place with complementary rice. (I'm a fan of Bahn Thai, but not a fan of the price sometimes). The Pad Thai is not identical, but good enough for me to find it to be a suitable substitute when I'm feeling cheap.The one thing this chain location lacks is consistent service. Although the service is fast, and the lines move quickly a lot of the nights I go, I have gotten my dish pushed back in the kitchen a LOT, and have even had my order dropped off to the wrong table. I have gotten my order messed up too (small things: rice bowl instead of noodle bowl, etc.)Bottomline, this is good to satisfy any craving you have for pan-asian food and typical sushi, but isn't the best place in the universe. It is simply a solid choice for the college kid on a budget who wants a large variety of quickly served asian-style cuisine. I find it to be a really convenient option for dinner."
1/6/2017,4,I love the options of what you can order!!! We got a rice beef bugogi bowl which was tasty but wish there was more meat and the meat was fatty. We got the hot lava roll and Mexican roll which both tasted great but took a long time to get. Miso soup was gingery but salty and yummy. Chicken katsu was by far the best thing I have eaten there. Super crispy and moist chicken. Overall price was very good and I would recommend it!! When I visit the town i always try to eat there.
10/29/2017,2,The pad Thai is particularly bad. It left a bad aftertaste like that of stale vinegar and the sauce frankly feels like it's ketchup based.
4/17/2010,5,"A moment of clarity: sushi is like ... DIM SUM!  OK - a stretch.  One's Japanese, the other, Chinese.  Cooked - not cooked (most of it); cold - hot.  But hear me out: each is an Asian delight made delicately.  So as I peruse the menu... ""What's good?"" I asked.  Back came the equally inane response: ""Everything!""  I deserved that!OK, let's back track for background: I trotted the ponies up to GNV last night - al fresco, and flying solo (wife has to work) - at the invite of darling daughter to go see the Shitty Beatles.  So after I arrived safely, I went to Bento where our daughter works for some sustenance before the show.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  If you didn't know, Bento is one of these places where you order from the counter and they bring you your food.  Good sushi from an establishment that maybe one step down from a QSR?  ""I don't think so!"", right?  That's where I was very pleasantly surprised.  So when the food came, I laid in on the yellowtail, and tuna, and salmon...too many to list.  EVERYTHING was superbly fresh-tasting - best raw fish I've had in recent memory.  It was all washed down with some unfiltered sake that's a trifle sweet but totally delish.  Big time props to sensei sushi chef Kevin for being so masterful and helpful (and Jason for recommending the sake!)  Kevin explains that the fresh is so fish (I mean, ""the fish is so fresh"") because they're always so busy at Bento.  Judging from the packed parking lot outside and the long line inside at 9 p.m., you can't argue with that.  Kevin ""brags"" that he loves his job - partly because he gets to eat this great food; he says he's never been in better health, and looking at him, you can't argue with THAT either.  This all made for a superb prelude to a great evening at the Common Grounds, where there was a major Beatles love-in going on..wish I could review THAT.  Actually, I think ""I WILL""!  (umm - for the uninitiated, that was the title of a Beatles song :-)"
3/24/2016,4,My boss took me here the other day for lunch. He looked at me strange when I said I hadn't been here yet. What we have been here for 4 weeks or so now and you haven't been to Bento's. Nope not even in Jax I replied. Ok he is hooked on their tuna bowl with some cucumbers and other green stuff. I went with the spicy miso ramen bowl. It was all right but it was served barely warm. I like and kind of expect my ramen very hot. I'm not sure what they were trying to pull off here. It tasted pretty good but wasn't spicy at all. Now thai or whatever they are calling themselves I expected hot and spicy. Oh well it goes in the maybe not pile.
6/6/2019,1,Had to wait in line to be told there was a 25 minute wait for sushi/poke bowls. It's 1:40 pm on a weekday. They should be more prepared. This place is not fast casual. Skip if you are looking for something during your lunch break. Many other great options nearby m.
7/2/2017,4,Make your own poke bowl was great. Sushi was pretty good and so were the boba teas. Gator roll was yum! Ordering was slow but worth it. Will be back!
11/7/2016,5,Bento is one of my favorite sushi places here in Gainesville. It is so cheap for really good sushi. It definitely satisfies the sushi craving we all get every now and again but it doesn't leave a hole in your pocket! I definitely recommend
5/28/2020,1,"was not greeted when we walked in. upon asking for soy sauce we were given teriyaki sauce instead after asking if in fact it was actually soy sauce they insisted it was (it in fact wasn't) , food was lukewarm, staff members in kitchen walking around talking over food with NO MASK ON!"
3/1/2013,3,"Standard chain Japanese food, very tasty and affordable. Waitresses were very friendly. Me and my wife ordered 2 bento boxes and a spicy tuna roll for $24. It did take about 15 minutes to get our food which is not as fast as you would think for a place like this. Good place for lunch."
9/14/2017,4,"I have had their sushi, bento boxes and noodle/rice bowls. I am rarely disappointed with quality or taste. This is a great option for reasonably priced sushi that you aren't going to question the quality of. I recently decided to try their Tuna Poke bowl (pictured) and was very pleased with the quality of the tuna as well as the amount I was given. They allow you to design your own giving you several options for protein and additions (vegetables, starches and sauces). Their Spicy Cream Chicken is one of my favorites. It not overly spciy but has a nice kick to it. I have ordered it in bowl form (with just noodles or rice and broccoli or string beans) and as a bento box (comes with several smaller sides) and enjoy both. Their rolls are good as well. They have a good variety ranging from a basic Cali to the more custom rolls (Volcano, Bamboo, etc) that also have a good range of cost. They do get pretty busy during the lunch and dinner rush times so we most often order to go and pick it up. However the Archer Road location is pretty large and has a nice atmosphere if you are eating there and have a little wait. They also have a small outdoor seating area."
2/20/2017,4,Almost everything was really great.  Had the red curry chicken over brown rice.  Perfectly balanced.  The pork egg rolls were fabulous.  The steamed dumplings were good...just passable.  The Bento box was very good also.  The place could have been a little cleaner.  The atmosphere is actually a little weird...not distracting or anything...just odd.  My daughter had the sushi and she believes it was fresh.  Worth a try.
3/21/2019,1,Waited 30 minutes in an empty restaurant (no line whatsoever) on 2 orders of boba...not sure if I'm coming back but their boba tea sure as heck isn't good enough for me to be waiting this long for. Several staff walked past me and no one thought to ask why I had been waiting for so long. When I finally got my teas they were leaking all over my hands and the bobas tasted old and hard. The cashier who took my order acted like she did not want to be there. Poor customer service all around. I'm so disappointed as I use to enjoy coming here but seems like both quality of food and customer service has been declining a lot.
3/18/2017,1,Had a very long line. Only one person taking orders. I wanted to order sushi but they informed me it would be 30 extra wait for sushi. So I ordered a rice bowl and noodle bowl with an extra sauce. Sure she said. All the tables are very dirty. My one noodle bowl comes out. No extra sauce. Wait 5 minutes. Go ask for the sauce. Did you get charged for it? I don't know I asked for it when I paid. They look through the receipts. I just give them a dollar. Dude I just want the sauce.
2/19/2019,2,"Last time for me at Bento.  Quality has gone down.  Very expensive for what you get.  Fried rice and vegetables tasted like it was from an all-you-can-eat buffet....cold and tasteless. Fried wontons also lacked flavor. Mexican Roll (our go to roll) was not up to par. Again, very little taste.  Gave us the wrong order and had to go back to the store.  Condiments missing from the bag.  I hope  the one on Newberry Road is maintaining its quality.  I'm done with Bento on Archer Road."
8/26/2011,4,Wonderful and efficient!!!!My table was sticky but the ambiance was cool!  AND I enjoyed my meal and boboa tea!  Coming here next month!
2/16/2017,3,"I was in the mood for a rice bowl and this was the closest restaurant to my hotel.  The ordering system was a bit strange and I'm not sure if I actually got what I ordered but it was pretty good since I finished the whole thing.  Price was a little higher than I'm used to (in Los Angeles) but not too high.  It was busy and the wait was not too long.  I did not try the sushi but noticed it was popular as I waited for my order.   I will try again and eat in, maybe explore the menu a bit more."
11/15/2015,2,"Bit of a downtick in my rating for Bento Cafe based on my most recent experience.Plusses include freshness of the food. Also, I would say that their spicy cream noodle bowl, particularly with shrimp, is their specialty. The shrimp are segments similar to their shrimp tempura, paired with soba noodles, and coated with their spicy cream sauce-slash-glaze; the mouth feel and flavor are excellent. Their General Tso's chicken is pretty good, almost as good as the hole-in-the-wall New York style Chinese place up the street from my home. Their spicy mayo sauce, often served alongside sushi, is more flavorful than I've had elsewhere, with ample bits of flavorful spice.Minuses include portion sizes; specifically, if you get a noodle bowl, well over 3/4 of the dish will consist of cheap, carb-laden noodles, and 1/4 or less of your chosen protein. Their $7 or so shrimp tempura appetizer consists of rather small shrimp a bit shorter than and about the diameter, with tempura batter, of an Oscar Meyer wiener. Their 8-piece spicy tuna sushi has a meager amount of tuna and the roll size is even smaller than what you might find in the local supermarket's sushi section, and also has arrived disconcertingly lukewarm; I feel a lot better about raw-fish sushi when it arrives nicely ice-cold. Speaking of temperature, the couple of times I've ordered soup, it's been just barely warm; this after having just picked it up on site. Worst so far has been their disgusting attempt at red curry, which was a lukewarm, tarry mess; the first thing that pops into mind with a red curry should NOT be ""clotted cream"", yet that's what it looked like, I couldn't finish it. In short, there are a very few things Bento Cafe seems to do right aside from those very few things that I find consistently delicious. I'd recommend sticking with better choices in town, like Bangkok Square for good Thai, and Mahzu for their great weekday sushi lunch specials and excellent shrimp tempura."
2/3/2019,4,"My favorite go to spot. A variety of selections plus vegetarian options. I love their sushi, my go to order is the sushi combo box with double Mt. Fuji rolls. You can dine indoor, patio, or take out. Very convenient, and their food is not overly priced."
1/7/2017,3,Not the best sushi you can get in town but pretty good for time and price. Their raw salmon bowl is always good.
2/19/2017,5,Great place to hangout and enjoy some delicious Sushi and Asian food. Pineapple Thai Fried Rice must recommended. Also the Spring Rolls.
4/4/2019,5,This place is really good. It's affordable & you get a lot of food for the price. The sushi tastes great & the menu variety is really pleasing.
8/9/2014,4,"I'm basing my review solely on the sushi, as I've eaten nothing else off the menu. I've gotten sushi takeout here on several occasions and I've been satisfied every time. Nothing has wowed me, but the consistency is impressive.Service has always been courteous, the sushi is prepared in a timely manner, and prices are reasonable. Although this is not the most amazing sushi I have ever tasted, it is definitely good and worth the price."
10/22/2014,4,The Sichuan beef noodle tastes really good. And Taiwan rice noodle is very special. Asahi beer NICE!!
8/20/2016,1,The front counter service was extremely slow. The food came out at a glacial pace. There was no ice in the fountain drink machine. Overall this was a more disappointing than usual stop at Bento for run-of-the-mill mediocre sushi.
7/2/2018,4,"I absolutely love this place and their food. My favorite food is their miso soup, and the bento fried rice with spicy mayo in it, so delicious! They have a super clean restaurant. It's not outrageously expensive, however it is a bit more expensive than other places with this type of food. I love getting the sushi combo box because it's a really good deal for the price.  Getting two 4 piece classic rolls and and 8 piece California roll. I wish that the signature rolls weren't so much though. They have a decently quick service. I like how they can give you a number and just deliver it to your table so you don't have to sit and wait at the front for your food to be ready. They package to-go foods really nicely as well and give you everything you need in the bag with you. This is place is a really good place to go with friends, although the bill can get quite expensive. Overall one of my favorite places to go to when I'm in the food for fried rice or sushi."
7/18/2015,2,"The food menu doesnt have right set up to understand what is going on there . So  u will spend  15 mins just looking for what u want and how u want it . Then the waiting line is way too long so u will forget what u want  by time u get there to order :) .. Then u want find table for u but its an adventure too . Not too many tables are cleaned from costumers before or if they are ""clean"" they dont look clean how u would like .. Food is done pretty fast just we went there with my girlfriend and i get food way before her so together dinner ended that one looked how other is chewing .. I ordered Bento fried rice with shrimp and here is what i get : 7 shrimp with ""fried"" rice .. just bland taste of soy souce . U Dont even know u have fried rice because the soy sauce made it so soft that u think u have steam rice . No other taste that soy and soy . So the vegi or shrimp is like screaming in dark .. My GF ordered Udon stir fry noodle bowl with shrimp and my food and her food had only one differece . I get rice and she had noodles . but taste of Soy all over and little over salty .. But again boring plate for saturday dinner . This place maybe look fancy but need keep up with cleaning and find thetaste of Asia or Japan"
12/29/2015,1,"Scorpion roll is supposed to contain fried soft shell crab. I received lame, shrivels of what might be crab. Called back, they first said I could get an appetizer. I requested the manager. Manager said he would handle it. They sent me another sushi roll. Same infuriatingly poor quality. Left was the first order (forced to eat). Right is the second order. Both Scorpion Rolls, both disappointing."
9/9/2018,3,"Personally I love everything at bentos . The spicy cream , chicken Katsu , special Mexican roll and poke bowls ! But DONT GET the UDON soup! It's horrible . They used to have a chicken and broccoli soup that use to cure any hangover now they have these these horrible soups that just taste like miso . Bring chicken and broccoli soups to al locations back!!!!"
10/29/2014,3,"They don't bring food orders together, this really really bugs me. The entire order should come out at the same time. Other than that the food is good, not great. I'd say average. The atmosphere is lively, good for groups."
3/13/2014,1,"UGH. This place has HORRIBLE QUALITY FOOD! My mom and I got the ""Bento box"" of the tofu curry and the Bento box of tofu stir fry...... Might I say I LOVE tofu... it did not taste like tofu not one bit. My meal came with baby corn and straight up it tasted like canned corn.... so i asked the waitress...she asked the cook.... and it WAS CANNED CORN! ew! I tasted the sodium and preservatives and I dont doubt the tofu was any different. on top of that we both got some colddddddddd miso soup like straight up  COLD. not even warm or slight warm. Honestly the best things on our meal were the rice kripsies, the taken back now HOT miso soup and the ginger salad. and if you think about it....1. Rice krispies: come premade and of course there good....its sugar2. Miso soup: all it is is soup with onion and wakame.....simple3. Ginger salad: Its just lettuce with dressing.....at least it was washedmehhhhhhh i totally regret ordering food to-go when we ordered food in the first place.... we would NOT have ordered to go if we knew how bad quality there food was. i wish i asked for our money back."
4/2/2014,5,"It doesn't get much better in Gainesville!Food (I had the Spicy Cream Chicken + Rice)- Very good!  I'm not a big fan of Americanized Chinese food.  While this dish looked like your typical orange chicken, it was nothing like it!  The flavor was very even and delicious.  I attempted to save some for lunch the next day, but ended up eating it all.Atmosphere (casual)- The atmosphere was great, you can take a casual date there or go in a big group.  Price (reasonable)- I think there were some pretty affordable combo boxes with sushi rolls and sides also that I wanted to tryService (friendly)- I was able to talk to the servers and cashiers while asking them questions about the menu without feeling rushed.  They were all very friendly."
5/19/2016,5,Have to place when we are in or near Gainesville. Love the food! Bento boxes and sushi - yummy.
6/23/2014,4,"A friend recommended this place for a quick bite.  (We were on the run and ordered carryout).  Compared to a previous night of crappy Asian food, I was so thankful she told us about it.They offer noodle and rice bowls as well as sushi and various appetizers.  It's a pretty casual place so the food wasn't gourmet but it definitely was good for what it was.My fiance had the Thai chicken fried rice (or was it the chicken Thai fried rice...?) and I had the basil beef, which was served over a bed of rice.  They were both pretty good, but after trying his dish, I DEFINITELY had order envy.  The fried rice had hints of both coconut curry and spice and everything in it just worked really well.  Portions were pretty sizable for me and I was glad my fiance forgot about his leftovers, because I finished both of ours the next day.  Nom.Will definitely be returning and trying other selections!"
2/6/2017,2,"Pricing: The prices are not bad, but a bit more expensive than some students are looking for. Additionally, condiments like sriracha are not unlimited;rather, you are charged 50 cents for a side. 3/5Food: The food here can be only described as ""adequate"". The curries are not very flavourful or hot and the sushi is just ok. I can't name any particular dish that they do well. Hot dishes are almost always lukewarm. That said, the menu is expansive so most people can find something they like. There are vegetarian options, but watch out as yellow curry has fish and miso soup has oyster.  Bento box is good. 2,5/5Atmosphere: The atmosphere is trendy. Cool lighting, various seating options, a coke freestyle machine. Lavatories are bit filthy at times. 3,5/5Parking: Decent parking is available and location is convenient 3,5/5Service: The service is so weird here. The staff are friendly enough and the issue is more timing than staff. Sometimes the food comes right out and sometimes well... I've had a few times where one person's dish arrives 20 minutes before everybody else's at the table. That is awkward and there really is no reason for that. 2,5/5Takeaway: Bento takeaway is rather pricey and takes awhile (comment on delivery company not restaurant itself). However, the restaurant always manages to mess up the order (putting chicken in a vegetarian dish for instance). Not always nice about getting refund/redo when you call them. 2/5 Overall: A fun spot for a meal with friends. Come for the atmosphere rather than the food itself. Not sure why some people rave about it really."
11/22/2013,3,"The food had WAY too much sauce on it and the line was incredibly slow.  Way too much on the menus (I think there were three menus?) so everyone takes forever to order.I give it a 3 though because with more staff to speed the line up and if I asked for light sauce next time it would probably be good.  Pei Wei is much better though, although not in Gainesville."
11/17/2013,2,"The food was just ok... Not close to the value/taste in food that should've went hand in hand with the wait.   By wait I mean, the 25 minutes it took to just order, while waiting in a line up front.  I'll give a slight benefit of doubt to them because it was a college town and everybody seemed to be paying for one.. However, there were 3 huge menus that were very confusing and it took me awhile to order.  There should have been waiters and just made it a sit down restaurant.  I got a spicy chicken bento box, the chicken was alright, but there was WAY too much sauce.  Didn't like the salad dressing at all either.  The sushi I ordered was not bad though, and came pretty fast."
6/26/2013,5,"I was never really a fan of sushi, but my wifey loves this place and now she has me hooked.  We like to get pick up orders every once in a while after a long day at work.  I always get the same thing- create a roll with tuna, cucumber, cream cheese, avocado and spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo is AMAZING.... usually sushi is so bland to me but the mayo makes it a flavor explosion in my mouth!!!"
10/24/2016,3,"Ordered the 4 pc Florida roll, it was pretty inexpensive (under $5). I came while it was a little busy, three other people were waiting for their orders as well, but it came out in an average amount of time, only took about 15 minutes. The sushi was very good, I wish it was a little bigger though. I would come back to try some of the other things, but I'll probably stick to Sushi-2-Go for quick/cheap sushi."
3/29/2013,1,"-Three menus that only serve to confuse. -Ordered a meal with ""shrimp, scallops, and squid."" Received a meal with 3 shrimp, 4 squid pieces, and a single scallop. -Perhaps the second worst restaurant experience in Gainesville."
12/13/2009,3,"I expected more from Bento, given all the hype. I liked my bobba tea, I did. There was nothing bad about it, it was delicious. As was the bento box I got.The place was packed and yes, it was very loud. Someone sitting next to us was apparently out on their birthday and got the humiliating happy birthday song from the staff. It's a decent place, with more than decent food. Perhaps the freshmen that get creepier and more like miley cyrus each fall will claim to love Bento, but foodies beware. Bento has a lot of word of mouth hype going for it, and I'm not quite sure that it deserves it.Momoyaki, Tatu, Sake Cafe, Dragonfly, Saigon, etc, etc are all asian options in Gainesville. There's no need to go to Bento all the time. But yes, for what its worth they serve up standard food, fast."
11/17/2014,1,"Six words: small portions, disappointing food, no service.This place seems more about presentation and not the actual food itself. The experience overall is abysmal, mostly concentrated on the food, and what you get for the cost. The break-down: I ordered a shrimp bento box. It came with white rice, lo mein, green beans, and ginger salad, followed by four bread crisp-things lightly topped with a milky-white sweet paste. The shrimp was the best thing on the plate. Tender and fresh-tasting... But that's where the excitement and anticipation of a good meal (for $9.25) died.The white rice was warm; yet dry. The lo mein was dry and cold. That was not a typo-it indeed, sadly, was cold and bland. (All lo mein lovers know that it is supposed to be warm and moist...). A few warm noodles were to be found, unfortunately that couldn't even pull through due to a ""day old"" taste that accompanied it.The green beans were warm, yet extremely limp and overall unsatisfying. It had a light butter coating, but it produced no flavor. Some green beans were limp to the point that my fork could not pick them up because the beans had no substance... Very sad.The ginger salad was the complete opposite though: totally overpowering and electrifyingly-strong. I couldn't even finish it (my companion who dined with me didn't even take a second bite of theirs). And last but not least, the ""dessert""... The little sweet crisps.. Not too bad, the sauce was just right. Disappointingly enough though, they measure no longer than an inch, and are incredibly thin. Since the establishment only provides four of these, it barely suffices to be considered a dessert- more-so like a precursor to an actual dessert. Overall, after our lunch was finished (me and my companion both ordered a bento box), we went out to get more food at a separate restaurant to no longer be hungry. $20 will not fill you and your guest up at Bento Café.The atmosphere itself is serene, while lacking the culture-touch of anything relating to Japan, hardly. Its very dark inside, and is not necessarily pleasing to those who don't exactly deem red/black colors to be pleasant to the eyes. Red and black everywhere...very depressing feel to the place, as a few other Yelpers have stated. I will not be returning anytime soon unless their minuté portions and gloomy food quality changes."
8/28/2018,5,"Love the spicy cream chicken and general tsos. The lo mein bowl is delicious, but get the bento box if you want more variety in your sides."
7/3/2015,3,"Sushi with ""fast food"" attitude. Over all the food was good but the atmosphere of a fast food restaurant where you order in line and then deal with a snarky staff takes away from the experience. So in short this is like fast food sushi."
6/26/2015,3,"This was my first time here and it's not bad at all. I had the Tsunami and Teriyaki sushi combos. They are your average small pieces of sushi. Not big at all since they weren't specialty rolls. I also had the Chirashi which is a similar version to the Poke bowl. Just raw chopped up fish on a bed of rice. The sushi was decent for the price. The cucumber lacked flavor and seasoning. It wasn't pickled right. If you're looking for something fast and cheap, this is your place right here. Otherwise, I'd leave a date night to a more formal Japanese sushi restaurant."
9/23/2018,5,"I love their sushi! My favorite roll is the Mt. Fuji roll, would highly recommend. Some of the best sushi in Gainesville for a reasonable price."
11/8/2010,4,"Remember those awesome tall plastic cups with cute little characters on them that you once received when you ate there? Yeah, well sad to say, they no longer exist. *sad face*The food is still good, super packed as usual but those cups! Bring 'em back, Bento's. that is all.I realize I shouldn't penalize the review for the lack of not having *those* cups anymore so...I'm still a fan but barely."
9/9/2016,4,I got the chicken teriyaki and was very pleased with the taste of the chicken. My fiancé also now comes here regularly for their Pad Thai.
6/18/2015,5,Love this place! They have a great menu and the sushi and sashimi is so so good. The prices are great for the amount of food you get  So many choices!
2/19/2013,3,"Bento's has decent food. After trying the different locations in Gainesville and Orlando, it's pretty much the same. The style of food is Pan-Asian. If you're looking for moderately priced food, this is a good place to go. There are so many things you can choose from on the menu including a sushi menu. I could go on and on about the different things I have tried here but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu's. The Archer Rd location recently expanded the location and doubled the size but on the weekends, this place is still busy so plan for a crowd!"
3/23/2018,2,"The food is good though the price is just a tad steep. See other reviews for food review. I've been familiar with Bento for 12 years now and the one thing that is consistent other than the above-average sushi is the consistent delay. The line is often long and there is often only one person taking orders. While polite, this doesn't compensate for their understaffing. The wait for food is excessively long, approaching 45-60 minutes for something expected to be much faster. Manager isn't anywhere in sight and workers don't seem to be eager to work more efficiently. This isn't the Bento of the 2000's or early 2010's. Bento was once the premier Asian casual food of Gainesville, and I hope they can achieve it once again."
2/22/2012,4,"This was the go-to spot for my friends and I during our college days! It's fun, trendy, and affordable!They recently expanded the restaurant into the neighboring office space so the seating area is huge now! The restaurant feels more open and is better able to accommodate larger parties.The taste and quality of the food was still as good as I remembered. There are plenty of choices on the menu ranging from bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, soups, and sushi. You can get a good-sized meal, and maybe even some leftovers, for under $10!Some of my favorite dishes are the Thai Coconut Curry, Curry Katsu, Bulgolgi, Cantonese Pork Chop, and Udon Stir Fry Noodle. From the sushi menu, my 2 favorite rolls here are the Red Dragon and Sonny Side Up. Any of the sashimi bowls are just as good, too! Can't forget my milk tea with boba, either!"
2/10/2015,4,"Went for dinner here, got myself some crab cheese wontons with Chicken Katsu Noodle bowl, everything was really good. The ambiance of this place is good - guess they sometimes have Karaoke too, I would definitely recommend this place for those in the city, if you have never tried japanese/asian cuisine."
2/4/2010,3,"This place is definitely one of the most popular place in Gville.  You can ask almost anyone, they will tell you all about it.  Bento is a normal Asian fusion food place.  But what separates them from other restaurants, it is their atmosphere.  Food-   Their food quality is alright.  The reason why I say that, it is because I am Asian, I have worked in a restaurant since I was 8 years old and I know what ingredients are cheap and are not.  Most of the beef, they seemed to be flanks.  Their sushi rolls are pretty amazing.  The design of the roll is pretty creative,  I mean they have most of the common rolls, in addition to the new ones that they created. The presentation of the rolls are pretty good.  The flavors of the rolls is good too.  To be honest, the price that you pay for the food that we receive is fair.  The bento box does contain a fair amount of food to fill you up, The noodle bowl too.  Overall, the food is fine.  The service is inconsistent because sometimes they forget about you. So it takes them a while to bring food.   The only bad thing about Bento, it is their set up.  Poor set up, because it has line wrapped around in front of the entrance, so It prevents people to go in and go the back of the line.  I wish they set it up to be more efficient.  In addition, people who orders to go,  got no place to stand or sit besides the two high top tables that they have by the entrance.   But the set up is fairly simple.  You go in, grab a menu that is two sided and you order in the cashier and you wait. Kinda like a Mcdonald place.  Bad thing is that it gets really busy and they always need more help because they always backed up on orders. I have not tried their boba tea yet,  I have a high expectation for boba tea, And something tells me, Bento might not be able to meet it. But we shall see next time."
4/11/2015,4,I enjoy Bento Cafe a lot. Their service is speedy and their food is good. The Bento box is a great deal.
3/31/2015,1,"Terrible management of peak volume. Took me over 45 minutes to get my order. It looked like total chaos, and noticed as several other people complained about their orders as well."
2/25/2010,4,"I've been eating at both bentos since they've originally opened . . . and I must say that overall, I'm definitely a fan.  There have been great days, and not so great days . . . but overall, for the affordable price, i'm not going to complain that much.  I must say that my favorite thing to order is the Szechuan Beef Noodle Bowl . . . some times I've had it where the beef is so tender it just melts in your mouth . . . unfortunately last time this wasn't the case . . . it was too tough . . . but the flavor was still great.Their red tea (with pearls) is also quite delicious and is great with your meal or just by itself.It's got a fantastic ambience and it's definitely a happening place!*NOTE* Oh, and ladies beware, last weekend they had a sign on the women's bathroom door saying the lock was broken so as a courtesy to please knock prior to opening the door!!!"
8/15/2011,4,"My Boyfriend and I were in need of a quick, but tasty dinner last night and swung by our regular haunt, only to find it closed on a sunday. While driving down Archer we were naming places to go...Firehouse? A Publix Sub...no we wanted asian...hmmm BENTO? wow, yea we havent been there together ever, and I hadnt been there in a long time. Went inside, looked at the menu, it was all coming back to me. Bento boxes, Sashimi bowls, noodles, sushi. I decided on the spicy tuna sashimi bowl, and he got the Cantonese Pork chop Bento Box. Mine was a generous huge portion of raw tuna with spicy sauce, Avocado, wakame salad, rice, flying fish roe, sesame seeds. His Bento Box came with the pork chop, lo mein noodles, fresh salad with ginger dressing, stir fry green beans, rice, and a cream puff. Both, with two drinks came to just under 20 bucks. It was delicious. My tuna was really fresh and the rice was cooked perfectly. His pork chop was so amazing, and I being his main squeeze took my liberty of trying a few chunks of its yummy unctiousness.I dont know what to make of the interior, its always puzzled me. Sleek, modern, booths lit with a red light, I think we saw a karaoke set up in a corner. Its not exactly ""cozy"" but its not so offputting that I would avoid eating there. We will definitely go back!"
7/9/2013,4,Pretty good food overall. I love the Mexican sushi roll with eel sauce. Their chinese dishes typically have good flavor but sometimes they put too much sauce in the dish for my liking. Nice environment to have a sit in meal otherwise take out is an option and the food is ready pretty quickly
9/12/2016,3,Excruciatingly.  Long. Wait. Was here to pick sushi. No queue at all. But took twenty minutes for the sushi to be prepared. Not coming back here!
1/23/2016,4,"This place isnt authentic sushi, but its a good place to go when your craving a deep fried roll or a bento box."
11/24/2009,3,"Closest thing Gainesville has to Pei Wei (which is far superior).Trendy, popular environment with lighted tables, TVs, and seemingly always busy. Staff isn't that friendly, but food arrives in a timely fashion even when busy. Typical pan-Asian menu, expect to pay about $10 for a meal.  Bento boxes have great variety, but the rice bowls are more filling.Delivery not recommended because the food will most likely arrive soggy."
6/26/2015,4,I really enjoy this place. Everyone is friendly and  Service is fast. Sushi tastes fresh and prices are spot on!  I wish they offered agedashi tofu on the appetizer menu. Love that they serve coke products But not a fan of the new coke touch screen machines. They have a wide variety of sushi/sashimi and noodle bowls as well.  For my experiences here the only thing I think is a problem is the ordering.  The line seems to take a very long time during the ordering process. They teas with the tapioca pearls are very popular.  They also serve beer and wine by the bottles. I do recommend this place. Enjoy!
8/2/2011,3,"We were on a college visit with my son to UF and went to Yelp to see what was good and close to us - so glad we discovered Bento Café on Archer Road. A quarter mile from the hotel, just off I-75, and close to campus.The Bento Box is a great deal for $7.50. You get a little bit of everything (meat, veggies, rice, noodles, salad and beans). The meat portions are a little small - so if you are hungry look at augmenting with some sushi. The bulgogi beef was more dry spiced than it was a wet marinade. The General Tso's Chicken was very good.The sushi is moderate + priced. Not the greatest sushi I have had - but I wouldn't turn it down.If you want something different, out of the ordinary (not a full up restaurant dinner or a McNugget meal) and don't want a huge hit in your wallet, then Bento is the place.They serve beer and wine, soda and tea's."
7/8/2011,4,"My best friend introduced me to this place, and I am hooked. I used to get a bento box of Teriyaki chicken, but not I get the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with extra eel sauce. Their eel sauce is a teriyaki sauce and honestly, I have no idea why it was called eel sauce. Their BOBA TEAS are to die for, but add pearls. The pearls are really gummy and don't really have a flavor to me. My friend and I like to take the big straw that you get with your boba tea and shoot the pearls at one another which is a lot of fun. I like the thai tea and the red bean. The tea tops have really cool plastic covers on them. I love this place and the green beans are amazing!!!!"
12/26/2014,4,"Good prices. Good sushi. I especially am a fan of the Spicy Salmon Don - which is a bowl of spicy salmon with rice, seaweed salad, avocado and roe."
1/16/2012,4,"Got carry-out on a Saturday night. I think we ordered two sushi rolls and a noodle dish. The carry-out sushi was great. It comes with a little seaweed salad which was mediocre but the sushi and the other dish were delicious. I'm definitely going to try dining in here and want to try a lot of the other menu items.Didn't dine inside, but it looked like they were going for some sort of club feel with all the neon lights and decor. Kinda tacky, but if the food is good, I'll buy."
8/8/2012,4,"This is a great spot for a quick lunch. Sometimes there is a long line, but the food always comes out pretty quickly. There's something for everyone on the menu. I'm not a fan of raw fish and always get a cooked chicken roll at sushi places, and the one here is as good as any I've had. Good prices, too."
4/23/2011,4,"During this visit with my boyfriend (who loves this spot from undergrad & grad school days), I ordered the TnT roll.  It was deliciously spicy and the tuna tasted so fresh.Also, as my alternative to boba tea, I ordered an iced green tea with lychee jelly.  So refreshing!  My boyfriend always gets the Dew the Melon boba drink, which really does tastes like a milky cantaloupe drink!  Delicious!"
11/21/2011,4,"Fresh and healthy.  For some reason, people in this part of the country are really into having cream cheese in their sushi - but don't worry, the sushi here is made to order so you can always nix that cream chesse out of there (if you're not into it).  I ordered a special sushi roll and did a 'create your own' sushi roll (salmon, tuna, carrot and cucmber) and it was awesome.  This place also has an array of sauces that you can order on the side (and the spicy red chili sauce is awesome when mixed with soysauce - instead of using wasabi and soy).  The cucumber salad was refreshing as well - as it should be.Florida is a large penisula, so they should be able to produce quality sushi, even if they are inland (i.e. Gainesville).  I was very happy to find this Japanese oasis and will definitely be coming here the next time I'm in town."
10/11/2014,5,Excellent food! One of my favorite restaurants in Gainesville :) everything on the menu is delicious!!
10/13/2017,2,"Ordered the ginger scallion bento box, the rice was the best part. The salad had the tiniest bit of dressing on the bottom. Most of the lettuce was dry. The ginger scallion chicken had only the slightest taste of ginger and was bland. If you want crab wantons, go to Dragonfly. Bento's wantons are doughy and so bad. But hey! At least you get $1 off Mochi with the receipt."
5/17/2011,4,"A good mix of Asian dishes.  Sushi, Bento Box, Chinese Noodle soup, etc.  Their sushi's quality is fresh and the variety is great.   Spicy Salmon bowl is one of my favorite.   Their Sushi Rolls are also excellent and delicious.   Cantonese Pork Chop is also very good. Most of their dishes are under $10.  I just moved from another state where you can't get quality/fresh sushi for under $10.  To top it off, get their Bubble Tea.Service is fast.  Sometimes there are lines to order during busiest hours, but it is not too bad.  They have daily specials.  There are 2 locations in Gainesville, one on Archer, and another one on Newberry.  Both are equally good. When I go to the Archer location, I usually don't get the bubble tea.  Instead, I'll go next door to the Frozen Yogurt shop (Mochi).This place has so much variety that we went there every weekend for 3 straight weeks.  It's a must-try for Sushi at least."
7/26/2014,3,I honestly went here and did not love it. The rolls were decent but I felt the environment was dirty and cold. Though my friend liked it. And the prices are good
4/1/2010,4,"Three years ago if you had given me sushi I would have spit it out. I literally did once during dinner with some friends my senior year of high school. To my credit, it was a terrible California Roll. Why people call them the ""safest"" roll to try I don't know. Maybe if it had been slathered with soy sauce and some tuna it would have tasted better.Fast forward a few years later and I can't get enough of the stuff. Tempura fried, filled with cream cheese, topped with mosago... you name and I will try it. My favorite place, however, is Bento Cafe on Archer Road in Gainesville. They have quick, casual pan-asian cuisine and sushi, according to the cafe's site.To start, the decor is chic and hip without being overly trendy. Accents of red and stainless steel highlight the cafe, while large television sets let you watch anything from anime to the latest basketball game. Sometimes the line can get a little backed up if you decide to go right in the thick of meal times, but the staff is pretty good at moving things along.If you like crunchy with a kick of spice then the Red Dragon Roll is for you. Mixed inside is shrimp tempura, crab, cream cheese, masago and avocado. The roll is topped with tuna and decorated with spicy sauce. The cream cheese melts in your mouth, while the texture of the tempura gives you a light unexpected crunch.If sushi isn't exactly your thing, they do have Bento Boxes and rice bowls that will satisfy any craving. Or try the Katsu Chicken Rice Bowl with chicken deep-fried in Japanese panko breading served with a tangy Tonkatsu sauce.Stop in for weekly specials and new rolls. Bento Cafe also boasts a wide variety of Japanese teas like boba, green, red and thai.*TIP* to beat the lines during meal times call ahead and pick-up your order."
7/7/2011,4,"The majority of my friends love and rave about Bento so much that there was one point in time I went there every Friday night with my roommates. The place kind of lost its glamour to me after a month of that (which might've been because I only ever ordered one of two things on the menu), but I still went back every so often. I don't know why, but this place has sort of become my hangover-recuperation spot. I don't know what they put in their soup, but I swear, I always go in looking like a hot mess and I wind up walking out looking a little bit more like a human being after a bowl. Some of my friends say that their noodle soup tastes salty like it has MSG in it, but I don't really notice. My failsafe dish is always their Szechuan Tofu (mmm!). But in my latest  visit to Bento last weekend, I tried out their A Ramen (which might be a new addition to the menu?), and it's /amazing/. I always, ALWAYS leave with a to-go box because their portions are usually too big for me to finish, but I pretty much inhaled the entire bowl of their ramen. Noodles were perfect, enoki mushrooms were a nice touch - it's not like the ramen you'd have in Asia, but for Gainesville Asian cuisine standards? This is pretty good. It's definitely worth a try!"
5/29/2015,4,"Had Bento quite a few times at this location and it's good overall. Sometimes it gets busy during peak hours but the food comes in a reasonable amount of time. Food is amazing most of the time, service is about average. Atmosphere is great, would recommend for any general occasion."
3/2/2017,3,"Food is decent. Some days better than others. They do not accept call in orders prior to their opening at 11:30. That is pretty inconvenient when you take lunch at 11:30 and would like it to be ready around that time. When they finally answer at 11:35 it takes ""15-20 minutes"" to prepare. Not great for those with a 30 minute lunch."
5/6/2015,1,"The good:-Quick service. If you are looking for a place to grab a quick meal this is it. 15-20 minutes and your food will be in front of you.-Location. Located right next across from Butler Plaza. Parking is a little short during lunch/dinner hours since there are other food establishments nearby. Always stop at Mochi for dessert.-Decent menu optionThe bad:-The staff placing orders do not know their menu well. I ordered the katsu noodle soup bowl but asked prior to placing the order what kind of broth does the noodle soup come in (chicken or fish). She told me I can get it with the chicken broth which was what I ordered. When I received the my noodle soup bowl I noticed immediately that the broth was a fish broth. When asked to fix my order the server told me she cannot because this item only comes with a fish broth. 1) That is not what I was told when placing my order 2) Aren't the broths pre-made? Can't you just put the chicken broth in my bowl instead of the fish one? 3) If you are having a bad day, don't take it out on your customer. -The lighting is too dim! It is very difficult to see with only red lights on. I appreciate the candles in each table but those did not help much. My friends joked that they dimmed the place up so you can't see the roaches that could be crawling around or the other rodents you don't want seeing next to your meal. I am starting to think they got it on the dot with that one. -Not the best in customer service. Just get your food, eat, and leave."
9/18/2014,4,We ordered one sushi roll to go and although it wasn't that busy it took forever!!! But it was worth it. I think I can honestly say it is the best sushi I've had in Gainesville. Haven't tried other food items but the sushi is really good although pricy.
7/8/2011,4,"Bento makes me glad to be back in Gainesville. The one place I missed the most while living in Miami... Hard to find a sushi bowl as good as the Spicy T-Una Don... Thick pieces of eel, plenty of tuna pieces, seaweed and fish roe for only $6.95!  I hope this place never realizes that a bowl like this would be well over $10 just about anywhere else.... but it's a college town, so my wallet is thankful...Their boba milk teas are the best I have ever...period."
9/15/2011,3,"Udon noodles may be the ultimate comfort food.  On a rainy day, these thick warm noodles are absolute heaven.  As far as we're concerned when it comes to an udon dish it's all about the noodles; which was a useful attitude during our recent visit to the ever hip and popular Bento Café.  We ordered the Red Curry Beef Bowl, described as ""a very spicy Malaysian curry dish"", which we found surprisingly mild.  The beef was tender and the vegetables were crunchy but there just wasn't any heat. But who cares, the noodles were terrific.We also sampled the Szechuan Tofu Bento Box.  The tofu in this dish was extremely silky and went well with the mild garlic and ginger flavors of the Szechuan sauce.  The dish's noodles were firm and the beans were crisp but the rice was a bit dry and the ginger dressing lacked substantial ginger.  While the bento box offered a good quantity and variety of food, we think that next time we'll go with a more singularly focused dish like a rice bowl or noodle soup."
12/5/2014,2,"Not a fan of this place. The only good think is the service. The sushi is not that great, they are always super busy, and the bubba teas are not that tasty."
1/10/2014,4,Almost everything I've had here has been good both of cooked and raw ingredients. The raw sushi could stand to taste a little fresher but still beats Publix sushi and the like.
1/18/2015,4,"The food is fantastic, but sometimes the atmosphere detracts from the experience.  The servers are typically professional but for some reason they always put the cranky one at the register.  Also, take-out orders are frequently wrong.  A little customer service training for the staff would go a long way."
4/6/2011,3,"I've dined in and ordered food from Bento since 2006. Their sushi is good, and after a few bouts of trail and error I was able to narrow down my top favorite dishes from them. However, I'd recommend NOT getting the following: boba tea (Lollicup is better), edamame (way overpriced and you're given a small portion), or ANY Bento box (their desserts are lame and the salad isn't good).They have a nice atmosphere and have played some interesting movies while I've dined in (including Up). I'd recommend eating there, but at a random time (it can get REALLY noisy)."
8/19/2013,3,"I've gone to Bento before. I'm only biased with the Jacksonville location because a lot of my friends work there! This bento, well, let's just say they are SUPER busy. On that note, half of my party's food came, the other did not come in until we were done eating. It was mostly the sushi that took forever, but when everyone got their food, they were pleased! I tried the Katsu Chicken Udon. I love Katsu, but I wanted to taste their Udon noodles. I have had better tasting broth, so next time, I think I will stick to a Sushi Bento box or just a regualr bento box! My friend had a side of pan-friend noodles and they were a little cold. We asked if they could heat it up, and they did so."
5/23/2014,3,"Got the food to go so can't speak for the ambience inside the restaurant. Food was pretty decent; not among the best asian food you can get, but really worth a visit at least once. Their boxes are always good options, and you can customize your order pretty thoroughly so you're sure to get what you actually want."
3/18/2014,5,"Best casual sushi place in Gainesville I've been to so far. Pieces of sushi are large and delicious. Many different options, and I like to sit at the sushi bar because the sushi rollers are friendly"
10/27/2014,1,"This review is for the quality of service.  I have eaten at Bento more times than I care to say and was extremely disappointed by the service I received today at the Archer Road location.  First, I was sitting outside waiting for a friend to arrive when one of the employees came over to the table next to me.  The bowl she was going to deliver wasn't correct.  She was confused and walked back in.  A minute later another employee walked out and said she was the one that took her order and that this was what she ordered because she read the order back to her.  The customer said I am not sure but that is not what I want or what I thought I ordered.  The employee gave her a look and walked back inside.  When her friend showed up to eat with her from another restaurant she told him the story and wasn't too happen they were blaming the wrong order on her.My friend arrived and we placed our order.  I listened closely as she read the order back.  Whew..it was correct.  After our food was delivered to us the same employee that i saw confront the customer outside about her order come over to  my table.  I was thinking the order is correct i wonder why she is coming over here, maybe to see if we needed anything and if everything was okay.  Instead she says they forgot to charge me for the brown rice in my bowl and asked me to give her a dollar!!!!  We were so shocked that we gave it to her.  Afterwords I said I should have told her that wasn't my fault and remind her of what I saw her tell a customer outside not 10 minutes earlier.If this is the type of customer service we are to expect from Bento now I would imagine that their  very busy and profitable restuaruants would start to lose faithful customers.  Most restaurants would have delivered the rice bowl and said, we noticed we forgot to charge you for the brown rice and that it is on the house today.  I wonder if this is a new directive from the ownership/management to extracts every dollar from their customers.  We will just have to see.Strike one and two Bento!!"
2/6/2009,4,"Same Bento Yumminess as Newberry Road, but a smidge bigger I would say.  MMMhmmm..."
3/24/2012,2,"The petty charges at Bento have become ridiculous. Overall, the food is decent, the atmosphere is trendy, and the service is hit or (more commonly) miss, but getting charged for every insignificant meal add on has just become tacky.The $0.50 charge for a small dipping cup of sauce is outrageous considering that every other Asian cuisine establishment will gladly give you spicy mayo and Sriracha for free, but the breaking point was during my most recent visit tonight. Upon examining my receipt I noticed that I was charged $0.20 for TAP WATER. Sure, a pretty insignificant amount, but never have I been to a restaurant that had the nerve to charge for tap water.I considered using the restroom before leaving the restaurant, but didn't want to run the risk of getting charged per square of toilet paper."
6/28/2011,4,The sushi is fantastic.  Always has been.  There service is good but sometimes I feel like all those pretty cashiers are more interested in talking to each other then they are getting the food out and servicing the guests.  Maybe it's just been my experience though.  The sushi is so good I'd probably still go back even if the service was horrible.
12/8/2011,2,This Bento location is probably ok as a student hangout but I'm not a student. I ordered the Katsu chicken. It comes garnished with broccoli I mean cold broccoli. The panko bread crumbed chicken was over cooked and served a slightly higher than room temperature. The rice was clumpy and cold.  What really bothers me is the Newberry road location has always been great. They even charge for extra sauces at this location. I'll leave this Bento for the students. I appreciate a more professional food experience. I won't be back to this location.
3/29/2013,4,The boxes are so cute! My favorite spontaneous late night dinner is a box with my beau and we sit outside (archer rd) so we can feed that cute cat outside! He LOVES fishies!
11/4/2011,4,"Good food and great prices! If you're looking true, authentic, traditional Asian food - this isn't your place. This is more of a place where you want pretty good Asian food that is NOT take out, but has a trendy, casual, fast food/sit down atmosphere.I love their Bento boxes and their noodle bowls! They have meat and non-meat options, sushi, appetizers, bubble teas, sodas, and beer. They aren't just Chinese, but have some Korean and Thai options as well.Some of my favorite dishes are the Bulgogi Beef Noodle Bowl and the Chicken Katsu Bento Box. I don't know what type of noodles they use in their noodle bowls.. but they are like thin udon/thick ramen style noodles are so yummy! I love their sauces too. I love their milk teas - taro and red bean are my favorite! My boyfriend loves the Spicy Tuna Don and the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box.My cousin used to work here and told me that they make their sauces from scratch everyday and that they use whole chickens to cut up into different pieces.I no longer live in Gainesville and I have never found a place quite like this. I definitely miss it and will have to visit when I am in town again!I believe that they have a separate section that you can reserve for special parties and occasions. You can always get take out or get it delivered through one of the local Gainesville food delivery companies. It is usually pretty busy at all times of the day, but you can usually find seating (or don't have to wait too long) and the food comes out pretty quickly. Good service from the cashiers and the servers who bring out your food after you order it. They are nice and helpful and bring out your utensils and napkins."
6/12/2011,3,"My teenagers love this place for the Chicken Katsu Bento Box. I always order the Philly Roll. It's pretty good for this kind of food. Great when you''re in the mood for something different but quick. The last time we were there, they were expanding it so that should be nice and much more comfortable although I never felt crowded. Sometimes the sushi is not rolled up as nicely (falls apart) and I suspect it's because it's Philly Roll and not something more exotic so that's their little passive-aggressive thing the sushi-rollers do but hey, that's ok. It's still tasty."
6/30/2013,4,I love Bento! It is my go-to guarantee for good sushi in Gainesville. It's very casual with an excellent environment. It's seriously awesome for just a quick pick up or a casual lunch/ dinner with friends. I especially am a HUGE fan for the Mexican rolls.. yuuuummmmmmmy!!!!
4/29/2014,1,"Horrible service. Unimpressive food. We came right before closing Sunday night and the guy/douchebag who took our order was not very courteous and loudly said "" you have 2 minutes to order ""! He had this pissed look in his ugly face because he appears to hate his job. My friend who was from out of town had some questions which the cashier was none too happy to acknowledge. Take your business somewhere else. Don't come here. Not worth your money."
5/5/2012,4,"My boss told me about this place so I had to check it. I was not disappointed! I got the Green Boba Tea with Black Pearls for a drink and the Pad Thai Noodle Bowl. The drink was yummy, sweet and the pearls added another sweetness I cannot describe but definitely a light refreshing drink. The bowl was huge and very very tasty! Lots of chicken, not too spicy and the noodles were done perfectly! I'm so glad there is a Bento up in Jacksonville so I can become a regular. Next time I'll definitely try the sushi."
3/20/2014,5,"Bento Cafe is an excellent place in Gainesville to stop if you're craving some sushi. Staff is very friendly, place has nice atmosphere and food is excellent."
3/15/2018,5,yes sometimes i want to cry how long the lines is but the food is so good that its worth the wait. takes long but sushi!!! learn to have patience anyways. best quick sushi in gville
4/2/2013,5,I love this place! There are so many options and everything is so reasonably priced! I get one rice bowl and it lasts me two full meals. They're decently quick but you can call ahead if you're in a pinch!
12/22/2010,2,"Service wasn't the best. The cashier girl was a ditz, she didn't even think to give us our ticket order to pick up our food later. The fish was not fresh. I had a stomach ache that night =X"
4/19/2013,4,I was out shopping on Archer and had a sushi craving. I knew this place was a chain but wanted to give it a try anyway. I played it safe and ordered the spicy tuna roll. It came out super fast and was quite tasty. The restaurant was packed yet they had a whole other area roped off people could have been sitting in since it is seat yourself. Next time I would order a box or bowl they looked really good.
9/25/2015,4,"Great sushi, I recommend the hot lava roll (shrimp tempura, white escolar, delicious crab meat on top). My favorite bento box is the spicy cream chicken. Four stars instead of five because sometimes the chicken is very heavily breaded and there will only be a little bit of chicken in the middle. The cream is very good, and the bento boxes are reasonably priced (come with rice, noodles, ginger salad, string beans, and a dessert)."
8/4/2012,3,"After reading 4 star reviews on Yelp I tried Bento Cafe for delivery. When I called I was told to google ""2 dollar delivery"" to place delivery orders. This was pretty easy and offered options to custom order the food. I wanted sake with my order but no alcohol could be ordered on the web site.The Chicken Thai Coconut Curry  (noodle bowl) was very bland, with overcooked noodles, that were just mush when eaten. A little salt and pepper would have been good, however there was a nice hint of coconut in the milk / cream style sauce. The ""Crunch Roll"" sounded good but barely any tuna or cream cheese in the roll, it was mostly the fake ""Krab"" and tasted like it. The Panco breading was a different approach than the usual Tempura and was pretty good as a breading. The green tea with pearls....not quite sure what the pearls are but they are like chewing a small black gummy bear. The green tea flavor itself, was quite good one of the better I have tasted.Disappointing after all the good reviews, but a little better than most places. A little more seasoning and not skimping on the tuna and cream cheese in the roll and this place would have got 4 stars, but just 3 for now."
8/16/2011,5,Donburis are the best and you really get your money's worth. I'm always stuffed when I eat those sushi or entree rice bowls! I miss being in Gainesville...
1/1/2013,1,"Yuck. This is the worst Asian food we have had since moving here.Unless you have NEVER had decent Asian food, skip this place or be prepared for disappointment. Besides the annoyingly slow ""pre-pay at the cashier"" type of service, they serve up terrible-tasting, overpriced food. The only thing that was just OK was the sushi rolls which tasted at least fresh. The Boba tea tasted like powdery paste (tried 2 different flavors to be sure it was really as awful as the first). The noodle bowls were watery and underseasoned, I have had better curry from a frozen packet at home. The ambiance is one of the worst parts of the experience here, unless you like blaring techno music and cheesy 1990's light-up booths with dirty tables."
7/17/2011,3,"The Thai tea with Pearls here is the only reason it will ever be acceptable for me to get off at the Gainesville exit. But, I have made a trip off the highway JUST because. Definitely worth a try if you're (unfortunately) local."
6/28/2011,4,"I love Bento because the prices are reasonable and everything tastes great! My favorite dishes are General Tsos Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Cream Chicken, Spicy Korean Chicken, and the Spicy Salmon Don! Boba tea is also yummy!"
7/7/2011,5,Amazing Asian food and the bobo tea is to die for my only complaint is there too close to work so I eat here too often.
8/3/2014,1,"The customer service at this restaurant is horrible. I called them to make a to go order and they had me on hold for 20 minutes. They didn't even put the phone on hold, they put the phone down so I was able to hear everything that was going on and no one acknowledged the fact that there was a phone sitting off the line. when someone finally answered they phone they didn't apologize for the hold so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was extremely rude and tried to explain that they are backed up but that doesn't give any excuse to put me on hold for that long. They could have at least had the decency to pick up the phone and keep me abreast of what's going on for why I'm waiting so long, or they could have told me when I called that it will be a long hold. They were not helpful at all. I ended up making an order with the Bento off of newberry."
8/11/2011,4,Love me some bentos. Great food great atmosphere. Only a 4 star because it is a chain.
2/26/2012,4,The prices where really good for the quantities you get. The sashimi was actually really fresh and tasty and the coconut Thai curry bento box I had was good too. The only thing I don't like is that you don't know what to do when you walk in. Sit? Order? Wait to be seated. A little vague.
12/12/2012,4,"Everyone in Gainesville knows this place! Its the best hang-out spot for college students. Food is affordable and great (most of the time), Parking might be harder to find during the weekends, you will just have to hunt."
9/4/2011,3,"Went for lunch on Wednesday.  I ordered the shrimp tempura. The wait was pretty long, especially since there were only two people ahead of me and only four tables/booths occupied. The decor is interesting...would probably start to bug me if I dined in. Anyway, finally got my to go order and took it back to work. When I opened the box, my heart dropped just a little. Why would they call it tempura when it was panko battered? Don't get me wrong now. They were cooked perfectly - for panko battered shrimp. It just wasn't tempura and that was what I was expecting. The green beans were yummy. Polished those off pretty quickly. The rice was too sticky for my taste. And I never did figure out what the little muffin was all about. Anyway, will go back again and try something different. Maybe I should have given them 4 stars instead. Let's call it 3.5 for this visit."
1/14/2013,4,"Great, quick sushi! I've never had a roll that I didn't like at Bento, and I've been going there for 5 years. Their noodle soups and bowls are also delicious. Plus, it won't break the bank - prices are pretty reasonable."
5/7/2011,4,This is actually a really good place for sushi in Gainesville. It is very reasonably priced for what you get. And they were playing great music when I was there.
7/30/2011,2,"Bento used to be my go-to place for fast sushi and sushi bowls...now its gotta be Bento Blue.  Bento Red is on Archer Rd, while Bento Blue is on Newberry.  I put off going to Blue because I wasn't a fan of their loud, abonoxious techno music...but their service is faster and friendlier.  Their sauces are all free (no up-charge).  They have daily specials! The parking lot wasn't completely full! But really, Bento Red still deserves a spot somewhere...prices are still decent. I'd drive the extra few miles for Blue."
12/7/2012,4,"The food is pretty good. It's a good place to go that is priced well and gives good portions. Their bentos and noodle bowls are both pretty good. It's not ""authentic"" but it  comes out quick and is good. The decor is well done to look trendy with a red and black theme. Good place to go to grab a bite with some friends."
9/27/2009,3,It is a little expensive for the quality. But I still like it. The noodle soup and bento is their best. My favorite is teriyaki bento box. Sushi is average.Don't forget try their pearl tea.!!strong recommend. The environment there is fine.
4/14/2015,4,"ate lunch here recently and the spicy tuna roll was really good, place was clean, service fast and food good, what more can u ask for?"
9/2/2011,5,I love the Bento box so much! The duck meat is great!
7/24/2012,4,"First, their food is delicious. Their sushi is comparable to if not better than sushi at far more expensive restaurants, and their Red Dragon roll is one of my favorite sushi rolls anywhere. The bento boxes are delicious, and their red curry is especially superb. (I recommend getting a bento box over a rice bowl or noodle bowl--I find both of those to always be a bit lackluster).  They have a great menu with very reasonable prices and they are vegetarian-friendly as well.So why only 4 stars? Though they've gotten better in the last year or so, the servers can be a bit snotty. I had a problem with an order and even the manager was not at all accommodating (long wait, wrong dish, etc). Still, as I say, it's gotten better if still not perfect.But the main reason they lose a star is all the charges for extras. Don't want soda? You have to pay for a water cup. Your food comes with spicy sauce but you want a little more? That'll be 50 cents, please.  Substitutions? There will be a charge.  They enforce these vigorously too--they will run your credit card for a quarter. Their food prices are reasonable, but it's very tiring to be nickel-and-dimed on any extras, especially if you just want to try something. The other Gainesville location on Newberry Road does not charge for these extras."
12/24/2014,2,"I love Bento but this particular one is not a good location.  I am not a picky customer and am usually happy with just about anything, but my food has been awful every time I've visited,the last time I ordered a rice bowl and it was extremely salty and was all rice and just a few pieces of meat or veggies.  At the Bento's on Newberry Road it's done right and more balanced.   Bento concept is great but this particular one falls short in execution."
1/11/2014,4,"""Bento Red,"" as they call this location, might be a little bit better than the original ""Bento Blue."" I do not visit this location nearly as often, but when I do, it's usually a better experience. At Bento Red, the restaurant is a lot bigger, so the staff provides you with a number to sit on your table so they know where to bring your food (rather than at Bento Blue, where they just seem to be good at paying attention to your face, but I don't know if that's really how they do it!) Whenever I go here, it's usually pretty busy, but not so much that it takes longer to wait for my food than it does to enjoy it. The food here seems to be a lot more fresh and consistent than at Blue, and the menu is a little bigger with a bit more variety as well (mostly, they have some desserts!) The biggest advantage of Bento Red is its location; it's right on Archer Road and in the same strip as Mochi and Hiro, where you have even more delicious dessert options."
5/28/2011,4,"I really like this restaurant!!! I love the yellow curry rice bowl, the bento boxes are kind of bad.... I also love the boba teas because the pearls in them are genius! I also love to get the Dragon Roll sushi roll! overall a great restaurant!!!"
9/19/2012,4,"Great sushi spot. Bubble tea was pretty good for trying it my first time as well. Took my girlfriend here for lunch one day, loved the ""Bento Box"" and will definitely be back for the good food and service."
2/27/2014,3,"The sushi is great, but don't get the spicy cream noodle bowl. Whether it be chicken or shrimp it's upset my stomach both times.  When I had the chicken I assumed it was just less than satisfactory meat. However, I just gave it a second chance and I feel even more sick than I did last time."
3/18/2011,4,"This review is probably most helpful for non-sushi eaters, since I don't eat sushi and know nothing about the sushi here... but I hear it's good. Anyways, the bento rice bowls are very good. I usually get the teriyaki beef or chicken, which is much better than most places. The rice bowls come with string beans, which are very good and crispy. These bowls are huge, and WILL fill you up. Don't get the boba tea here though, it's not good and there are better places. The parking for the restaurant really sucks, and if it's packed, it is such a hassle to find parking. I do love how it's located next to mochi's though, so dessert is already figured out. There aren't many seats available sometimes, but I hear they're expanding (and they might have already expanded...) And it's nice to order and sit down at a table, and have them bring the food to you. One last note, the line usually seems long but goes very fast, so don't get intimidated or annoyed by the appearance of the line."
9/16/2011,5,"i LOVE this place. great food and good prices. you can pretty much order anything you can think of. usually busy, but totally worth the line. i think we end up going at least once a week. my favorite are the rice bowls, but they have noddle bowls, bento boxes, sushi, basically everything. the PERFECT college dinner night"
9/25/2013,2,"Not family friendly. There are no changing tables in the mens or womens bathrooms. The food quality has gone down hill, the chicken was dried out and old looking defiantly not fresh."
5/14/2012,4,Great simple fresh food.  Enjoyed a bento and boba tea.  Easy access from 75.
10/23/2012,4,"Great prices are what always draw me back. I usually order a Bento box, and it's almost always the Spicy Cream chicken (so good!). The box has a good variety of veggies, noodles, rice, and meat, and is reasonably priced."
6/3/2013,1,Very poor customer service. Would not recommend at all. A bunch of college kids running the place like a frat house.
4/25/2013,1,Bentos is made for those without taste buds.  It is like Dragonfly but for those who can't afford as much.  It is extremely disappointing.  I ordered a curry chicken and it tasted like a chicken with Chinese vegetables with curry powder mixed in.  I have never had curry chicken without a curry sauce.  It is always crowded with people who just want to be seen and have the taste buds of bottom suckers.  Its awful.
3/22/2010,1,After a few times there and being 100% unsatisfied...I am officially never going back. Other options in Gainesville that blow this place out of the water. I don't know what people see in this place....
1/23/2022,5,"I did it - I ordered via Bentos Cafe's mobile App and carried it out with no wait time. (The App told me it would be ready in 30mins, but I arrived within 15mins, and it was coming out of the kitchen.)I've been to Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi on Newberry Road many times. Appetizing fast pan-Asian food with a good variety for vegetarians, sushi-lovers, or meat-lovers alike. I like that this location has plenty of outdoor seating. But on these raining cold days, I wanted to stay in, too lazy to cook, and I wanted easy to order. I enjoyed a classic, a Rice Bowl with chicken at the comforts of my home, and the price and portions were plentiful. Don't forget to ask for sauce! Based on experience, you must ask for them to get some."
12/15/2021,3,"Early dinner after Gator game, was trying to decide on something quick and fairly healthy.Decided in build a poke bowl since there would be options for some raw veggies.Got teriyaki, salmon, avocado, onions , diced mangos, mushrooms and kimchi over a bed of rice.Overall the meal was good, just the mango and salmon was a little old definitely hindered the experience.Will drop back again next time in town!"
7/27/2021,2,"I used to be the biggest Bento fan (OGs will remember spicy cream chicken, #TBT) but it seems like it has gone downhill recently. This store is honestly THE WORST for takeout orders (I'm talking Uber Eats, online orders for pickup, all of those). I recently had two orders in a row where I ordered online and went in store to pick it up and had to wait 20+ minutes past my wait time. One of those times the young lady immediately told me that it was because they gave my pick-up order to an Uber Eats driver by mistake, but they didn't put in a remake of my order until I arrived at my pick-up time...?! Anyway, I digress. I ate in the restaurant last night and the staff was friendly. I was a bit shocked at how expensive it has gotten ($45 for two chicken noodle bowls and two boba slushes??). We were not at all impressed with the honey boba, which we were super excited to try, but the strawberry slush with strawberry popping boba was good.The Pao Pao chicken is the only reason I still come here, honestly. It's good. My fiance had the teriyaki chicken and it was just okay - it was gristly and he had a few pieces with little shards of bone that he had to spit out. Our noodles (udon, lo mein) were okay. The little green beans are so good. They run some good specials (BOGO Boba and $3 off teriyaki rice bowls on Tuesdays, sometimes other specials via email) where the food is worth it, otherwise, it's just 'meh' at full price. I reached out to Bento on Instagram and Facebook to find out if these specials were still live (as to not clog the phone lines for people placing orders) and never got a response, but they do have a sign in the restaurant on Newberry road showing that they are. Overall - we were disappointed.Update: Was asked by a business employee to reach out via email, emailed on 8/12, and still haven't heard back."
1/15/2022,5,"Bento is my go to for good, reasonably priced sushi. The service is okay, nothing special but it isn't bad either. I always get the sushi combo box, which features your choice of two 4-piece sushi rolls from a list and an 8-piece California roll. I get the special Mexican as my two 4-piece rolls and usually pair it with the spicy Mayo. It's always delicious every single time!! The shrimp on top of the special mex is my favorite! I love to sit outside in a sunny day and soak in the rays while enjoying my sushi. I'll forever be a customer of Bento!!"
4/6/2022,1,Zero stars. My chicken was literally raw. Hoping I don't get food poisoning. Quality has plummeted.
8/7/2019,5,"I'm a little obsessed. But why not? They're convenient and there's outdoor seating and if I'm feeling cash strapped there are entire meals I can get for $6-$8 (kids' chicken katsu box or the mini poke bowl--including the really flavorful and tender Asian Cajun Steak option!) Another fave of mine is the bamboo roll, which is pretty satisfying bc it has fried elements.I just love coming here for a raw fish fix or to curl up with a book and zone.Don't really know what else to say but check out the pictures."
7/28/2021,2,"Cashier girl had an attitude since we came in and expected just friendly service and maybe recommendations since we aren't familiar with menu. Apart from sad service which I see from other reviews as well , sushi was chewy and not the good kind.. hard to swallow."
11/11/2019,3,"We stopped in for a few appetizers to hold us over while we waited for a table at a nearby restaurant. Quick takeout place with at least 10 tables inside and quite a few tables on the patio area. A few of the tables needed to be cleaned off but overall the place was clean.We ordered spring rolls, egg rolls, fried dumplings and two beers. We had to eat inside because alcohol is not allowed on the patio. Food was brought to our table rather quickly. I did notice many people around us ordering noodle bowls and they looked good. Next time we are in town I will try it out."
7/23/2021,1,What happen to this place??!! It used to be such a fun spot to get a quick bite and great boba. Now it's just sad and dirty.
6/18/2018,3,"Bento, bento, bento. That's all any college kid talks about so I decided to stop by and check out the hype.I came here on national sushi day and expected the place to be crowded since they were giving out your choice of a free Mexican roll, Tempura roll, or a chicken roll. (Need to be subscribed to email list)I ordered the Mexican roll, Rainbow roll and two milk slushies. The roll was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Same with the rainbow roll. Very average.The ""Dream"" which is a mixture of a coconut and taro was very diluted and tasted like an original milk tea.The basic taro slushy on the other hand was delicious. I would definitely come back for it. If you like taro you'll like this slushy. The taste of taro is very strong.Customer service is excellent. I was considering giving this place a 4/5 just because of that aspect but the food was too average to justify. 3.5/5P.s. I have noticed Bento has a lot of deals throughout the year. If you want to stay in the loop I advise you to subscribe to their newsletter or follow them on Facebook."
8/21/2021,2,This place is the worst bento I had.The crunch roll was just rice and little bit of amount the tuna. Interesting is tuna still have the skin on it. Sushi chef like beginner.
1/24/2022,2,The ability to think outside the box from employees at this location is lacking. Asked for brown rice in my bowl (which they have) and was told they couldn't do it in the bowls. So they gave me the bowl with no rice and a side of brown rice while charging me over $17 for the order. Cashier was also extremely rude. Will go to the other (better) bowl place in town next time...yes it's Bolay!
6/25/2021,1,My phone has a small issue where it sounds like I'm talking on speaker phone even when I am not. Called in to make an order and got hung up on because they said i was on speaker phone. How hard can it be to take an order through the phone? I know it doesn't sound perfectly but I speak with people everyday and have never had issues with them not understanding what I'm saying because there is a small imperfection with the sound of my voice.  Called the other Bentos location and made an order without an issue.
5/27/2021,3,"Bento's used to be a local pan Asian sushi place with consistency and quality. The quality, consistency, and value have all deteriorated in the last several years or maybe my tastes have changed."
11/28/2019,5,"Bento is one of my favorite restaurants in Gainesville. On my most recent trip, I ordered the Spicy Cream chicken (which I think is their most popular sauce) with lo mein and it was so good. My friend had the the tofu with orange sauce and udon which she thought was a tad bit too sweet since tofu and udon both just taste like whatever sauce you put them with, but she still really liked her meal. We both had enough leftovers for a second meal. At bento, you can pick to have a rice bowl (white or brown) with your choice of chicken, tofu, steak, and shrimp and any of their sauces. You can also have a noodle bowl with either lo mein, udon, or ramen or a bento box. I always choose the noodle bowl and I'm always satisfied. You can also order sushi from here and I've heard it's really good but I have never tried it. I probably will soon though!"
4/27/2021,1,"I have tried to eat here several times due to it's convenient location. I have never had a good experience here. The food is either incorrectly prepared (completely different from what I ordered) or the employees who take the orders are extremely condescending when asked simple questions. I won't be returning, and I will be telling everyone I know not to frequent the establishment either."
9/8/2020,2,"So disappointed..asked for food to be a little spicer..it was so hot it was inedible..no one will answerWhat a joke! Couldn't even eat because it taste awful..I like hot food but this was almost intentionally terrible..won't be going back.Last time it was subpar and this time it's a waste of money.Tried to call them three times and I get no answer.I guess a review is necessary since I can't give them the opportunity to fix the issue.Normally,I would give a business the chance to make it right but how can I?"
10/5/2021,2,"So, I used to love Bento. I've been a fan for years, but here lately it's definitely not the same. Not only have the prices gone up significantly, but the quality has gone down. I'm pretty positive the white sauce is store bought now, or at least it was tonight (it's awful). The food is still good, but it's definitely not worth it when the prices increase every couple of months and you don't get the old school bento you're craving. Guess I'll be making my own bento, since that's much cheaper and they use store bought stuff you can get at Publix anyway"
10/4/2018,5,"Ugh. Bento will forever hold my heart. The cream puffs are to die for and the service is always enjoyable. This is similar to a Panera where you order up at a counter and your food is brought to you shortly after. The lunch rush can be busy but trust me, the line goes by quickly! I've also been known to order sushi to-go and bring it to the theater next door or grab some Coldstone as dessert after. The location is great and so is the food!"
11/11/2020,1,"They are the Taco Bell of Asian food, the food was quite flavorless except for my chicken all 3 of us were very unsatisfied and ended up going to another restaurant to eat. The sushi rolls my daughter ordered were very small. The only plus to the place was they actually made people wait outside to get there to go orders and only allowed one customer in at a time requiring a mask be worn. The cheap ramen noodle soups you get at any grocery store has better flavor then what you will get here."
11/21/2017,1,"Disclaimer: LOVE the Bento Cafe on Archer Rd- been going to that location since 2009 and they definitely taste better.Came to this one on Newberry for the first time a couple weeks ago. Ordered my usual Red Curry white rice bowl. 1. Took way too long. Over the phone, the lady said it would be 15-20 mins but it ended up being about 25-27 mins till I got my order.2. They have other locations but the chefs seem to be different at each one... cause the Red Curry I got here was completely off compared to the other places. More veggies than meat and the curry wasnt spicy at all, didn't taste much like anything in my opinion.3. Its a lot smaller of a restaurant, inside a huge plaza, and far down from the highway exit."
12/7/2020,2,"My gf and I went to this location just to get a Thai tea and a slush/smoothie honeydew milk tea with boba. The entire time we were waiting this dude that had DoorDashed had been waiting for a while and quite patiently. After several times of coming back in to check 5-10 min intervals, he was waiting outside and the staff was snickering and quite dismissive of him to the point that he straight up left. Like 2 mins after he left we received our drinks. They gave me an iced honeydew milk tea instead of a smoothie/slush. After seeing what we had seen we decided to just leave it because to be honest this isn't the first time something has happened with bento. Food is decent but wait and service can be crap. Typically we door dash bento if we get it so as to not deal with this type of issue."
11/27/2017,4,"This is the original Bento Cafe location. It is significantly smaller than the one on Archer Road. It is quick service Asian food. They have rice bowls, noodle bowls, poke bowls, bento boxes, and sushi rolls. You can choose from chicken, beef, pork, and tofu as a protein. The kitchen entrees are a good size, but the sushi rolls are not filling in my opinion. Price is typically $10+."
6/9/2021,1,I used to love Bento but the service and quality of food has dropped severely. I ordered a chicken and shrimp pao pao bowl. There was so much sauce it made the noodles under it soggy. They offered to remake it but I had already had 2 full spoons of sauce/soup and had lost my appetite. Never again.
6/10/2017,5,"Never fails to make me smile! I've been coming here for over ten years and the food is always so fresh! I love the Red Dragon without cream cheese, salmon sashimi, and udon noodles. Hubby loves the Spicy Cream with shrimp and mini udon. My vegan kid loves the fried avocado roll, the veggie delight without cream cheese, and a side of plain udon. Top it off with a Lychee Boba and my tummy is happy!"
9/25/2017,1,"Avoid this Bento (Newberry Rd) location if you can. This is the second time I've had a bad experience. My first bad experience involved the manager. We had almost a 45 min wait for our food and the sushi was cold by the time we got it. Ate maybe 3 pieces of sushi & decided we wanted a refund instead because we had already waited & now have to find another place to eat. The manager stated she could only give a gift card for a return visit. I stated we paid cash, and that is what she must give back. Based on this experience I wouldn't be returning for another visit and I wanted my cash back. After going back & forth with me, she went to the register, stormed back to us and slammed the cash on our table saying ""Just so you know we're not supposed to give cash out of the drawer!""I hadn't been back there in maybe 2 years, until now (which wasn't my choice). My coworkers & I ordered Bento via Bite Delivery last Tuesday. We have always used $2 delivery but apparently it's now merged with Bite. The Archer Bento location was always available on $2delivery, but for some strange reason only Newberry was available on Bite. Since my coworkers were ordering, and it was my only option for food so I went ahead and ordered. I got a Spicy Cream rice bowl & a Mt. Fuji Sushi Bento box. I was pissed after eating my sushi because the sushi rice was not cooked all the way. It tasted horrible and was falling apart when I picked up with chopsticks. Luckily I ordered the rice bowl, because it was cooked fine and I didn't have to starve for the night. I reached out on their contact form & still have not heard back from Bento. I'm extremely unsatisfied with the service & food I received. Spent $20 on food & had to throw half of it away."
5/2/2020,5,I love bento for portion control!  Its ok food and nothing actually delicious but everything is at that Chilis level.
10/8/2017,3,"I ordered the rainbow roll and tasted pretty average. I was surprised because multiple people raved about how great Bento is. The sushi roll was also made very sloppy. Every piece had a different thickness, height, and fish to rice ratio. I also ordered the blended taro milk tea. It was refreshing but incredibly sweet so I was able to share it with someone. Although the restaurant did not meet my expectations I will go back and try something different."
5/18/2019,4,Love Bento  cafe here in newberry road. I usually here for late lunch because not busy. Good food as always. Clean and friendly. I got a bento box takeout this afternoon. Pow pow chicken is always good
9/11/2016,1,"Ok first of all, I have to put a disclaimer in here: I have been coming to Bentos for 9+ years. I've spent undoubtedly hundreds if not thousands of dollars here throughout the years. In college I ate here at least once a week, usually twice. What I saw today made me want to NEVER come back.My sister and I sit down at the table and I turn around and there is a LIVE cockroach on the wall behind me. A big one. I grab a girl bussing tables and tell her, and she was really sweet but terrified of roaches too so wanted to grab a guy busser to take care of it. Ok, fast forward 20 minutes later....no exaggeration. the thing is STILL moving on the wall and as this is the only table left in the restaurant we are still standing there waiting for it to be taken care of. My sister gets fed up and KILLS IT HERSELF. Because that's totally acceptable as a paying customer to be forced into no other option but killing a living cockroach themselves....The servers avoided us like we had the plague. No one EVER came to clean it up. It was still there when we left. For all they knew it was still alive. How comforting..... On the way out was the cherry on top of the whole experience. There was a second cockroach near the exit.  Don't worry, I'm attaching pictures so you can know that I'm not making this disgusting ish up."
1/27/2019,5,"I LOVE IT! this is the best place to eat, no doubt. The food is amazing, service is great, overall an amazing experience. I ordered the Poke Bowl with shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, nori and Sesame seeds. My new favorite place to eat."
4/11/2019,5,"I have always enjoyed Bento whether its dine-in or carry-out.  All locations are great, same level of service, same quality of food and great atmosphere.  I really like the Bento Box options but also love their sushi rolls."
7/7/2020,4,"Super yummy! Love the sushi and the service was pretty fast. I also am a big fan of the restaurant vibe. Very pretty area, I hope to one day come back down this way. Definitely would recommend this for dinner some night."
2/20/2018,1,"My beloved Bentos has really gone down the tubes. Maybe they're expanding too quickly and not bothering to maintain the standards they once had. This use to be the one place I would eat at ALL THE TIME. This last trip was beyond aggravating. I called to place a to go order. The phone rang FOREVER. I checked the number, checked the website, called again. Same thing. I called the Archer location to ask if the Newberry location was still open and double checked the number with her. Called again. Finally someone answered and I can't say she was delightful or pleasant to talk to. She asked to put me on hold. In the time it took for me to call a few times, get put on hold, and for her to come back on the line I had already driven, in traffic, clear across town and was in the freaking parking lot. By the time I got to give my order, I was quoted a 30 minute wait for my food. It's a shame because this place was awesome but based on this last trip, it's another restaurant in town that's gone down significantly and is catering to a college student crowd and service is no longer a priority. I never thought I'd say it, but I'd give this place a big old skip."
3/8/2021,1,"I've lived in Gainesville all my life and loved bentos still do an I'm not one to judge but I'm not stupid either an it seems most of the staff here just barely made it in from a hell of a weekend there sunken in eyes scream ""I can't wait for my next hit of coke"" sad to see one of gville gems in the gutter w the rest of it"
4/3/2020,1,"Submitted an order for 9 hard working employees. Placing the order was a nightmare and they cancelled the order 10 min before we were supposed to pick it up. No call, no follow up. Never again"
11/7/2019,5,all the workers are so cute i actually cried while eating :) kaylan is the sweetest love her she fixed the drinks and gave us yum yum sauce (it's yummy)
2/17/2021,1,Placed order paid extra for 3 different sauces they did not deliver them . The chicken was hard as a rock and was horrible. The crab wontons we ordered were also hard as a rock. Called Bento they said they put all stuff in the bag and the driver must have stolen it. NEVER AGAIN!!!
9/28/2020,5,"I can honestly say the food here was not disappointing! I personally really enjoy orange chicken and the orange chicken was most likely the best I have ever had! the white rice and vegetables it came with could not have been better. I was quite amazed of how they made white rice taste so good but they did it! It did not take long for the food to come out and it was at the perfect temperature, ready to eat! Due to COVID they had every other space closed off which I found so comforting and I saw a worker cleaning the spaces with great detail! They were very kind to take my order and made sure that they were giving me the best experience! Even with the mask on they seemed like they were still giving great, big smiles! The prices were so convenient, and they give you an abundance of food for the price of 10$. I can't wait for my next visit when I want to treat myself, or my friends to a delicious dinner."
8/17/2018,5,"I have been coming here once a week for the past ten years so I may be biased but this is my go to restaurant in Gainesville. I usually get the spicy salmon don (bowl) because it's the best but you also can't go wrong with some of their bento box options. I would recommend their spicy cream chicken, and if you don't like spicy, you can always go teriyaki. Bento is fast, convenient, and above all consistent in providing a good quality meal at a reasonable price."
10/6/2018,4,"I remember the good ol' days when you could get as much delicious white sauce as you needed to finish off your rice bowl. Now they charge above 1 dinky little spoonful.Maybe I'm just old but I miss that version of Bentos. Ate here probably 2-3 times a week in undergrad and invited everyone I knew because the food is THAT good. A little more expensive than when I was here two years ago and the servers kept forgetting to give us napkins and utensils. But, the food... still worth it."
3/23/2018,4,"My daughter has been eating Bentos sushi for years, but once I had their Pad Thai I've been sold. It's delicious and has become almost the only thing I order. I've also had their General Tao, and it's by far the best I've ever had as well. Not giving them 5 stars cause they consistently messed up large party orders, and they can be very slow. Best to go there early before the rush."
6/25/2019,2,"I've always come or picked up food from Bento on Newberry. However this last time really turned me off to this location. I ordered a poke bowl with onions and avocado and the order was made incorrectly. Instead of onions I was given edamame, my worst enemy. When I called the person spoke to told me if I went they'd give a new bowl so I quickly got in my car and went to pick up the bowl that was supposed to be ready. When I got there I was greeted by a not so friendly staff who would only give me chopped red onions. I have red onions at home, I would've chopped them myself and saved myself the trip. I really hope they get some new management or some hospitality training. What was meant to be a relaxing after work dinner turned into an embarrassing mess and a waste of gas."
3/11/2018,1,"I was given undercooked chicken and they messed up my order! I've eaten at Bento for years, but after last night I will never be going back. I ordered two seasame chicken rice bowls through the Bite Squad delivery service from Bentos. When they delivered my order it was missing one bowl because Bento did not pack the order correctly (this was not Bite squads fault) then as I started to eat the one bowl given to me I noticed a piece of chicken was still raw in the center. I called Bento to complain and they were extremely rude about the situation and didn't want to do anything about it since they were closing in 10 minutes. I spoke to the manager and they said there was nothing they could do because I ordered through a service. (I did get a refund from Bite Squad after this) Even though Bento wasn't able to refund me I expected them to at least apologize for serving me undercooked chicken and practice good customer service by trying to correct the situation on their end a little bit. It was their fault after all and all I got from them was attitude. This isn't the first time I've experienced rude customer service at Bentos. The location on Archer Road in Gainesville was rude when I complained about having multiple hairs wind up in my bowl. So if you don't like hair in your food or having salmonella from consuming raw chicken followed by rude management I wouldn't suggest going here.  See attached photos of undercooked chicken"
6/11/2018,3,"Near UF. Affordable priced so many students come and take out poke bowls or sushi. They also have cooked hot dishes for you to choose and grab to go. Sometimes may have a long line maybe due toShort in staffing. Great poke dishes ( tuna , salmon and mixed)"
2/14/2018,5,"First time here and sucks we are moving in a few months because their food was boss! Heard some folks speak about this place while getting my car serviced. Came here for our Valentine dinner because I have 2 cute dates. We arrived just at 1700 and glad we came when we did, the flood of people that arrived after us was wow! Just etched in my mind that this was going to have some good food. There were several Bite Squad guys too. I'm not sure if this is the norm or just due to the ""Hallmark"" holiday. My son had the sweet/sour chicken kid's box which came with about 4-5 pieces of chicken, lo mein or rice, green beans and these little iced chips. His meal was free bc the deal they had was an adult bento box would give a child's box free. My mom had the teriyaki chicken bento box (in photos) & was amazed at how much grilled chicken that came with the meal plus how tender and juicy it was. She loved all that was on the box. My daughter and I had sushi. She did the sushi box which she ordered the Mexican roll x2 & it came with the Cali roll, salad, & some shredded green stuff. Her sushi box is my check-in photo. I had the hot lava and flying dragon minus avocado (yuck). I didn't see prices for drinks, only the special teas so water it is.  Some Sushi rolls come in 4 or 8 pieces ie ones my daughter ordered but mine were 8 pieces each. Also it can be quite loud inside so if they are busy and it's nice weather, sit outside. We'll return before we leave."
4/13/2017,4,"Bento is your typical Asian Fusion type restaurant and I frequent here to get their Pad Thai or most importantly, the Chicken Curry Katsu (with red curry of course)!I usually get the rice bowl with my Chicken Curry Katsu, which comes with some bak choy or green beans - but the best part is the sauce. It is a little spicy but very flavorful when used as a dipping sauce for the chicken and poured onto the rice. I have also tried it in the Bento Box form, which comes with little portions of green beans, a little dessert, noodles and salad. I prefer getting it with rice because I don't think the Bento Box is worth the extra dollars if you're super hungry because you don't get as much chicken!The Pad Thai here is not the best I have tried, but it is pretty good. There are red peppers in this dish and it is a little spicy compared to other sweet types of Pad Thai that I have tried elsewhere. When ordering this, I usually get the noodle bowl because it is the best option.On the weekends, this place is super crowded and the line will be wrapped around so make sure to call in your order (even if you want to dine-in). It will save you time!"
8/23/2019,1,"Looking for sushi this is not the place if sushi rolls are your thing this is still not the place. We found this place from yelp decided to try got there around 9pm you wait in line to place your order the staff was short and rude,the place was dirty. When our food arrived at the table the sushi was at room temperature the miso soup was not good it was very grainy I could go on but I think this is enough to say won't make this my go to place for sushi"
8/25/2019,2,"Poor service, wet mop smell, sticky floors, dirty tables, average rice bowl = not worth it."
4/14/2009,5,"I have been craving their Almond Joy Boba Milk Tea endlessly for months since the last time I came here. I surely got my fix this time -- a LARGE serving of it! My craving will be satisfied for the next few months.... =) Yes, I can get others to imitate it, but there's nothing like the original. A holy trinity of flavors (coconut, chocolate, and almond) mixed evenly into a milk tea treat mixed with tapioca pearls.By the way, they don't have ramen here. I asked. =("
10/28/2019,5,I love Bento! Good amount of food for the price you are paying and every meal I have tried there I enjoyed. I recommend highly.
1/4/2015,3,"Made a quick stop for dinner on the way back from Disney on a Monday night at 6pm. You take a menu at the entrance and order at the counter before sitting down at either an indoor or outdoor table.FOOD:- Mongolian Beef Bento Box: the Mongolian Beef was very salty. It's as if it was sitting out in a buffet line. I would say the same for the Lo Mein. As if it was sitting for a while. - Sushi combo box: For my sushi combo box, I choose the Florida roll, Spicy UF roll, & California roll. I thought they were all just okay.- We also ordered two bubble teas: Mango green tea with mango jelly & Milk tea with boba. These were okay. Not as great as the bubble tea stores that you find in Atlanta. Overall, I do not see myself returning to this location's Bento Cafe. Everything was mediocre. I know there are several sister Bento Cafe's in Florida that I would like to visit."
4/29/2019,5,"I have never had a bad experience here, bento is perfect. The only thing I don't like is how they fry their sushi. I think when it's fried it tastes cheap. The wait time is long but worth it. The edamame is also very tasty and seasoned well and the dumplings are HUGE."
9/26/2019,5,"Spicy creamy chicken with udon noodles or rice is soooooooooo good. Once in a while they'll burn something then cook your food in the burned oil so it tastes burned, but normally it's the best!!!"
2/15/2019,2,"Very disappointed to find several pieces of chicken in my tofu bowl. I'm giving one star because my boyfriend enjoyed his food and because this is out of character for Bento, I normally love it. Very sad."
9/12/2020,2,The service absolutely sucks !!! Two times during this pick up only I waited for 30 minutes after calling in my order only to find out it was on the pick up table the entire time !!! And no a free tea does not make it all better !!!
5/24/2018,1,"I've been sick for a week after having dinner here,Three consecutive days with a headache, body ache,sore throat and fatigue.How much MSG is in their food??!!!"
8/8/2016,4,"Can't wait for Bentos to open up in Tallahassee! Their menu is massive, and everything is cheap and enticing. They have one menu with hot foods including bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, soups, and appetizers. The other menu lists their sushi rolls and sashimi, as well as sashimi bowls and the new poké bowls. My indecisive self was overwhelmed, to say the least. After much contemplation I decided to split a flying dragon roll and poké bowl, although all of the hot options did sound amazing as well. The flying dragon roll had tempura shrimp, krab, avocado, Japanese mayo, topped with eel, masago, and eel sauce. The tastes all came together very well to create a delicious sushi roll. What stole the show though was the poké bowl. This choice was recently added to their menu and after hearing much hype I was very excited to try one! For the poké bowl, you build your own, choosing one, two, or three proteins (50 cent up-charge as add more protein). You then choose three mix ins and two sauces. You can make your bowl as healthy or as unhealthy as you like depending on the protein and toppings you choose. Everything I had was extremely fresh and tasty. I would suggest trying the tuna poké as your protein in the poké bowl, the marinade added a great flavor to the tuna. My friends all ordered bento boxes that looked great, and came with a ton of food! I'll have to try one myself next time and write an update. The quality of food for the low price is phenomenal. This will be my new go-to spot for quick and yummy food once they open in Tallahassee."
2/11/2009,5,"My friend and I came here yesterday when I came up to take a vacation in Gainesville and I have to see I was extremely impressed with this place. The menu is so diverse, it's pretty to find Korean, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian cuisines all perfectly combined on a menu, and I pretty much decided to go in all different directions in my ordered.I ordered a bulgogi steak bento box with a thai tea boba and also ordered a California Roll and Eel Roll.  The order was out in only a matter of minutes. The bento box was delicious and perfectly filling, I think the bulgogi at Sa Ri One in Tampa was a little better, but that doesn't mean this bulgogi tasted bad at all, it was quite delicious. The thai tea was perfectly made, not too much ice and strong flavor with very sweet and tender boba balls that didn't freeze up like I've had happen to me at some other places that I order thai tea at with boba.The sushi tasted very fresh, the crab in the California Roll was great, and the Eel Roll tasted good as well, it didn't have it's normal overpowering taste though so  I won't say it is the best sushi I have had, but it was pretty good and certainly worth it. The establishment is very nicely set up, appearing as a relaxing place with couches and a cool vibe to it, they even had the Initial D anime on two of their televisions, which I found to be pretty cool. I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in Gainesville."
8/22/2017,4,I love bento cafe. The service is usually great and very friendly atmosphere! The food is absolutely delicious although I've gotten my order mixed up a few times they have always been more than willing to fix it without hesitation. I recommend!!!
4/24/2018,4,"Last night I had my first trip to Bento Cafe.  I know I have been here for over a year and this was just my first time... What?   But I went in and thought I would give a new place a try.  I am sad that this was just my first time as everything was great.  I went in on a Monday night and visited the Newberry Rd location.  For being a Monday night I was surprised on how busy this place was.  I decided to order a Bento Box and then also got a Sushi box as well.  I have to say for a Bento Box it is not a ton of food for the money, but I was okay with it because it tasted amazing.  The Bento box comes with a protein your choice of chicken, steak and a few others, rice, ginger salad, lo mein, and green beans.  When you choose your protein you choose how you want it prepared.  I got it as Orange chicken and it tasted wonderful.  The chicken was by far my favorite thing.  They use big chunks of white meat chicken and the sauce was awesome.  I also tried the sushi and this was really good sushi.  The sushi chefs were working really fast since they had a ton of orders.  The sushi was fresh and had great tastes.  I tried the California Roll, Rainbow Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll.  All three had a lot of fresh flavor and tasted great.  Only concern I would have was the customer service of the girl who was working last night.  She had a key around her arm so I would assume she was the manager.  She called out the name to get the food.  All she did was put the food down and did not say thank you, or have a great day. I asked for some extra soy sauce, she reached in grabbed a handful and tossed it in the bag kinda rudely.  But overall I enjoyed my first time and will for sure be going back to try more menu items!!"
12/6/2016,4,"Bento Cafe is so good!  There are two locations in Gainesville (on two of the most populated roads) and this is my preferred location.  The lighting and atmosphere is awesome, it looks Oriental and trendy inside with some outside seating available as well.  You order in line instead of having a waitress.  In my experience, I usually end up waiting quite a while in line, but I don't mind because the food is so good!  I highly recommend the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl, it's the best!  The noodles are not fried and have an amazing flavor.  The bento boxes are good as well.  And they have takeout!!  Can't go wrong at Bento."
4/3/2017,5,I love this Bento! Always has great service and is relatively quick. The people are friendly too! My favorite is the Red Curry Tofu bowl with brown rice.
11/10/2016,5,"Delicious!! The place was crowded- and I can see why! The food was so fresh and delicious. I had the Korean tofu, it was SO flavorful. My two teenage kids had the orange chicken and the bulgogi-  and raved about it. The service was friendly and quick. Looking forward to going here again"
3/1/2019,2,The McDonald's of sushi but with worse service. They consistently leave ingredients out of the rolls that are described in the menu and the staff is usually annoyed with your existence.
12/26/2015,4,"Also known as ""Bento Blue"" I find this one to be somewhat better then the archer road location in town,  when busy, like both locations the line can take quite a while just to place your order. I do like that when they offer 1 free sauce per sushi roll ordered (i.e. Eel sauce, spicy mayo, etc) before they were additional .50 each. At first Bento can be a little overwhelming to the new first timer. Having to look through and hold 2 separate menus front and back till you decide what you want quickly and remember so you can tell the counter person. Once you have it down pat your in good hands. The staff is very efficient on getting your orders correct and out to the guests, for the most part the customer service is on point!The sushi has always been great! Very fresh! And the food prepared in the back of house also very good!  **TIP** if your a fan of tofu they have great bento boxes with tofu, personally I would suggest the SILKEN TOFU which you have to specifically ask for otherwise they will give you a harder more spongy version. My favorite is the Thai coconut curry bento box with silken tofu.  You won't be disappointed. Bento serves Coke products with the touchscreen soda machine with free refills. Gainesville definitely has a big following for Bento and they have been doing it right. I definitely recommend this restaurant for you to try for a not so quick service Panera style restaurant. Enjoy!"
6/16/2017,5,Delicious popular Asian foods in a nice friendly setting. Service is fast. Prices are right. The food is better prepared than the other Bento on Archer Road.
7/29/2016,4,"Bento is a Gainesville staple. If you don't know Bento, then you probably haven't lived in Gainesville very long.  I personally prefer the Bento red location on Archer road but I have ate at this one (blue) on Newberry too many times to count so I thought it was only fair to review blue first!This place was where I tried my very first Boba Tea (maybe 14 years ago.. welp. Getting old). Because of this, Bento will always hold a special place in my heart.  The sweet jasmine green tea with chewy boba is impossible to resist. As far as food items, I have tried a good portion of the menu but I have my main staples: Spicy Salmon Salad (spicy mayo on side and extra wakame), Spicy Salmon Don (when I'm extra hungry, extra wakame and maybe eel added), ginger shrimp bento box (very ginger-y), red curry rice bowl (silken tofu not fried and/or shrimp). I always get a green tea with tapioca boba but occasionally I also get a kiwi slush with boba (they freeze unlike mochi but I like them frozen) As far as the quality of the food, it could be fresher and sometimes the fish is cut a little odd in the sushi bowls, but it's not fine dining and Bento is really easy to call in and pick up when I'm heading home from errands via Newberry Road so it's not a huge deal to comprise a bit of quality for convenience sometimes.. I'm not a big fan of the Chirashi bowl mostly because I always feel a little disappointment with the assortment of fish. It's ok but not a stand out item. I do love that they don't force you into getting the tofu fried like some other Pan-Asian in town do.Service is always super friendly, everyone working seems very knowledgeable of the menu and I never get any confused looks for requests to substitute, add or omit items from my order. The inside area is pretty small but the environment is there. Dim lighting (I hate when places ruin an experience with harsh, abrasive lighting), Postal Service or some similar music playing, and anime on the TV a lot of the time :) Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for some quick, Pan-Asian fare that doesn't leave your pockets more empty than your belly!"
10/10/2018,3,It's just okay. It's quick Americanized Asian food. I'd say it's like a nicer Panda Express and it's made to order. The service is good though
8/12/2014,4,"Mt. Fuji roll!!!!! They also have some new wings that are pretty good...Service is friendly, as always."
8/23/2018,1,"They got rid of my favorite tangy chicken katsu sauce and replaced it with ""BBQ katsu sauce"" which is really just normal tonkatsu sauce you can get from any Asian market. I'm in absolute despair."
3/24/2019,5,"Love the here, it's a great place to eat with some friends after class.  Plus the have the tea with boba and the Coca-Cola freestyle machine. There is a lot of options to eat and drink from here."
12/19/2015,4,"I ate at Bento on Newberry tonight with my husband. It was a Saturday night, and there was a line to the door for ordering, and it moved quite slowly. The tiny restaurant was packed, and after we had placed our orders, there was no place to sit. I hovered over a table with people who looked like they were about to leave until they actually did. Our food was brought out to us promptly, so I was pleasantly surprised by that. I had the sushi combo box, which was one california roll and 4 pieces each of Alaskan and Philly roll. My sushi was very tasty and fresh. My husband had the chicken pad thai, and I kept sampling from his bowl. He finished the entire thing- it was really good! Overall, I think I will stick to the Bento on Archer, just because there is more seating, but this location holds its own as well."
7/15/2013,3,"Bentos strives to be a trendy place to eat, and at one point might have been, but over the years the restaurant has begun to show its age. The dining room just doesn't seem clean like it used to be. The tables and eating utensils (not the chop sticks) usually seem dirty. The nice lighting inside the restaurant isn't going to hide a poorly cleaned dinning room. At this point I try to avoid dining in here. I do still get food to-go though. Their menu is pan Asian with plenty to choose from. The food on average is average. It's something to eat to get full, not something to eat to thoroughly enjoy. I recommend their beef bulgogi and chicken katsu. I prefer to get their noodle bowls upgraded to udon noodles over their bento boxes. I avoid their miso soup and salads (tough and drowned in ginger dressing). If you need a quick bite to eat before going to see a movie next door, this is an ideal location to visit. As long as Gainesville has freshmen, they'll have an audience. But as someone whose eaten here quite a bit over a long period of time, they aren't fooling me into thinking this is a cool place to eat with top notch food."
1/27/2019,2,"Not very good. Poke bowl was not great. Fish didnt taste fresh, rice was plain and not cooked well, the toppings were all bland. Fried tofu was good though. For the price I just expected better. Publix sushi tastes better then what they offer here. Wouldnt recommend this place."
7/25/2017,2,I love the food! But this location smells like poopy diaper every time I've been here and it's way to hot to sit outside.
5/26/2017,1,I was always a fan of Bento but this one sucked at customer service. We ordered two sushi boxes and boba teas for takeout. We got our teas quickly however i was waiting 26 minutes for my food. My husband mentioned to them about the wait time and literally the food was sitting on the counter for who knows how long. And i didn't even get an apology from them. Sorry Bento you've lost a faithful customer.
10/9/2018,1,"Never fails they always forget to send soy sauce, chopsticks, wasabi or ginger... even when you remind them. Like seriously should not be that hard"
10/10/2017,2,"Not a sushi connoisseur. I do eat sushi pretty often, though. Somehow I lived In gainesville for 1.5 years without trying Bento. I wish I hadn't. Poor food and wait time at non peak hours. I'm not someone who complains about stuff like this normally. Salmon in sushi was warm. You get the picture. Only reason for above 1 star was free refills and cold stone across the street that made the evening better. Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else. (Literally any other place in Gainesville.)"
5/10/2016,5,Tried the poké don bowl and my wife had the spicy tuna don bowl. Everything was so damn good! It tasted fresh and healthy and was a lot of food! The Coke freestyle machine was buggin out for everyone while we were there haha
7/10/2018,4,Awesome food!! The poke bowls are amazing as are the apps. Great for take out or delivery! Great go to for dinner when you're too busy or lazy too cook.
5/14/2016,5,"Just moved from Connecticut and was looking for a new place to get my sushi fix. I was a bit spoiled where I lived so I was looking through yelp to get recommendations when I came across this cute little place called Bento. I ordered several things to try off the menu, and was very pleased with the fresh fish served. It is absolutely a fantastic replacement for my sushi fix. I am now addicted to their milk teas which come in any flavor you can think of. They have a very large menu, one for sushi and one for hot entrees from the kitchen. I can see myself coming here often."
5/8/2018,5,"I have always loved Asian food, Bento is my favorite places to go for it. They have an awesome menu and the prices are reasonable. I almost always get there sushi combo box which is great."
8/20/2018,5,Great prices & really good food! The staff is super nice and the restaurant is clean with a great vibe!
5/13/2017,1,"Bento has gone downhill over the last couple of months. Today, I walked in to what smelled like a vomit-chamber. It was not an isolated smell. Not only did they mess up my order and give it to someone else, we were rudely handed our food items outside, and told to ""grab our utensils near the water machine."" There was seaweed in the boba tea, and tears in my salad. Usually, I go to Bento Red, but I figured I would give Bento Blue a chance, as it was open later. I'm heavily disappointed and I hope things change. Sincerely, a Bento Believer."
4/27/2018,4,"Great place for a quick bite. The sushi was tasty, the service was great. We had a poki bowl, a shrimp roll, and drive kind of dragon roll. The sushi was tasty and the poki bowl was huge! We try to stop here wherever we're in Gainesville."
4/6/2017,3,"Great food, but we had to eat outside because for some reason the restaurant itself smells terrible. I'm not sure what's going on in there, but it is not a good thing. Otherwise, service, food, presentation were all excellent."
2/23/2015,5,The bento boxes here are amazing and its the only place in town that makes a good milk tea.I'm a huge fan of the boxes as the ginger salads are perfect and the deserts are a great way to end the meal.
12/22/2016,5,"I was in love with this place and returned as often as I could unfortunately it was crowded most of the time so a good advice would be to call ahead. Located in a shopping plaza it could be easy to miss, plenty of parking and outside seating available. I ordered the Tuna rice bowl (w/o spicy mayo sauce) I'm a fan of clean eating and being able pick my ingredients is a plus, even though my bowl looked very simple (and plain) the Tuna was so great it didn't need any sauce. The menu is extensive and there are options for everyone. I wish I had one back home."
4/2/2018,5,"The Chicken pad Thai is to DIE for. Whether I dine in, or get it delivered, it is always on point. The staff is always efficient and professional. I'm so glad this location is so close to my office."
8/11/2017,5,"Loved the orange chicken, great portions and quick service. If you're in the mood for Chinese I'd suggest this place"
7/21/2019,1,"Over priced food and mediocre service. Staff was friendly enough, just seemed tired and over worked. Not a surprise from what I've heard of the Tong family (owners) and their litany of legal settlements over the years"
1/17/2018,5,"Priced a little high, but food is amazing! I have been coming here since early 2011 - The spicy salmon don is my favorite! They have lots to choose from if sushi isn't your thing though... lately I have been ordering the noodle bowls (love the udon, they are HUGE noodles). The spicy creamy shrimp and spicy creamy chicken over udon is so delicious.  They have rice bowls, as well as the noodle bowls, and there are several choices for the protein. The wait staff are always friendly, and I will continue to come here!"
6/28/2019,3,The food is good but the service is bad. Shout out to the Manager for treating me in a sort of bad way with his sarcastic tone. Definitely going to keep going to bentos but the one on Archer because I can't deal.
2/15/2017,4,Bento was one of my absolute favorite places when I lived in Gainesville. They have a pretty extensive menu and have college nights where they'll run specials with your college ID. My favorite order was either a bento box (all are delicious) or the pad Thai. I have been trying for seven months now in Texas to find a pad Thai that even remotely compares to the one at Bento. So delicious! This place gets crowded so I would usually order over the phone and my food would always be ready by the time I drove over
7/6/2016,2,"I was born and raised in Gainesville, where Bento was the staple of my pre-teen and teen years. Everytime I came back to visit, I'd find myself at Bento because of their reliably delicious and fairly priced food & bubble tea. This past visit, however, I was met with disappointment. There were flies covering one of the booths. Then, after waiting for quite some time, I overheard the staff say that they had forgotten to make my order. Once it was brought out, I noticed that they messed up my order by not including the fish I had chosen for my poke salad bowl (tuna rather than salmon), but at that point I just wanted to eat. Finally, the quality of their bubble tea has gone down dramatically in the past year. They must be ordering their supplies from a different distributor now, but the bubble tea tastes watered down and the bubbles aren't great. Even after the staff added more powder, there wasn't too much of a flavor difference, but the texture became very chalky. This review is only so negative because I know how great Bento once was, and this simply was not up to its previous standards."
12/3/2014,4,Love eating at this place. They have a large selection on the menu and food is always good. My Gf loves the teas.
10/1/2016,5,Awesome service and great food. Reasonable prices and good atmosphere. I got a Poké bowl and a taroberry Shake :)
1/18/2017,5,SO good! I had the yellow curry with crispy chicken and mini udon. I also had the matcha green tea boba. Delicious and not crazy expensive. I'd definitely come back.
6/10/2016,4,"I absolutely love sushi and thankfully Gainesville has two Bento locations. I am always pleased with my meal but the only bad thing I have to say is sometimes I have to wait a while for my food to come out. For that reason, I'll adjust my order somewhat if its a busy time of day and only get an uncooked roll so that it speeds up the process. Otherwise, I think its a fun place and a great way to help my sushi addiction!"
4/7/2016,2,"Not going to soften this up. My bento box was soggy, the salad was warm, my rice was in a soup of sauce, lacked flavor, my noodles were kind of cold,and meat was kinda cold.  Next time let your servers be at least fake nice."
7/21/2016,3,"I think the food is good, but a little pricey for essentially fast food. The reason for three stars is the lousy service. The folks behind the counters don't make eye contact and don't smile. They are working to get you out of their line. Kind of a bummer because I love the braised beef noodle soup."
1/16/2019,5,Too bad you can only give 5 stars. Devin the manager on duty at the Davie store when I was there provided the greatest service possible. The food was great but he provided greater customer service.
10/26/2013,3,"I had the Coconut Chicken Curry Bento Box. It had noodles, a mini salad, the chicken coconut curry, rice, green beans, and for some reason a Rice Krispie treat. The salad noodles and rice were perfect. The curry coconut chicken was so-so. It wasn't very good, too average. I was confused why there was a rice krispie treat because it had nothing to do with it. We also had the Zombie Roll which was unique and I liked it. I have never seen sushi with tiny red caviar and some fried green vegetable. It tasted good and I liked the variation of sushi. However, there was a cockroach in the men's bathroom. I told a woman and she said she'll do something to get it out."
2/2/2017,4,"Dons are by far the way to go. You get a ton of sushi for the $$. Make sure that you do the build-a-don to try all of the different meats. Sometimes the freshness can be a little hit or miss, but overall everything is usually great. The spicy cream chicken noodle bowl is amazing if you aren't a fan of sushi!"
7/23/2016,4,"Love this place.  Funny thing is that I like what's IN the bento boxes better than the entrees. The green beans, noodles and sweet wonton chips in every box are great. I like the beef teriyaki.  I also really like their bowls, it's a hard choice between a box and a chirashi bowl.  The poke had been the only thing I've had that has been disappointing.  And my son likes the popping bubbles in the tea. I steal more than my fair share."
11/14/2014,5,"This place is amazing. I don't understand the negative reviews. Sure, it's going to be busy depending on certain times. If you're going out for takeout or to dine in anywhere on a Friday or Saturday night in a college town what do you expect? Sometimes the lines move slow because of all the choices on the menu, or because the cashier is explaining a dish to a customer. But I've never waited too long to complain. At my most recent visit, something made me really upset though. I purchased a fountain drink and then walked to the back where they have one of those high tech fountain machines with all the choices. They only had seagrams ale and water available. I thought it was terrible that they let me buy a fountain drink when that's all they had. I'm confident they weren't aware though. I also didn't say anything, so I'm sure they would have helped. Just keep that in mind and check the fountains before buying soda."
1/31/2016,5,I've been going to the Bento for years since they first open. Now they have a new location closer to my house but I still go to both. I love the diversity of Asian delight at this establishment. I love their national champ roll. But it's hard to choose a favorite everything is good.
11/17/2016,4,Good Asian fusion and decent sushi for a fast-food type place. The spicy cream chicken is a must.
5/24/2013,4,"Bento is a great place for casual Asian food.The food is good...I have had some questionable dishes but when you order right, you will be satisfied. I love the spicy cream chicken or shrimp!Sushi is quite good. It is the only place in town that I will eat sushi. Try the spicy UF roll.The best part are the amazing prices. You get a lot of very tasty food for extremely fair prices."
11/18/2013,4,"The Environment:Great for groups, very young feeling, and pretty hip!  Definitely a good place to be.The Food:I had the spicy creamy shrimp in a rice bowl.  It was... DELICIOUS.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The flavor was very unique, not like anything I had tried before.There's also alcohol and a huge menu.  But I think it'd be worth trying again!"
3/16/2013,4,"I recently went gluten-free... so I have ventured into the world of sushi which I never really had before.  Bento has become one of my quick options for food... it's really easy to make any dish gluten free by asking for steamed chicken or shrimp instead of fried.  I have a favorite creation that I stick to... it's a spicy tuna roll with a few additions (cream cheese, avocado and cucumber).  Check out this place, it's pretty good!"
7/11/2012,5,"So I am from fort lauderdale... Back home there isn't great bubble tea. The best place we had was lollicup. Lollicup close though. So for me to go to Gainesville and find this place was a miracle. Of course, it's thru recommendation! I tried the sushi and I had the bubble tea. I had a mocha magic! It was great:) I love it. The sushi was great.I saw someone order a crunchy salmon roll, it look great and taste even better!let me tell you the price was a bonus! We ate 2 rolls, and soda, and a bowl of rice of bulgogi for $25.00 ? Maybe 30 but that's nothing compare to what we usually pay! I love it! It's fun! The environment is great :) all the girls are pretty and kind too!! Love it!"
4/3/2016,5,Best sushi I ever had. Nice seating outside and inside. Can get any sushi roll tempura fried. So good.
6/30/2011,4,"Yay! My friend used to try and convince me to go here with her, but I always thought it was a bit overpriced, so I usually just ate a burrito from next door while she inhaled the Bento box (minus the plastic). Tonight D and I went with our hard earned garage sale cash, $24. Yum! Glad we made that decision. We ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken, the Florida roll, and the Gainesville roll, all to share. I ended up eating more of the sushi, however. The fish was plenty, the rice, sticky but not mushy, seaweed not overpowering the taste nor texture of it's contents. We called in take out for the fear of not making it in time for outdoor seating, and it was made just in time for our arrival. Good hours, nice staff, tasty Thai tea with boba FTW!"
9/18/2015,5,Nice clean place. Modern decor. Self served mixed cola machine. A little pricy but the food was fresh and delicious.
6/22/2010,3,"So I've been back quite a few times and have had their Bulgogi and Teriyaki.  I am happy to report that I have not gotten sick once.  That being said,  Bento has become my go to place for Meat-N-Rice/Noodle dishes though I am not blown away by their Bento boxes.  There is always at least one component of the bento box that is sub-par (the first time it was the noodles and dessert,  last time it was dessert only).  I generally stick to the rice/noodle bowls and teas.It 'aint Momofuku Noodle Bar (nowhere close) but it does fill a niche."
1/5/2009,4,"Can they keep up with all of the customers? Sure they can!  There is often a line, but don't be discouraged, because the line moves fast and you are guaranteed an excellent  meal.  The only thing about this location is that they do not serve duck, but everything else on the menu is the same if not better. Their food is authentic, nutritious, trendy, exiting, and fulfilling at once. The atmosphere is amazing with groovy ambient techno and glowing tables. There are families, college students, and elderly couples are dining there and enjoying all that they have to offer. Gainesville is so lucky to have such an amazing local business in their town that caters to everyone, offering a taste of Taiwanese teahouse culture, rivaling some of the greats, such as Saints Alp Teahouse. Most meals are about $6.50 and come in a Bento box as a six course meal. The food is a terrific mix of Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese. Noodle bowls, soup bowls, rice bowls, sushi, tempura, bento boxes, and teriyaki. The highlight of the dining experience is the bubble tea. If you have not tried it, then you are missing out. In the hot Florida months, my favorite is Jasmine Green tea with green apple syrup and lychee jelly."
3/18/2015,5,"Amazing place to hangout at and have a small meal! Their bento boxes are really good and come with so many things. My boyfriend likes their rice bowls and has visited 3 times already! Really cool soda machines, too. They have AC problems sometimes but it's not too bad."
11/19/2009,4,"I've never had the sushi here, but the food entrees are delicious.  I always get the rice bowl (you can also get a bento box), which includes your choice of entree atop a bed of white rice in a large bowl.  The quality of the meat is good and the vegetables have always been fresh and cooked properly.  I recommend the spicy Korean chicken (it's not that spicy), red curry beef (very spicy), or the sweet and sour chicken.The atmosphere is very relaxed.  Dim lighting, with some tables having fluorescent light bulbs within the tables.  Some staff members can be friendly, and some can be stoic.  After your meal, you leave your trash and empty plates at the table and an employee will take care of it.  This is good if you just want to eat, then get up and go."
11/10/2007,2,"Bento's is a place to go if you want a quick bite of decent food to eat.  They offer food in rice bowls or in a bento box with some sides.  I recommend not ordering from that side of the menu due to the lack of consistency, cold (meaning not kept hot when it should be) sides, and smaller portions.  The only thing I ever enjoyed were the noodle soup bowls.  I ordered the chicken katsu udon bowl and I added vegetables for an extra charge.  The katsu was somewhat crispy, but nowhere near as good as can be. I'm not quite sure if they use a panko crust, and if they did it's not very good.  The soup overall was fine, the udons were average, and the watery soup lacking depth but still somewhat tasty.  The better bowl out there is the sliced Szechuan beef.In the sushi area, they mostly serve rolls and they have just average quality fish.  You can easily tell because they heavily dress their rolls with a bunch of stuff, but hey, at least it's edible. I don't dare try their nigiri.Service is fine.  2.5 stars overall!"
7/16/2012,2,"Ordered the red curry over rice, and it literally tasted like nothing. It was like eating styrofoam packing peanuts and then every once in a while my mouth would feel hot. Tofu was undercooked and the pad thai had a fishy taste. Bland, boring, and not worth the hype.... it's like the Kim Kardashian of Asian food."
11/1/2012,3,"Bento Cafe, or Bento Blue as the Bento folks like to call it, was the first Bento restaurant of their now six or more establishments in Gainesville, Orlando, and Jacksonville. It opened in either 2003 or 2004 and just short of a decade of business, it is starting to show some wear to its somewhat-sleek interior. Certainly, after Bento Red (Archer Road) expanded, the atmosphere at Bento Blue seems rather plain and even in need of work in places. I've had no less than three first dates here though and have fond nostalgia for the place so I'd probably hate to see too much of a change, in all candor.As for the food, their menu of bento-box and rice bowl pan-Asian dishes has remained much the same for years though now and then new menu items have been added. Their sushi is good, but not great, as one would expect for the quasi-fast-food approach at hand. The bento boxes come with white rice, noodles, green beans, a salad with ginger dressing, and a small dessert like a cookie and that's not changed since opening day as far as I know. Sometimes these sides are quite good, other times the noodles are tough or rice overcooked. The main dishes themselves vary a lot, but I've recently noticed they're often overly salty--especially those like the basil stir-fry that have a lot of a sauce with them. The katsu fares very well though and the General Tso's chicken is ok. The sushi . . . often pretty good, sometimes not good at all. The krab delite nigiri and the Mexican rolls are my favorites though and always impressive, albeit simple. The more complex rolls . . . well, more to go wrong I suppose and sometimes that's exactly what happens. Bento's fun, but the Bento Red location is better than this one: I'd probably give that location four stars instead of three. I would not choose either just for sushi on nights I want to go out for sushi though. Mahzu is light-years better in that regard. The bento boxes and decently-priced, informal, meals with friends are what Bento's all about and it's great for that, but be well prepared that things can be a bit off at times . . . and quite salty very often."
2/6/2007,4,"Oh man,i love Bento! I eat here all the time.Qay better than the overrated-gas-inducing Moe's.Bento blows that joint out of the water.Cheap,tasty Bento boxes,fast service from hot honeys ;-`) sealed the deal for me."
12/18/2015,2,"Decent food, disappointed in that my chicken was all dark meat chunks that were fatty and quite honestly nasty compared to my buddy who got all nice white meat strips even though we ordered the same thing.  Teriyaki sauce was lacking, lo mein was a bright spot though.  Too expensive for the little food you get and the taste is not gonna make you feel like your money was well spent.  I'd rather go to pei wei, but still way better than China Star, that place blows big time"
9/6/2013,5,"This is my favorite place in Gainesville. It's a great environment with both indoor and outdoor seating and always great music. They have a wide selection of bento boxes, noodle and rice bowls, sushi, and boba drinks. I have never been disappointed. I prefer this location to the Archer Rd location. It's smaller but service is faster and they don't charge extra for sauces."
7/25/2012,4,Bento is always consistent with quality and affordable Asian fusion.The best deal is the sushi bowl IMO. More fish than a roll at the same price.
4/25/2011,5,"I love this Bento SO much more than the one on Archer. They don't nickel and dime you. Period. If you ask for an extra sauce, it's free. In fact they have eel sauce, spicy mayo, and the like right in front to pump into plastic ramekins. I love their rolls, especially my current obsessions: National Champ roll  and their Lust roll. I'm also a huge fan of their Spicy Cream Shrimp. Their fish is nice and fresh. I've never had a nigiri or sashimi that I didn't love. Tip: If you plan to go when it's busy call ahead and ask for takeout, that way you can avoid the ridiculous lines that form during nights and weekends."
12/31/2017,5,Food quick and amazing. Love their poke bowls and prices are reasonable. This location has outdoor seating so great for bringing my pups along.
2/15/2010,4,"Bentos cafe focuses on the experience and the atmosphere.  But their food is pretty well presented and adequate.  This is my 4th time going this semester. I always get the bento box teriyaki beef but this time I got the General tso Chicken bento box.Before I criticize the general Tso Chicken, I want to clarify that I can make my own General tso chicken and I can make it good hehe.  Anyhow,  the general Tso chicken's presentation was good.  The chicken was nicely done with the crispiness.  The sauce was done well also, however when you eat the chicken with the rice.  It feels like the sauce is not there.  The sauce doesn't have the power to overcome the blandness of the rice.  The sauce supposed to have that power, not the saltiness of the sauce but the flavor of the sauce.  It felt like the General Tso sauce was DILUTED....   Anyhow , every time I make my chicken, I make sure it is strong enough to over come the rice's flavor.  Anyway, the side of veggie (brocolli) was weak!   They gave me 3 pieces of Brocolli.  So cheap :-(     Anyhow, overall the food was good.  The ginger salad was good and the lomein along with the little cake dessert."
12/26/2009,4,"The Boba Teas are delicious and a favorite of mine. I especially like the almond joy flavor.The sushi is good, nothing special, but still good.Various side dishes such as Miso soup or edamame are also average, but still hit the spot.I love the different bowls, however. The Tofu Thai Curry bowl over rice is always delicious. As is a variety of other tofu bowls. I love how they have many tofu options, which is great for vegetarians. The boxes are okay, but I prefer getting the bowls due to the large portion size.Well priced and has a nice atmosphere. I also like the convenience of the location. This is a restaurant I frequent and would recommend if you're looking for something cheap, good, and better than just some quick drive thru. Great before or after a movie over at Royal Park!"
8/28/2011,5,"I love this restaurant and highly recommend it.The food has always been good here--the sushi is decent, depending on the chef.  Done right, the sushi is delicious--I've always liked the volcano roll or the red dragon.  The tuna don is also pretty good--the wakame and the tuna makes for great texture as you bite in to it.  The szechuan beef noodle soup is also great--it's similar to the niu rou mian that's found in Taiwan--pretty authentic and it tastes good.  The boba tea is pretty good too. The boba's consistency and texture is second only to Lollicup.  I've always been a fan of the katsu chicken--compared to other restaurants, it's always crunchy and tender--but the katsu pork has a little too much fat in it.Overall, I love this restaurant and I go here almost once a day.Some of the reviews on here are incredible--sushi is rolled loosely so when you bite in to it, the sushi *bursts.*  And food not coming out all at once?  Really? You're going to complain about that?  Or that the food isn't ""vegan"" because there's cream cheese in it? (Hello! Read the ingredient list on the sushi menu!)."
8/2/2009,3,"OK, let me preface my review by stating that this was my absolute favorite spot during my sophomore and junior years at UF. Now, three years later, it's not the same. The sushi doesn't taste as fresh as it used to and the service has also fallen below the mark. The last time I ate at Bento, my miso soup came out after my sushi rolls and it was lukewarm (and lacking tofu!!). What happened to the Blue Bento I used to know?????"
1/27/2017,1,"Came to get our takeout order. We both ordered udon. They gave us the wrong noodle. Took forever to correct - somehow when they gave us the food again and we got home they gave us one udon and remade the other with mini udon AGAIN? We also ordered our sushi with sauce on the side and they told us it was on the side but when we got home it wa s on the sushi...with two cups of sauce on the side. My katsu bowl didn't even come with the tonkotsu sauce it was supposed to, so now I have dry noodles with no sauce. What a disappointing experience considering how much money we spent."
5/2/2009,3,"I've visited Bento twice on my lunch break.  The first time I had a smoked salmon, avocado, and scallion roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  Both were fine but nothing special.  Mall sushi, I call it.  I don't think I'd try their raw fish.  On my second visit I had the spicy cream chicken bento box.  The chicken was nicely crispy with a very flavorful sauce, but the sides weren't worth bothering with.  Probably better to order the meat entree with a rice bowl and skip the mushy green beens, cold noodles, wilted salad, and dry cake that comes in the bento box.I don't like the food well enough to want to go have a sit-down meal there, but it's an acceptable choice for quick, inexpensive takeout."
2/12/2016,3,Meh....Their signature noodle soup is salty. Their chicken wings are not bad though. The fried dumplings were too dry. Service was only average.
10/13/2014,3,"Most of their sushi rolls are pretty good. I gave a three star rating mainly because they can be a hit-and-miss. I like the mango roll, but there have been times where it has been pretty mediocre. Their milk teas are really good."
2/9/2009,4,"When in Gainsville...visit Bento Cafe. After hearing about it for years - this little place is known to visitors even though it may be difficult to find (this location especially)The atmosphere is pretty dope and this location's theme is blue, as in ICE. The restaurant itself has both indoor and outdoor seating and is a very trendy place to frequent. Don't be surprised if you find professors, students - Asians and non-Asians alike there.The food is good (with the exception of the little desert in the Bento Box), the sushi is acceptable. I was a little weirded out by the fact that they didn't put eel sauce on my eel rolls. In fact, I had to get up and get it myself - or rather, have my bf get it for me. I'm not going to lie, the service was surprisingly fast and the fact that they have all college kids working there makes me feel like it's a fun place to be.Oh, the Bubble tea is also very good - probably the best in Gainesville. If not the only."
10/11/2011,4,"Bento (blue) is great if you have a craving for boba tea and sushi. I've only had their sushi, but I'm looking forward to trying something from the other menu.The dragon roll is SO good. So is lust, especially if you like spicy mayo. Inexpensive, good and quick (even if there's a line)."
11/22/2009,4,"I used to eat sushi at Bento RELIGIOUSLY during my junior year at UF. I can't say I've had any of the entrees at Bento but they always look tasty when I see other people order them. To be honest, they just don't look like they would fill me up. But I'm sure they are tasty. Bento is really good about call-in orders. I used to do this all the time because the place gets PACKED! When I say packed, I mean that the line to order is out the door like Chipotle when they give away free burritos. Every time I go, I order either the Flying Dragon or the Red Dragon, ALWAYS. I love tempura shrimp, crab and avocado and both of these rolls has each. The only difference between the two is that the Red Dragon is topped with tuna and the Flying Dragon is topped with eel. Along with one of these two rolls, I usually order a bunch of other random rolls that I haven't tried before. Depending on my mood, I order a Mango Bubble Tea. Completely DELICIOUS!!!"
6/10/2017,5,"When I want Asian food that I know I can rely on to be delicious I go to Bento's and order a Sesame Tofu bento box. The food is so delicious and well-cooked, and the portions are so satisfying. Their sushi is good too. I prefer this location as opposed to the one on Archer because it is way less crowded and even if there are a lot of people, the line and service is always fast."
7/7/2007,4,"It's fast food pan-asian cuisine, but it's really pretty tasty and for the price... wow.  Go here if you're in the mood for some quick asian food, but don't fancy fried, MSG-laced stuff.  The sushi is unremarkable.  You won't regret ordering it, but it's certainly not going to wow you."
11/8/2010,5,"The food was good and cheap depending on what you get. There's all sorts of asian food from korean, chinese to japanese. It gets really crowded from time to time because lots of college kids come here to get ""bento"" lunchbox style food. They also serve bubble tea which was pretty cheap. Also a sushi bar to eat at.The location is great because it's in a  new/clean  plaza with lots of other restaurant that are great to visit too. Bento is expanding their restaurant which is  a plus!A great place to visit if you're in the area!"
10/20/2015,5,"Best sushi in town. Love it here, the Red Dragon roll is my favorite & also the general tos chicken :) Super yummy!"
9/2/2008,5,"Bento is amazing. I have never eaten at the same place so many times (at the height, more than 4 times a week) and still craved it; so much so that when I make it back to Gainesville this is the one place that am guaranteed to make a stop at. The menu is huge, the sushi is great, the bento boxes (repetitive, I know) are filling, and all for a pretty good price. The wait can sometimes be a little much, but in my opinion it is well worth it, plus the semi-wait service (you order at the counter and the food is brought to your table) dulls the pain. However, if you can't handle the wait at all feel free to call ahead, stop by ten minutes later, and take it home, or have the audacity to eat it there!There are no words to describe how much I love and miss Bento...Oh, I don't recommend getting the shrimp tempura, in a roll it's great, but just the tempura...not so awesome."
11/4/2015,4,Bento is my go-to sushi or ahi tun bowl place. The sushi and ahi tuna always taste fresh to me. I like that I order my food quickly and it is brought to me. I go to Bento probably once a week because I am a total sushi addict.
4/7/2009,3,"Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. The place has a nice atmosphere(blue lights & stainless steel) and the service is generally great, but the menu is boring and the food is just so-so. There is nothing unique or exciting here and the vegetarian options are less than impressive. You can get a nice big tasty bowl of spicy tuna sashimi here for ~$7, but it's not the best sushi joint in town--even for the moderate price range.This is a good option if you have a large group of people with a major disagreement about where to get dinner, as there is an adjourning southwestern restaurant and a smoothie bar which share the same outdoor seating(so your group can eat at different restaurants and still sit at the same table)."
10/10/2007,3,"Excellent udon bowls.  Other reviewers are correct about their sushi; it's a good grade but not excellent, and doesn't at all compare to the better sushi restaurants in town.  Bento boxes are a mixed bag; the meat dish/main course is usually piping hot, while the surrounding side dishes are inevitably cold (as in, ""not kept warm"" rather than ""meant to be cold"").  The boba tea is delicious--they used to have fruit bits for the ""pearls,"" which made for a more interesting drink.   Sadly, they've returned to tapioca only.Visit the Newberry Road shop if you have a choice--the Archer Road location is more difficult to get to/park at, more disorganized, and the food isn't as skillfully prepared.  The rating takes a star hit on behalf of the second store--it's that bad."
7/15/2015,5,"This is a staple for me in Gainesville. I have never had a bad food experience here, and everything I've tried has been excellent.My go-to meal is fried Udon, but the Sushi is really a star here in Gainesville. I recommend getting an executive roll, like Flying Dragon, for a great sushi experience.All regular entrees have been great. My favorite is Broccoli (Kung Pao).I prefer Newberry Bento over Archer. The atmosphere is much nicer and you generally don't have to wait in line outside the door."
6/30/2008,4,I just discovered the joy of putting Sriracha sauce in my veggie rice bowl.I can feel that ulcer coming.
6/15/2011,3,Went here while in town searching for housing in the area with the husband. We had some sushi and the general Tso's rice bowl. The sushi was good but the rolls need to be better rolled as they fell apart as you pick them up. The general Tso's rice bowl has tasty but I feel it could have been spicier.  The tables that we sat at where sticky and probably could have been wiped down alot better between customers. The final decision: I would go back again. Food was decent and worth another try.
6/10/2017,1,Paid for over-fried chicken and more sauce than rice in my bowl. I couldn't even bite thru the rubber chicken so I paid to throw it away. The kitchen staff really should learn to cook something that they themselves would eat. I understand they probably don't get paid enough to care that much but it's killing this business because I'm not the only one who knows how terrible they are. Never going back to bento. Step up your game! Smh
12/26/2013,1,"Nothing like the Bentos in Orlando. very disappointing.  the food not really that good and the service. What service. you order,and  dont ask questions. If you want fast food atmosphere and don't care about polite workers , its your place. I realize its a College town but taking my order and being rude doesn't justjfy me putting money in a tip jar. Very very dissapointing. I won't be back."
11/17/2014,3,"Love their Bento boxes, especially the chicken katsu. Crab wontons are good. I have yet to try the sushi here though. They have decent food & atmosphere, unfortunately they don't stand out to me when deciding on dining options. I tend to only go here when others suggest. They're not bad, just not exceptional either."
12/22/2014,5,"My boyfriend and I love this place. He gets the Mongolian beef rice bowl, and I get the Mexican roll. Other favorites of mine are the crunch, masarap, and Florida rolls. Their spicy mayo is also the best around."
9/23/2014,4,"Great food and a good price.  My go-to place for something quick and delicious.  Bento boxes are always great,  but the spicy beef udon noodle soup is my favorite!"
4/28/2017,4,I'm an extremely loyal constumer to Bento. I love their sushi rolls and bento boxes. The Archer road one has better delivery service and can actually follow direction. AMAZING SUSHI. Go to place for anytime and good teas! Manger at Newberry one is extremely rude and disorganized.
7/5/2014,5,"Okay, I love Bento. They have a ton of selections. My brother got the general tso bento box and it was pretty good. I got the create-a don which a create a sushi bowl with salmon,crab and shrimp. I loved it! Gotta have the spicy mayo though. I thought the Starburst (strawberry banana) milk tea boba was okay, but the actual boba balls were made just right. Can't wait to try more when they open one in Tampa hopefully soon! The prices aren't bad either."
8/24/2014,5,I love bento! Best place in Gainesville for a quick Asian meal. I went here probably 500 times in college and ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box 95% of the time. I also drowned everything I got in spicy mayo so everything was great.
8/29/2010,4,"I originally hated this place, but it was one of my girlfriend's favorite places to go, and I have to say that it has grown on me. I really like it now and have been tons of times. I especially like this location, as opposed to the one on Archer Road. I usually get the sweet and sour chicken bento box, and most of the time at the Archer location the chicken is soggy and tastes much worse than the chicken from the Newberry location. Also, this place has some pretty good sushi. It definitely isn't the best I've ever had, but most of the times I have gotten it it has been very good. I also get the Boba teas every once in a while and they are definitely worth a try as well."
3/14/2015,3,"The Bento Cafe is one of my family's favorite places to go for lunch. The sushi and noodle bowls are our go-to orders. I usually get the create-a-roll with steamed shrimp and tuna, and the fish always tastes extremely fresh. The only complaint is that it takes a long time for the food to get to the table. If I order sushi, it takes at least 25-30 minutes for it to arrive. Whereas if my Dad orders a beef teriyaki noodle bowl, he gets his food within 10 minutes. As a result, by the time I get my sushi, my Dad has already finished his meal."
12/6/2016,4,Very good casual Asian kitchen and sushi. I love their chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Even the veggies are great in it. Teriyaki and white sauce are amazing. Sushi is above average but the price reflects it as it's not very expensive for the rolls compared to Japanese in the area. Good atmosphere. Archer road location is much bigger and better in my opinion
7/26/2014,5,"Great food, great daily freebies and deals, even options for low-carb eaters! Their sushi is amazing, but you can definitely load up on food for cheap with their Bento box.  Their garlic ginger chicken is to die for! Limited indoor seating, but they do have an outdoor area and delivery options."
1/15/2017,3,Bento is good as far as food is concerned but their customer service was poor today. My wife's order was forgotten and delivered much later than my meal. It is understandable that mistakes can occur but one of the cooks eye rolled my wife when she was just wanting to know if their was a mistake. The waitress was understandable and just checking with the chef. This is by no means a condemnation but just a poor response.
12/23/2013,4,Went there on my birthday and had the pork chop udon soup which was AMAZING! I don't recommend getting the bento boxes because I always find the noodles and green beans too salty. Service was quick but the only complaint was that the cashier wasn't really paying attention and she forgot my boba tea order....
10/9/2015,5,All time favorite. We moved to WA State and still get our Bento fix in every time we come back. 5 words...Curry Katsu Chicken Noodle Bowl. Enough said.
4/18/2012,4,"Out of all the sushi places that I have been to around town Bento definitely has the best deals. You cannot beat the prices to the amount of meat you get in a sushi roll. Usually many places skimp on the ingredients but not this place. Their dons (sashimi rice bowls) are also a good choice to make on the menu, as they also give you a lot for your buck. They also have deals on certain days that if you buy two rolls a free order of edamame comes with it. Aside from sushi, the restaurant provides an array of cooked food as well. Ranging from teriyaki chicken to curry which are all decently sized. However I must warn that if you come on a weekend be prepared to wait for your food because the place does get packed and the service gets slow. Overall a good place to eat at with reasonably priced food. Will come back again."
7/17/2016,4,"I love bento. I may even be borderline obsessed. It's my first stop every time I come back home to visit my family. But seriously, this has been a consistent problem for the last few years: WHY THE HELL IS EVERY SURFACE IN THE STORE ALWAYS SO DAMN STICKY? The chairs! The walls! The tables! The freaking drink machine !!!?!?!!!"
9/6/2015,2,great service but my rolls of sushi were falling apart. wish there was a wasabi in Gainesville.
6/21/2011,1,"Won't be back. I ordered a simple green tea and a veggie delight roll which the server told me was vegan. The green tea had tons of sweetner in it and was $6! The server exchanged it for a glass of water when I said I wanted unsweet green tea. I waited about 20 minutes for one sushi roll and guess what...they messed up my order and served me a veggie delight roll with cream cheese (not vegan). When I told the manager, so offered to pay me for the difference and I had to demand a full refund. She never even offered to remake the roll to fix their error. She made it seem like I was a bother to her"
4/22/2011,3,"I realize that I like this place way more than I should.  I wanted to give four stars but simply couldn't in good conscience.  Let's say that these three stars are really 3.5.   This Bento is always packed with a line out the door at peak meal times.  That being said, I would expect that they would have a more efficient ordering system.  Instead there is only one register manned by 3-5 college aged girls that are confusingly taking phone orders and my order simultaneously.  Somehow it all gets figured out, but the ordering process takes forever.     I like to order the chicken red curry bento box.  In a fast food type place like Bento, I would never expect that the curry would be spicy, but it is, nice and spicy, yum.  I usually have to doctor it up a bit because its a little bland, but with a little spicy eel sauce and a touch more sriacha it tastes just the way I like it.  The bento box comes with Lo Mein noodles (uncharacteristically my favorite part), rice (more carbs please), stir fried green beans, crappy wilted ginger salad, and some version of a little debbie dessert.  Ok, I know this doesn't sound too great, but again I like it so much more than I should.  I crave this sad little plate of fast Asian fusion, I realize its wrong, but it feels so right.   The thing about Bento is that the service is awkward.  I always go with a friend or two, and the food never comes out together.  I feel strange diving into my dinner while my date waits for his/her meal to arrive.  If you wait politely, however,  you will wait forever, sometimes food has been spaced as much as ten minutes apart...awkward.  All that being said I still love this place, I think the kicker for me is the self service sauce bar.  The bar has sriacha, eel sauce, spicy eel sauce, shrimp sauce, and spicy mayo.  I love being able to gluttonously gorge on these sauces without facing the shame of actually asking for them.     I visit Bento usually once every two weeks, with no intention of stopping.  I may never understand my strange Bento addiction, but love can be perplexing."
12/20/2015,5,When ordering our food the woman was so helpful and nice and the food came out fast and hot! I had the Spicy Cream chicken Noodle Bowl lo mein and it was delicious! My family enjoyed their noodle bowls as well. My cousin order sushi but it took very long and when she asked about it they apologized and have her a $5 gift card for the wait. Overall great place! Great food and service!
3/17/2016,4,The bowls are large portions. I recommend the spicy cream chicken and the peach green tea.
3/15/2012,2,Meh it's ok !! Maybe I'm a sushi snob but I'd rather pay more and get better quality.  Not really a fan ...  I mean it wasn't the worst place ever but I'd rather eat elsewhere.
8/3/2016,4,"I'm relatively new to Gainesville, and was sad to leave my old regular Asian food fix behind, and have tried out quite a few, and so far Bento Cafe has been pretty decent! I've only ordered in from here, and gotten mostly the same thing. My first time was from the place on Archer Rd from the hotel I was staying at, and comparatively I did enjoy it better! The first time I ordered from here though, I actually didn't enjoy it very much. My food was cold & ended up getting sent the wrong thing (I asked for rice and instead for lo mein with my katsu, and everything was awful except the miso soup I ordered, the lo mein noodles were bad and there was absolutely no flavor to it and the chicken was just...bad). This next time around I got a thing of miso again since it didn't disappoint, and instead got the fried rice bowl, and both were AMAZING, everything was nicely cooked (still a little cold but not as bad as last time) and the flavor of the fried rice really hit the spot. It definitely doesn't replace my old place, but this time around really made up for the first bad experience, I'm excited to eat from here again!"
1/19/2012,2,"i ordered to-go here (for the first time) and this is what happened:i had a very sad, long, complex day -- one that calls for yummy food over rice -- and i didn't feel like dealing with bento bros. so i ordered something new (gasp), the spicy creamy shrimp rice bowl, and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the boy. i also ordered an almond milk tea with mango jellies. yes, i ordered mango jellies and strayed from the usual tapioca pearls. call me crazy if you'd like.the milk tea was fine, but the jellies were scarce. they were good, and that made it even worse. there weren't even really enough to see them at the bottom of the cup. i had maybe a tablespoon of them in there.the spicy creamy shrimp, i found out when i got home, was chicken. it was fried chicken mixed with a sweet sauce and sauteed in their spicy mayo. i love their spicy mayo. this was pretty disgusting. it reminded me of an extremely bad take on the dim sum walnut shrimp -- and it was chicken. the breading wasn't even crispy. it was like someone fried it in funnel cake batter, very pancake-y.the teriyaki chicken was meh. the sauce wasn't thick like teriyaki sauce is supposed to be. it tasted just like a sweetened soy sauce.i was trying to choose between bento and mi apa for dinner, and i really should have listened to advice and gone for mi apa. dammit."
2/25/2010,4,"oops . . . accidentally posted the review for the other location here!  so i'll write this one too . . . this is the ""original"" bento . . . and what *made* this location special was that they had traditional taiwanese dishes that were on small slabs of wood posted on the column next to the ordering register . . . they had xue hua rou si mien (snow bowl) which was one of my (and my dad's) favorites . . . unfortunately, apparently not enough people ordered it and they took it off the menu . . . but anyway, their schezuan beef noodle soup is another great choice."
1/6/2009,3,"The place is unique and the prices aren't bad.  But I think the food could be better.  Giving it a 3 stars b/c it was one of the first places I found in Gainesville that had the asian milk tea, which isn't too bad considering they use powder but a little pricey.  The food was ok, sushi wasn't anything special.  It's a place you go once in a while to change things up and different atmosphere."
8/18/2010,5,This place def. gets five stars in my book....why? Because its super cheap and delicious!! I love their sashimi bowls...and of course their spicy mayo!!! I really don't like their bento boxes but if you do decide to get one...katsu chicken or fish is def. the best!!! :)
11/21/2009,4,"What can I say, when I am in Gainesville, Bento is defiantly on the to-do list. The Miami roll is to die for, I have dreams about it. The Bento boxes aren't too bad either. They consistently deliver great food."
6/28/2013,5,This is my favorite sushi in Gainesville! My husband and I come here all the time. It's great. He loves the spicy cream shrimp!
12/21/2010,2,"pad thai really bad.extremely dry, 2 layers of noodle and bottom layer was just boiled noodle. not authentic too commercialized"
8/11/2011,4,"Really good sushi and the bento box chicken was good,"
11/11/2015,5,"I go here once a week at least. So many good options! Try the spicy tuna don. Or if you don't like rice, the kawaii roll is a fresh and delicious alternative to a normal sushi roll. Food comes out fast and perfect every time"
9/28/2009,5,I have had some Bubble Teas close enough to compare.  The pearls at Shing Wang in North Miami Beach are much better; but I will have to return since Bento Cafe is the only place I can find that has Pineapple flavored milk teas.  Sigh...
8/16/2011,5,"You can't go wrong for the price...but Red Bentos is better because it has Jasmine Milk Bubble Tea! I love the sushi boxes, donburis, and spicy cream shrimp."
10/15/2009,2,"I have heard a lot of good things about this place.  When I lived in japan bento boxes were a staple.  I was excited to try this place.  The price is very reasonable, the menu has a lot of options and the boxes are cleverly put together.  My wife's sushi looked good and my sister in law's Unadon looked and smelled great.  This place showed that the owners know their stuff.  It is nice to be able to get a variety of japanese, thai and chinese food.     The gripe that I have and my explanation for an ""I've experienced better"" was that my Chicken Katsu did not have the Katsu sauce on it.  I was looking forward to that taste.  Had I known that they didn't serve it that way it wouldn't have bothered me.  The sauce was a spicy japanese mayo (which was good).  When I asked the server for some katsu sauce she responded ""soy sauce?"" I said no the katsu sauce.  She pointed out the spicy mayo and said that is how they serve it.  I'm not one to aggravate the people who handle my food, so I said ""not the  Japanese katsu sauce?  oh, ok.""        I was a little frustrated at the server's shortness and her hurry to get back behind the counter.  I was surprised because the quality of the food I got for 7.50 was great and the smartly put together menu makes me think the absence of a sauce named after the food is a little weird.  Maybe my server was a bum and couldn't wait to get back to socializing.      I would go back and give it another try.  I would order the same thing again even without the beloved katsu sauce.  I want to try the donburi, but am a little nervous about what sauce they may substitute. If the service is better and at least don't act like I am making a crazy request I will probably change my rating to a 3 or maybe even a 4 star."
12/7/2012,3,"This bentos isnt as good as the bento red on archer, but it's still ok. Their bentos and noodle bowls are both pretty good, but dont seem to be as good as their red location. It's not ""authentic"" but it is good. The decor is well done to look trendy with a blue and black theme. Like the other one, its a good place to go to grab a bite with some friends."
11/10/2007,3,"This is a nice spot with fairly fast service and decent food.  The service is also great and the staff is friendly.  However, I am unable to comprehend why people absolutely ADORE or LOVE this place...it really is not worthy.  Their sushi is OK, not spectacular but the price is right for the quality you get.  I like the ambiance, it's black tables with dimmer lights..so people look less ugly. Over all the place is good but far from great.  It gets great business but they are also serving  the huge crowd of white UF college students who think california rolls are sushi."
8/21/2006,3,A great casual pan-asian eatery by the Newberry movie theater.  Bento boxes and sushi are good dishes to try here.  One of the few places to have bubble tea.  Watch out for the service - the cashier/waiter has messed up mine and my friends' orders on multiple occasions.
10/22/2008,4,"Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat at a decent price. I wouldn't recommend going all out here on a dinner, but its got its value in my selection of restaurants."
7/7/2010,3,"For what it is (casual, affordable, and tasty) i give it 5 stars... I had a mexican sushi roll, which is tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese, and it was delicious...also had a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, pretty good. they have specials, and since i went on a tuesday, it was ""2-for-1"" teas. I went for thai iced tea...it's a pre-packaged tea, but nevertheless, tasted great. I'll be back when i'm in the area for work :)"
8/11/2011,4,"Great alternative when everybody wants to go to Moe's. I am not a huge fan of Moe'sbut will go here anytime. My friends and I always eat outside in between Moe's and Bento's have grown to call it ""m-entos"""
7/16/2012,5,This place was awesome.  The menu selection is not overwhelming but have tons of choices.  The food was authentic and very good.  My kids loved the soda dispensing machine.  It was a little costly but still very worth it.
6/25/2011,2,"I have eaten here three times. The first was horrible but I thought maybe it was just because they were busy, so I came back and it was decent, the third time was once again horrible. The rolls are sloppily rolled, the fish was tough and low quality. I have had better sushi at the grocery store- which is sad. It you want good sushi just spend an extra two bucks and go to a higher quality local, or just hit up Publix down the street."
8/19/2012,5,So delicious! Everything was great from service to the food and even the atmosphere! The decor is trendy and so cool looking. Very clean. Anything on the menu is great so don't feel too picky! Plus it's inexpensive for the amount of high quality food you get.
7/16/2006,4,"This place was one of the original pan-asian cafe's in gainesville.  They used to have something called a snow bowl (which was amazing), unfortunantly they no longer offer that for dessert (which is why they don't get 5-stars from me).  The food there is good and there is a wide selection of bento boxes, noodle bowls, rice bowls, and sushi selections.  The milk tea with pearls is excellent and if you are extra thirsty you can super-size it!.  I particularly enjoy the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup, Spice Chicken Noodle Bowl, and Curry Catzu Noodle Bowl.  Also they have the best hot and sour soup in town (the most authentic that I have tasted in gainesville)."
7/27/2007,4,"Eat here all the time. Both locations are fun, friendly, good selection of sushi and noodle bowls. Bento boxes are great value. I have never had a negative experience at either one.Love the environment...it's counter service, but friendly delivery ..."
7/27/2015,4,"Very tasty for a good price. Never had the sushi, but the spicy creamy chicken is my fave. Young staff can be a little testy, but overall good experiences there. Line can be very long so I'd call in your order. Not a ton of indoor seating. Still four stars for tastiness."
3/6/2008,3,"In the spirit of full disclosure, my girlfriend and my barber got violently sick after eating the vegetable noodle bowl and a bento box. This could be a fluke. That said, I still like this place.Generically very asian. Great place to bring kids or people who don't like foreign food. Not too pricey. Fare share of students hanging out but not obnoxious or greek."
4/10/2010,4,Great sushi at best price and ambiance. You can have a great sushi meal without going broke here. Always busy because of this.
7/30/2011,4,"Bento Blue (Archer Rd. is Bento Red):  awesome prices, fast and friendly service, big parking lot and no upcharge for spicy sauce!  They're hitting all the right buttons for an awesome place (unlike Bento Red).  Cons?  its small and dark inside.  The music is really loud.  Its sort of like walking into Hollister."
6/22/2009,1,"Well, my partner and I were quite impressed with the reviews we saw on here and being fans of oriental, vegetarian food decided to try it out. We were disappointed- for $8 the portion size was tiny (my partner had to get a meal at Taco Bell- unfortunately - because he was still starving! ) and not satisfying (and I'm not a big eater!) We ordered the box deal - Red Curry Tofu- and the tofu wasn't prepared in any special way just basically cut up and chucked into hot sauce (not even brazed or lightly cooked..) I would definitely recommend going to Chopstix instead if you want a good tofu dish. And the special 'sides' they give you in the box were minuscule as well with the salad being about two forkfuls and the beans just as much- good place to go if you are watching your portions!"
10/13/2011,4,"You know, I like Bento. I prefer Bento Blue (Newberry) to Bento Red (Archer), if only because the latter is often crowded and kind of unorganized.The sushi is pretty good (and pretty cheap), and the Boba tea (almond is my favorite -- with pearls, which are made of tapioca and make for a really interesting drink experience) is fantastic. I would probably go to Bento just for some Boba tea."
5/15/2015,4,"Love this place for a quick Asian cuisine. Not pricey, nice atmosphere. Sometimes they get really busy but that's because everyone in town loves them. The sashimi tuna is my favorite, comes with avocado which I love! Their udon noodle bowl is my second favorite."
11/23/2008,5,"I like this place a lot. I highly recommend the tea with the pearls in it. It's crazy, but good. I really enjoy coming here with friends because it has a modern feel and we all love our sushi! I look at it as a Panera Bread but a sushi place."
11/14/2010,3,Good asian fusion. Good lo mein. Fast-food-ish.
11/3/2014,5,My daily sushi go to. Can't beat the price for the quality sushi. Can get very busy so calling ahead and getting take out and sitting outside it a good idea. Daily specials too
2/1/2013,5,"I used to work in Gainesville and my co-workers and would go to Bento every Monday for lunch. Great food, great value, great restaurant. It's one of the few places I miss in Gainesville."
10/28/2014,3,"The food is great, but the service tends to be terrible. Borderline rude employees and slow service are the norm. If you call in a pickup order and they say 20 minutes, give it at least 30 and on occasion nearly 45 before you actually get your food. It's just frustrating and they never seem to acknowledge how slow they are."
12/24/2014,5,We love the food and service here and it is one of our regular places to eat.  I have been bringing my two children here since they were in utero and we've always had good service and felt welcome here.  I usually order sushi or bento boxes.  Love their seasonal selections.   Everything is cooked and seasoned right and their employees are nice.
2/22/2010,4,"Can't say enough good things about Bentos. Everything is good, from bento boxes to sushi to bubble tea. My only complaint is the parking and seating arrangements. Sometimes the place is so crowded that you can't find parking (not their fault mind you) and you get inside and there's no tables. Frustrating when you want Bentos!"
9/14/2012,5,"5 stars for sushi in its price-category. The consistency of Bentos is amazing- especially for the reasonable prices. I've probably eaten Bentos 100+ times- more pick up than eat-in. My favorite = gator roll (w/ side of spicy sauce), steamed dumplings, miso soup, and strawberry shortcake bobo tea with pearls- though some people prefer without pearls. As an aside, the staff seems really happy- like they have good camaraderie- I think happy people take more pride in their food."
11/11/2012,5,"Bento is always good!  I always get the same thing: Chicken Broccoli Rice Bowl.  I also get the blended ice teas and sometimes the miso soup.  The miso soup is great if you have a sore throat!  My hubby has made a habit of getting the spicy chicken noodle bowl, and I always steal a couple pieces of his chicken.There are 2 locations in Gainesville, and if I had to pick, I'd prefer the Bento Red on Archer Rd, only because of service.  The girls that work at Bento Blue on Newberry Rd just always seem stuck up to me, but Bento Red has always been nice.  Either way, the food here is so good that I won't discount Bento's rating because of Bento Blue's shortcomings.  The restaurant is in fact in the fast food category, and service at fast food places tends to lack compared to sit-down places anyway.Overall, Bento deserves 5 stars in my opinion, and I regularly eat dinner here."
7/18/2009,4,"This is a great place for lunch or a quick casual dinner.  Atmosphere is sort of techno-hip --- I much prefer to sit outside than inside that dark, noisy room.  But the lunchbox is a tasty ensemble that breaks out of the fast food mold.  Service is always polite and attentive.  Every entree I've tried has been delicious.  (The dining-hall dessert cake is sort of a joke however).  Prices are very reasonable.I have just one complaint, which is that TWICE I've been served stale, skunky beer.  I guess they have a mostly student crowd and they don't sell that beer very fast.  Skip the beer!"
7/8/2011,4,"I had a great time eating here, the large screen TVs make this location a great place to enjoy a football game while eating your food. The food itself is extremely well made and the portions are hearty. The selection of food and drink types is also very wide and well done."
7/3/2008,2,"If the concept of metropolitan Asia could manifest itself into a haze of some sort, fill a room, and shout at you, that would be fairly close to the atmosphere experienced here. But if you're unfortunate enough to be in this area, your other options are Moe's and Bonefish or some bullshit, so you may as well get some rice or something here."
12/29/2010,2,"I had heard great things about this place, so I decided to venture away from my favorite sushi place in town. Upon walking in, I feel like I am in a mad dream with a mix of my junior high school cafeteria, a techno bar, and a run down McDonalds. Upon entering, you grab a large laminated sheet which is the menu. Then you walk along a half wall to get to the register. You place your order (don't dare ask for any special sushi dish because they have never heard of things which aren't on the menu). You then go sit down. The tables are small, no booths and are stocked with only low sodium soy sauce. You then take your flimsy plastic cup to the drink dispensers (think Moe's with less space). Then you have the option to get sauces. Unlike Moe's cute little sauce bar, you are met with giant pump dispensers which don't work very well. The spicy mayo has way to much of a grocery store mayonnaise flavor. The eel sauce is also very plain. The sushi we ordered was brought to the table. All three rolls tasted very similar - each overpowered by the large chunks of cream cheese inside. The sushi rice was good, the eel was too warm, the shrimp tempura was above average. Oh, also, no coke products. We ordered a coke and a sprite and were given cups only to find Pepsi products after paying (blah!). I saw no Japanese people behind the counter. A decent fast food type joint if you don't mind the techno music playing along with sports on one tv and an Asian B movie on the other. Nothing exciting."
9/3/2010,2,For the price point it is a deal but the food isn't that good.  All the bento boxes disappointing you can get just about everything they put in it at a buffet. Like the little square cake.  The sushi is just average but hay it's fast food sushi style.  It might have been trendy when it first opened but over time those trendy thing become dated.  Not very clean most of the time.  I'll only go if I'm desperate for something to eat.
10/22/2012,4,"I think I've only eaten here twice or three times in person, but I've lost count of how many times I've ordered take out from here. Their Bulgogi Noodle Bowl is on of my favorites. It's not the best service, but the food is great. If you're hungry, don't be shy about hitting Bento up."
2/5/2011,4,Cheap sushi without really cutting the quality. Not the freshest but definitely better than publix sushi or the sushi bars at any chinese restaurant. You can't get much better for the price. Love to get the take out orders.
11/1/2013,4,"i'm really writing this for my wife. she is a big fan. we both like this corner since it has a nice variety of food options for us, namely moe's, coldstone, coffee culture, gators dockside and this place. i have also ate here a few times. the food is good, not the best sushi in town, but good. if you judged by the lines, people must find this place freakin' awesome 'cause it seems to almost always have a line. one thing my wife likes alot is their endless dispenser of spicy mayo sauce. they recently introduced a children's menu. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get."
