11/13/2022,5,Wow this place is def worth the 5 stars Food was delicious !!!Crunchy roll and pao pao shrimp was amazingly good !!!!  I def recommend coming here. Portions were big for the price.  So flavorful. Don't over think it and just come here. You won't regret it
11/27/2022,2,"After shopping, we tried this place and had a very disappointing experience.  The staff does not greet customers and you have to order on a tablet-like machine.We ordered the fried pork dumplings and veggie spring rolls.  Both tasted like they came from the freezer section at the grocery store.Minimal menu and no service whatsoever. We will NOT be back and do not recommend it."
12/3/2022,5,"Bento is BOMB!! I'm absolutely obsessed with Bento Asian Kitchen. I am a basic sushi lover. For the longest I would only eat California rolls. Now that Bento has come into my life I have ventured out of my comfort zone. Tonight I arrived at their poké bowl and I loved it so much. The ingredients at Bento are so fresh. Like SHIITake mushrooms how have I been missing this my entire life. Also, I was sick today and realized that this is the perfect meal when you need to put something in your stomach but cannot have lots of sugars or dairy. Fresh and filling."
4/27/2022,4,"I will say two things about this Bento location. 1. Their takeout is about the worse thing I have ever seen. I waited a full 30 minutes longer than I was told it would be for my takeout order. But, that actually holds true for all three Bento locations I've ever done takeout at. So, a word of advice, if you're ordering takeout from a Bento, tell them you want to pick up the food 30 minutes before you actually want it. I'm not kidding.2. Once you finally get your food, Bento has the best quick service sushi in the entire Central Florida area. I do not remember what rolls I got that day, but you can check the picture to see how bright and vibrant they look. All of the seafood tasted fresh and had a good texture. The sauces and herbs they used were not too much, and complemented flavors well. And the little crunchy things they put on that one roll were genius. Sushi roll's biggest lacking sometimes is texture, so these flavorless little balls of crunch were perfect. Overall, four stars is the perfect way to describe this place. Not perfect, but still amazingly delicious."
1/26/2022,2,"I'm going to start by saying I will never patron at any bento again. I don't remember what time we arrived but it took about 20 mins to get our food. There were other ppl waiting for their orders so it could've been a bit longer. By 10:30 they had turned off the lights in the entire place. We were still eating.The food was decent, the only reason I'm giving more than one star. They also offer beer, seltzers, & wine. I enjoyed the garlic string beans & miso soup. The rice & noodles didn't have much flavor. The spring rolls were greasy but I am glad they were veggie ones. The wontons could've been better. We asked for no avocado in our sushi roll. We sent it back but didn't want to wait for a remake. A bit pricey for the portions. The place seemed clean but overall not a good experience."
6/4/2022,4,"I often come to this Bento location because it's the closest to my place in Downtown Orlando but if I had to drive, I probably wouldn't come because of parking. I give it a 4 out of 5 for the parking, sometimes long waits for food/service and they do not accept cash.Sometimes when we have ordered to go and arrived well after the time they told us it would be ready, we would still have to wait 10-15 minutes.Other than that, everything I've had here over the many times, has been really good. My tried and true is the chicken teriyaki & sichuan rice bowl(s).I often opt for the Mt Fuji sushi roll and the Crunch signature roll as I am not a real sushi connoisseur."
4/11/2022,4,"I always enjoy bento and think they have good food. I haven't been to this location in years, but its good to see it made it through the pandemic! Centrally located in downtown and convenient. Quick service which is really nice. The food was good, although I would t recommend orange chicken and udon noodles, I couldn't make up my mind of what I wanted and this combination turned out to be very sweet. 4-star rating for this visit at this location because there were som dirty tables around that took a while to get cleaned off."
9/28/2022,4,"Got some solid takeout here one night and it was delicious! For a Japanese place, the Korean food hits different!"
2/9/2022,5,"I really enjoy this place for food. They have a good selection, but the menu is super easy to follow along and get what you want.Or you can try one of the main dishes, and they know what they are doing. The food came out really quick and was really hot. I was shocked at how fast they were with how busy this place was.This is a perfect place for a quick meal or to take your time and enjoy the food."
2/18/2022,5,"Mmm Bento! This is by far my favorite Bento locations throughout Central Florida. Came into the restaurant and our order was taken immediately. The staff was very attentive and busy! The establishment is clean but a little too crowded with furniture that it was an obstacle to get to the restrooms. Our order was taken, we sat down and our food took maybe about 20 minutes to come to the table. I don't mind the wait for food because that's an indicator that they're making it fresh. I ordered the chicken katsu Japanese curry, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken garlic broccoli noodles. The food was piping hot and so delicious! Definitely a place you should eat at when you're around town. The menu seems a lot simpler than other places, and I'm glad. Wish I took a picture of our food before we slammed it -- it was so delicious! This is the ONLY Bento place I'm going to!"
11/16/2021,3,"Cool vibe and great menu offerings. I ordered a create your own bowl and got to choose two bases, two proteins, five toppings, two small extras, and a sauce! And there were so many options within those options. I truly could customize it however I wanted and make it healthy for my eating style. My bowl was fresh and very yummy. I will say though, for the price, I thought the portion was very small. I got double salad as my base, and I could have sworn it looked like a single portion. I only got two pieces of cucumber and one slice of ginger, and they completely forgot my edamame. The fish pieces were pretty big but very few and far between.All in all, the vibe of the restaurant is cool and the food was tasty, but the portions left a hole in my wallet with me definitely wanting more."
9/2/2021,2,"I would give them one star for service.  They have a sign that says they are ""experience longer wait times due to covid and number of employees.""  Seriously?  I counted 4 people out in the service area and there must have been at least 1 cook.  I was the only person in the place and it took 20 min.  Ridiculous.  Food was good so they get 2 stars.  Step it up people."
4/27/2022,3,"Pretty good food, decent sushi, relatively fair price. Service is a bit on the slow side, but it's downtown...and a BIG negative for me... they don't accept cash...Found that out when I tried to pay. Who doesn't take cash? It's unheard of!  If they ever decide to take cash, I'll give them another star.Solid 3 stars til then."
1/10/2022,5,Wait time was pretty long but typical for a sushi restaurant delivery. Loved my food. Ordered through Ubereats. Will order from here again.
9/2/2022,3,Order from here frequently. A little pricy for the food but love the pad Thai. Ordered the poke bowl for a second time and the amount they give for the price ($19) is not worth it. Poke Hana has been the best for a poke bowl in the area.
8/27/2022,1,I asked for hoisin sauce and she was like we aren't Chinese and she was giving me a lot of attitude and I asked for a refund and she says we don't do that here and I was extremely turned off don't ever come here they have an extreme attitude. And seriously if the food was even good I would've restrained myself but unfortunately it wasn't.
2/27/2022,3,"The food was delicious and fresh! My daughter and I both ordered sushi rolls and we were extremely happy with our choices!! The waitress was not very friendly. When we asked where we could get napkins, she curtly pointed to the back area by the soda machine. Later, I asked if we could get a to go box and she again pointed back on the counter by the napkins and never offered to get them for us. She seemed very annoyed with our questions. Having never been there before, we had no idea. I'd go again though, the food was amazing!!"
11/30/2021,4,"(10/29/2021) the office pitched in for a DoorDash delivery for lunch. Got a Build-A-Poke Bowl, Garlic String Beans, Veggie Spring Rolls. It was kind of a dreary day, the food was fresh, on time, and the highlight of the day. Green beans were blistered from s quick fry, savory, garlicky, and tender.  Veggie Spring Rolls were crisp, moist interiors, not greasy.  I probably could've used more sauces for my poke bowl, but I'm also a condiment fiend.  Fish was the trim from other parts, like off the fillet, and pretty fresh, but not pristine (condiments help)."
1/20/2022,1,"Came here to grab a quick lunch to go before a meeting.  I clearly explained my gluten allergy and got help ordering.  I waited 25 minutes for my salad. When I got back to my office, I had fried chicken on it. FFS, I can't have gluten, which is in the breading and the fryer.  I took it back, and they nicely offered to remake it.  Where I waited another 30 minutes for a salad!  A simple GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD! I finally was able to eat 2.5 hours after I ordered the original salad, (to be fair I did have a meeting, and couldn't bring back the original salad until it ended), and it's just OK.  Nothing special, but it was $16!  I won't be returning."
4/14/2022,4,"Decided to stop in for a quick dinner and was not disappointed. I got the Coconut Red Curry chicken bowl with udon noodles; very good with a good variety of veggies! It had a good amount of spice, but just the right amount for me (I like moderate levels of spice). My girlfriend got the Orange chicken bowl with udon noodles. It was a little too sweet with the noodles, she would recommend it with rice instead."
5/30/2021,5,Glad they have this place as we were a bit hungry. A colleague and I came here for the first time. At first I was taken aback as you have to place your order upfront and then they'll serve it to you. You basically have to go get your own drinks...kind of self serve in a way. Not used to it but I don't mind a change. The service was incredibly fast and the food is actually very good. I would definitely dine here again. The staff were friendly and accommodating.
8/20/2022,3,"I have gone to this restaurant many times for lunch which is always awfully packed. Thankfully, they have the option to order pick up which helped save me time. I have had their lunch specials which include sushi that have been hit or miss. I hate that the prices have gone up and the food being subpar."
1/11/2022,1,I just ordered a small side of fried rice I showed up and it's was $8 which for the location and what I got was extremely high. It has zero flavor all the white sauce in the world couldn't help this rice it's safe to say I won't be back! On a side note ease up on the oil.
10/8/2022,3,"Usually good but... they didn't seem ready to operate. I arrived at the opening time of 12pm on Saturday. There was no ice at the drink station, tables didn't seem greatly cleaned, and took about 20 minutes to get my food. They seemed preoccupied with making a to go order that must have been called in before they opened. Fortunately the food did taste good by the time I got it."
12/5/2021,2,The food was not bad & expensive. I oreded delivery and they forgot to make half the order (didn't forgot to charge me though) when I called they acted like it was an inconvenience for them to fix their error.Don't recommend based on their customer service
3/11/2022,1,"I wish there was an option to rate this place 0 stars because I don't believe it's worthy of even 1 star! I visited this location on Sunday with my boyfriend and some friends. We all ordered our food and within about 5 minutes everyone's food started coming out, besides mine. So I wait another 15 mins go by, still waiting, my friend approached the staff to ask what's going on with my meal, he's told it'll only be a few minutes. Another 15 minutes go by, at this point everyone is almost done with their food. And I'm still waiting for mine, so I go ask the staff what's going on and how much longer it might take. Mind you this whole time they have been filling to go orders and new orders coming in left and right, yet I'm still sitting there 30 minutes later waiting for food! When the food finally arrives we asked the ""manager"" what took so long and she told us they took so long because they were making fresh noodles and filling to go orders. I take 1 bite into my General Tso chicken and noodle bowl to find cold soggy, excessively oily, bottom of the barrel, probably day old noodles! After making me wait more than 30 minutes for my meal they have the nerve to serve me disgustingly old noodles when this whole time they said the hold up was them making ""fresh"" noodles. At this point I don't even have an appetite because of how disgusted I am with their service and the quality of the food. I approached the staff to voice my concerns and was met with attitude from both the guy rolling sushi at the time and the ""manager"". I asked for a refund which they provided with a side of attitude of course. What she should have really done is taken care of the whole bill to compensate for their horrible service. There was no concern, no apology, no explanation, no effort to make things right. The ""manager"" was so annoyed to even be bothered with this issue. And I put the word ""manager"" in quotations because she may have held the title but she was far from what a true manager embodies. I would strongly suggest re training her along with your entire staff on what hospitality is.Please do yourself a favor and don't waste time or your money going here."
9/17/2022,5,Honestly I've never heard of bento until I started  working downtown. I've tried quite a few things but it's overall really great!!
10/18/2021,3,Food is great but service was bad. My children's food came out after I was done with my food. The cashier was new. He didn't know what size the portions were or if I cans substitute anything. I willLook for another place with great food instead of coming here.
5/5/2022,3,"This is a very convenient location for Downtown, but there are some things you should be aware of because it's not quite a ""normal"" Bento location. First, there are no boba-style drinks available--which is a shame, because I'd be here multiple times a week for those. Second, Happy Hour (buy-two, get-one-free sushi, BOGO beer, and free app with kitchen entree) is dine-in only, even though that's not advertised anywhere until after you order. Third, the portions are 10-15% smaller than regular Bento locations. Even though I live less than a block away, I choose the Winter Park Bento more frequently."
5/22/2022,1,"Was sitting outside with my meal and drink, got up to make a phonecall didn't want everyone to hear my conversation. Come back to my table and the worker had threw my food and drinks in the trash. I go inside ask the manager for a replacement not even a refund and she refused. It was about $35 worth of food and drink. Obviously customer service is not their thing."
11/2/2019,4,"I've been to quite a few locations of Bento, so it's high time I wrote a review. This one came in clutch for my and my crew after walking the streets of Downtown Orlando!You order as soon as you walk in the door and the food is brought to you. The food came out quite quickly and it did not disappoint. My food was not as hot as I would have liked this time around, but no serious complaints. The food tasted fresh and is always presented beautifully.Great spot if you are into Asian Fusion. Always a quality meal!"
2/25/2022,4,"The food was 4 stars, the atmosphere 3, so I rounded up from the 3.5 star average that this Bento location fittingly already has on Yelp.My husband, toddler, and I shared a Japanese curry chicken katsu bowl, a Korean tofu bowl (both with brown rice because we like denying ourselves pleasure), and a Florida roll.We were able to enjoy the perfectly-prepared bowls despite the echoey, crowded, and grimey atmosphere (and I know grimey - I have a toddler). The chicken and tofu were perfectly fried, the sauteed vegetables still nicely crisp, and the rice - well, despite it being brown, didn't detract. The Korean bowl wasn't too saucy or spicy (except maybe for the extremely spice-averse), and my husband found the Japanese bowl's green beans excellent. The Florida roll was a little light on the avocado, which it really could have used more of to offset the fish and cream cheese. And actually maybe a little more rice?The atmosphere was more fast-casual than I expected (that one's on me), but maybe class it up with something (environmentally) nicer than giant plastic cups for all beverages, at least for dine-in. My husband and I had to laugh at ourselves drinking sake out of a beer pong-sized plastic cup."
6/20/2021,5,Reasonably priced and consistently delicious sushi. We've always had great experiences in the restaurant and it's one of our reliable go-tos for take- out or delivery.
5/25/2022,5,The bento boxes are great! Great variety of options on the menu and well executed - I highly recommend.
1/22/2020,4,"*this review is based on pick up only*I've ordered from Bentos via their online portal and I really dig it! The menu is easily accessible, down to allowing you to ask for special requests for your order (though they mention it might not be acknowledged). Order has always been ready within 10 minutes which surely beats waiting in line and then waiting for your food afterwards. I'm always acknowledged quickly and have not had to wait more than 5 minutes for my order when I arrived. Still tasty & hot as if I was eating in the restaurant."
5/31/2022,5,This is a great place.It has good food and good Services. They are very clean and nice people.I recommend the garlic broccoli.
11/1/2021,1,I worked today 10/31/21. I went on break and got sushi.I'm now in the hospital because of food poisoning. Absolute worst sushi and even worse service. 0/10 would not recommend.
4/15/2022,2,"Usually their dishes are good. But today, I placed an order to go; sesame stir fry w/shrimp bowl at 2:26pm. Two young ladies ordered after me and received their meals around 10-15 mins after. I had to ask about my meal. I received it 20 mins later. The rice was pasty, no seasoning. JUST BLAND. Wasted $14."
9/20/2019,5,"Bento always delivers! Love the ambiance of this location very chic. I appreciate the consistency and flavors of Bento. Came on a Thursday afternoon and wasn't very busy. Parking can be a nightmare if you don't want to park in the parking garage. Had a bento bowl and the flavors were every bit of amazing. Will continue to frequent. Call ahead for take out, as certain times they get very busy. Metered parking around the corner."
9/15/2021,5,Love all bento locations! We order bento often and it's always delicious ! Many great options of food and teas
4/19/2018,1,"One question...what the heck happened to this place?!?! We are so disappointed. No more table service, they down sized their menu and got rid of a lot of items, the Udon soup had thin, flat noodles and the beef they used almost seemed like mutton. Yuck. Not at all what it should have been. The steamed chicken dumplings were thrown into a bowl and we were given a plastic to go container of the dipping sauce on the side. Food didn't even taste the same. It seems they are pinching pennies at this place wherever they can. We used to love coming here....not anymore. We won't be coming back again."
9/16/2019,4,"One of our favorite lunch spots.  You can smell the appetizing aromas from the street.  Lots of great vegetarian options.  You can have your choice of protein, sauce, veggies over rice or noodles, they have great bento boxes as well.  Another of my favorites are the sushi rolls and most recently the amazing poke bowls.  Very delicious, service is friendly and fast.  Seating is tight at lunch, and occasionally the orders are wrong, but still we love it."
3/11/2022,3,40 minutes and counting for two bento boxes. There are 5 tables with a total of 16 ppl here. It's completely dead.
4/6/2018,4,"Walked past this cafe on my way to walk for the premiere of Orlando Fashion Week 2018, it smelled delicious, which caused me to do a double-take on catching their name. I ended up walking the same path back to my car and smelled the same deliciousness on my return trip. That was my queue that I needed to have dinner there, instantly. After walking in, I checked in on Yelp and noticed they had 400 reviews while sitting at a 4 star rating... that's pretty darn good for me! Let's sushi! On top of that, I received an instant coupon (from checking in) for a free appetizer. For a little café, on a Friday night, the seating was quick! The wait staff pretty swift! And the food was tasty! I ordered, steamed chicken dumplings for my appetizer $FREE; the 4 piece ""Cali"" Sushi $3.50; and the Fried Rice Bowl with Chicken $8. Washed down with a delicious Angry Orchard $3.50It doesn't seem as if that was much but, the portion size of the rice bowl was HUGE more like a deep bowl. I will be returning again... and again... and again when I am back in town."
2/25/2020,4,"Came here for dinner with my husband, service was great, a lot of options on the menu. I ordered Szechuan Chicken bento box and my husband got Pao Pao chicken with Lo Mein noodle bowl. The flavor is great, I would hope the Szechuan chicken can be more spicy but I guess it caters to American taste. Pao Pao creamy sauce was good but a bit too much on the noodles. It would also be nice if they can add more vegetable varieties to the dishes instead of only having steamed broccoli. Bento box was $11 and the bowl was $10, the portion may be a bit small if you came in with an empty stomach. A nice place overall, will come back again to try the sushi box."
5/30/2021,5,"I especially love the tofu and fried rice. The service is fast and friendly, and the prices are good."
6/12/2021,1,"The chicken pad Thai I got was good here but my sister in law ordered a sushi combo box and a gnat came flying out of the container! We ordered for delivery. After calling the restaurant about the situation just to give them a heads up, they offered a free one to replace it. All I had to do was give them my name. When I tried to get the replacement they offered, I was turned away because nobody recalled the offer."
6/19/2017,4,"4 stars for a solid downtown Asian restaurant.I've been to Bento a few times with various people. Located in the Plaza on Orange Avenue next to Mochi and the theater, Bento is a standard Asian restaurant that offers sushi and various rice or noodles + flavored meat combinations.When you arrive, you walk through the door and immediately get into line to order at the counter. Bento has menus off to the side for you to use to order, and the servers bring out your food once it is ready. The interior is fairly clean and modern with techno music playing in the background and a sushi counter looking out to the dining room.When it comes to picking food, you can either order a roll or put together a bowl or box. I usually get the bento box if I'm hungry or he noodle bowl if I just want a snack. The latter comes with ginger salad, a fun dessert, string beans, and noodles/rice with your meat (I like the orange, but they have several good flavors). Priced at around $10 (which gets you a free appetizer as a Yelp check-in deal), it's probably the best combo to get.Overall, Bento is a solid downtown Asian restaurant. The nice interior, good standard Asian food selection, and good deals makes this one of the better (non-sushi) Asian spots in Downtown Orlando."
8/8/2021,4,"This place is hidden. The food was delicious. I had the chicken stir fry rice bowl and fried pork dumplings. The restaurant was clean. Staff friendly. I tried to pay in cash and they wouldn't accept it. You have to use a credit card. Apple Pay, etc. You have to grab a menu at the door when you walk in. Order at the register. They will prompt you for a tip. Just FYI, you seat yourself, get your own drink from the cooler or fountain, you have to go get your napkins and plastic utensils from the back of the restaurant. They bring your food and never come back. No glass of water. I only received half my order. When I was done with my rice bowl I had to go back to the register to inquire about my dumplings. I'm not sure what the tip is for since there is no service. Same deal as Panera. But the food was great and the portions were ver good. I don't agree with this asking for a tip before you get your order and when you have to serve yourself.  You don't get a tip just because you show up for work."
7/8/2019,4,"Good sushi however the Yaki Udon is way too salty. I had to ask them to remake it using less sodium/soy sauce/salt. Way too much salt. Prices are very reasonable and clean interior restaurant.However, don't expect to get any service at all. They bring out your food and never check up on you again. If you need napkins, you have to walk all the way to the cash register for that. If you need a refill on your drink, you have to walk over to the drinks yourself. I wouldn't tip them much."
5/27/2019,3,"I decided to come to downtown Bento location due to convenience for me. I ordered the Szechuan Shrimp with veggies & rice and received a free appetizer for checking in on the yelp app. I chose the wontons. Service: The line was literally out the door. It took about 10 mins to reach the front register. It took about another 15 mins to receive my food. The place was packed shoulder to shoulder. So seating was hard to find, especially if you're in a larger party. Food: I received my wontons about 5 mins before my entree came out. The wontons were more on the crispy side but were delicious with the sauce that came with it. The entree came out hot and steamy! As far as the taste of the food, it was very generic. I felt like I could have randomly chose a random Szechuan sauce from the shelf and had better if not equivalent. The shrimps were nice and juicy and the lunch portion was pretty good in size.. it could easily been separated into 2 meals. Parking: so you have to park in a parking garage and Bento will validate your parking .. just know they only take off $2 and NOT the entire parking fee."
3/1/2019,4,"I'm surprised I have not reviewed Bentos before. This place is the place to thank for my love for sushi. It was my first sushi spot I ever went to. I've been to their location in Dr Phillips as well. The servers are always friendly. This visit I actually checked in and got free wontons! They came out a little over friedand the server had no problem to bring them back. He even stood by while they made fresh ones. It's a nice ambiance. I have since explored several sushi places,and I still enjoyed Bentos!"
12/21/2020,4,Haven't been here in awhile since covid started.the time to get food was slower than the times before but we still enjoyed it.
6/11/2020,4,Love the food but every time we order off yelp there seems to be an issue. Either they can't find it or it takes an additional 30 minutes for our food to be ready.
2/2/2019,4,"Came to Bento with a big party and they were accommodating once most of the party arrived, which is normal. The place is pretty small but clean, and it is downtown, so not a big deal. It was my first time there and the menu looked great. Our server recommended some dishes and I opted for the pineapple chicken with white rice. It came out hot and you could tell it was real white meat chicken, with a tangy pineapple sauce. It was good, not great, not as flavored as I thought it would be but they gave you ALOT of food and it was affordable. I had so much leftovers! Other people in the party ordered their bento boxes, which looked amazing. Next time I will definitely order that. The customer service was excellent and I would be back again and recommend."
5/5/2020,3,"Bento used to be one of my favorite casual restaurants in Orlando due to their large menu and all of the varieties they have. I've been ordering from this restaurant for years, but I've realized that their prices continue to go up while the quality of their food has been decreasing tremendously. My favorite items were the sushi combo box (rainbow roll, mount fuji roll or special mexican with a side of white sauce) and the sriracha garlic chicken with noodles. Last time I ordered, the rolls were extremely small and the chicken was soggy."
1/19/2020,5,Absolutely delicious rolls!  Great little spot downtown to grab a bite and sooth  your sushi roll cravings. Excellent quality. Creative taste combinations. Friendly service. OnE of the best rolls we've ever had.
2/16/2017,3,"Let's start with the good, if you check in with Yelp you can get a free appetizer! They have happy hour from 3-6 from Monday to Friday. The restaurant is rather small so it's difficult to walk around if they place you in a middle table and your basicly sitting with your neighbor.I tried this out with some of my friends for the first time. I was late as always...I can't help it I'm Italian, it's in my blood! Haha. All of my friends already had their food when I got there. I ordered the free app to start, the pork egg rolls. They were good but nothing to rave about. As always when I'm with a group I have a hard time ordering. I decided to opt for the poke bowl with tuna since it had mango and I haven't had mango in forever. So as you know the dish is mostly just cut up cold items since its sushi but it still took them around 25 minutes to finally bring over my dish. Oh and the best part there were only a few small pieces of mango. I'd say an okay experience but I don't think I'd revisit."
7/22/2017,4,"I have been coming to Bento since I moved here to Florida 3 years ago. I worked downtown and this location is in the heart of downtown. Its easily accessed by any club or business downtown.Bento is my go to for a quick meal. I love sushi and the sushi they serve is always delicious. They have many different options of asian food, and the most popular combo is the bento box. It comes with 8 pieces of california, and 2 other rolls of your choice at 4 pieces each!I had a little mishap my last visit, they messed up my order and forgot my appetizers. The manger was apologetic and gave me a $10.00 valture for the next time I visit. I will continue to come to this location and any Bento around the Orlando area!"
4/5/2019,4,"I came here about a week ago with a friend and decided to try it for the first time, the food was good, I don't have any complaints. I would come back on a regular day for lunch"
12/4/2018,4,"I love this chain!What did I getI got the Regular sized build your own poke. I got it with double Salmon (Yes, I love salmon. Got spicy and regular. For the base, you can pick white or brown rice or spring mix, I got the greens. With the regular you can pick 3 different add ins and also 3 toppings with 2 sauces. I got mine with nori, jalapeños, wonton crisps, masago, fried onion.EnvironmentThis location is right downtown by the Cobb Theatre. It is relatively big for its location but can get very crowded during lunch time. I was there around 12 and it got packed.Niceness of the StaffDespite being busy, the staff was very nice. I was able to make my order in a timely manner and the order was brought out to me quickly. I asked for wasabi and they brought it to me quickly! Nice staffDollarThe regular boba was $11. Very reasonably priced.Yes?I love bentos! It is my trusted quick asian chain I love.#WendyWanders"
1/4/2019,4,"Consistent and a downtown Orlando lunch staple. Since I switched jobs to an office downtown, Bento has become a regular spot for me to grab a quick, affordable bite to eat. FOOD: Japanese/Asian cuisine. I usually order off their sushi menu, but in the event I am not feeling like it, I know their restaurant-side food is still good. Bento offers a wide variety of food. Their menu has two sides to it! If anything, their food is also very consistent and rarely do I have issues with the order itself.ATMOSPHERE: Fast casual. I wouldn't come to Bento for an intimate date, especially during the lunch hour where the line stretches through the dining area. You order and grab a table before the servers bring you your food.SERVICE: It is usually good, but every once in a while, I get someone who is completely clueless (so I chalk it up to them being new) or just apathetic about getting the orders brought to you timely. For example, a friend, who had ordered before me, got their meal after me because the server running the food did not check the window. Our sauces came out wrong too, but thankfully, that was an easy fix.Like I said, I come here pretty frequently, so Bento, please don't change.TIPS:- Get to Bento before 11:45 a.m. on weekdays to avoid a hefty lunch line.- Check in on Yelp for a deal.- Coca Cola products are served here."
1/31/2017,4,"Whenever I go to bento I am never disappointed. They have the best rice bowls, or sushi! I recommend picking either or because if you get both your bill will be a little higher than usual- and you will be stuffed!!! I love their sweet and sour chicken with white rice and you can never go wrong with any type of sushi. I always end up taking my rice bowl home because it is a lot of food. For the price you pay, id say the amount of food you get is fair! I will be back here soon to get my sushi kick!"
12/8/2019,5,"Their food was very tasty and fresh, I tried the soy poke sauce on a tuna poke bowl and it was very well balanced  with the rest of the bowl, I can't wait to try more of their menu. The young lady at the register was very nice and polite and asked all the right questions to get our order right, we were very happy with our bowls and will be coming back next time we are in the area The atmosphere was very upbeat, I wish we had had a chance to stay but had to travel and were there just to return our rental car."
1/2/2019,4,"I love this spot i used to come here a lot back in my Glory college days. It's a great spot to grab something to eat before going to the movies, or bar hopping. The food is pretty inexpensive and absolutely delicious. The staff is always willing to help and seem to be very knowledgeable. Bento is always our first choice when we are in downtown Orlando"
3/11/2019,5,"Love this place! It's fast, food service, tasty sushi, and good affordable prices! Favorite rolls are the special Mexican, Mt. Fuji, and dragon fly!"
12/9/2019,4,Bento has a good selection of bowls and are reasonably priced. The Korean chicken noodle bowl was good. Portion sizes are good. Lunch at Orlando downtown location can be crowded depending on the lunch time rush. Always a good go to for sushi and noodle bowls.
7/2/2018,3,"Ate here twice with my friends after rehearsals. Both times we sat in the booth against the long window since we were a group of 5-8 depending on the time. The food is cooked to order, the veggies are fresh and the rice is good. I ordered the Broccoli garlic beef the first time and a noodle dish the 2nd, both times the food was fast and delish!"
1/5/2019,3,"***Update: The management followed up about the experience, which I really do appreciate. The food was OK. The regular udon noodles are the best thing to have in a bowl. The two stars mainly come from The customer service because it was below par honestly. I called ahead, and they didn't put the order in until I got there 20 minutes later. Additionally, they got the order wrong. They did apologize, but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth unfortunately. I usually enjoy going to Bento, so it might have been a one-time thing."
7/6/2020,5,Love the fried rice and the cream cheese rangoons they were always great no matter the location
10/11/2019,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOOOVE This is on my top 5 fave places to eat. The bento box is the best option. My faves are the Bulgolgi and the Yellow or Red Curry. Their sushi is also AMAZING. highly recommend the TNT roll. Great food at great prices. Can't go wrong here.
8/11/2016,4,"I have now been to Bento twice... once for lunch and once for dinner. The first time I went, I was able to try an assortment of sushi. Myself and two co-workers each got a roll and split it all the way around. Some sushi was better than others, but everything was very good. I will go ahead and admit that I am being a bad Yelper and not remembering what rolls I have tried. But with any sushi, if I don't do a picture and caption then, it is lost on me looking back. For a lunch place, it is a great spot to stop in and get sushi. The atmosphere didn't feel as much that way for dinner. Maybe it was the really close quarters or maybe the rowdy group next to us downing the sake special like it was penny beer night. But not exactly what we were looking for a night of sushi with just my wife and me. The sushi was still very good and I would not be opposed to coming back. But if I am looking for a nice, relaxing dinner, we might try somewhere else. They still get the 4 stars because the food is worth coming in for."
11/4/2019,3,"Quick, convenient spot downtown to satisfy some Asian food cravings. I love its variety especially for when you're in a big group or don't know exactly what you're craving til you get there. The bento box is good if you can't decide even when you get there. It has salad, a carb, your choice of meat, and a couple pieces of sushi. It's your classic fast food Asian place - not the highest quality but still satisfying."
10/20/2020,3,Stopped by for a quick meal with my brother. This was my first time there. The food was decent. I found it a bit expensive for what it was and for the fact that it's cafeteria style. The veggies were good but the pasta was cold. Don't think I'll go back there.
3/30/2021,3,The venue is always kept nice and neat. The food and prices are good. The wait time isn't long even when they are busy during lunch.
8/11/2019,5,I usually get one of their bowls with Pao Pao sauce which is a creamy spicey sauce which is great on chicken or shrimp.   Their edamame is tasty with Garlic being my favorite.   Poke bowls are a solid choice here as well and the fish as always been fresh. It can be tricky to find as the main entrance is in the hallway under the movie theatre when going from orange ave towards the parking garage/entrance to the Solaire.  It is on the east side of the Plaza building.Yelp PRO TIP: as of this writing they have a FREE appetizer with every check-in!
8/20/2018,5,I can't believe I've never left a review for Bento! I am a check in regular and love this place. I love that they offer a free appetizer when you check in. The food is always consistently delicious and for the location the pricing is very affordable. I love going here after the movies and sometimes come in for lunch. I've even ordered delivery and my orders are always very accurate. I always order the special Mexican roll with bento fried rice with steak and shrimp. The bento box with spicy cream chicken is another favorite and I have trouble choosing between them. Bento is a franchise but still a local franchise and I love it!
8/22/2021,1,I used to love you guys but for some reason you don't take cash anymore. Which is weird I work downtown at a busy place and we take cash but you are definitely losing customers for not taking cash if you fix that you might be busier
7/26/2016,4,"Chain restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Everytime I go there I get something good and I try something else that I want to get next time. Curry (yellow) Katsu great, sweet spicy cream really good!!The service is good and I love the vibe plus they get your food to you in a timely fashion. Good prices as well."
4/12/2018,5,"I don't know if I'm giving this place 5 stars because they have out-frigging-standing customer service or the food or both. First, I walked into the restaurant and I was seated in a nice comfortable booth. I noticed they had about ten or so people working the floor. You have an assigned waiter / waitress, but if you even look like you have a concern someone is bolting over to offer their help. I'm going to be honest it impressed me - a lot. This man saw a confused look on my face and asked if he could help. He recommended certain items and explained the pricing. His recommendations were spot on and I was glad I ordered the item he suggested. I was quite hungry and my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Later, I was considering ordering an additional item and I expressed concerns with my waitress that I might be ordering too much. She honestly agreed that the size of the rolls were going to be too big for me to finish other items. I was so impressed with her honesty most waiters try to get you to order as much as possible to increase their tip, but their waitress Kimberly was fair and honest - I love it!The general atmosphere of this place is awesome. You can go alone like I did, bring a date or a friend or your family. The seating is comfortable enough that you can box your kids into a booth and have a good dinner without them running off.I like this place. I love their customer service.Their sushi is above average especially for Orlando.They have spicy mayo most places in Orlando do not. The prices vs portion size is excellent!"
7/30/2019,5,"Love this bento box style! Wish we had this place in California. Choose your choice of meat then pair to a dish and it comes with side dishes (rice, salad, and chow menu). I have got to say their kung pao chicken was the best out of what I have tried besides my red curry beef."
11/27/2017,4,"Pretty great spot that was close to the air bnb we stayed. We liked how the way to order is similar to Pei Wei. I ordered the Mongolian Steak Rice bow with white rice. Fresh crisp veggies and tender meat, but I get the flavor lacked something. I still enjoyed my dish though. The crab wonton appetizer is like at any other place, but the dipping sauce is spicy vs the typical sweet n sour kinda sauce. The interior is pretty with the lights that have grey or black threads hanging down from the lights. The tables seem a bit too close together and would be difficult to maneuver through. So definitely get a booth if you can. They had pumpkin wontons too, but I think it may only be for a limited time for the fall season. I'd like to come back and get sushi next time!"
10/16/2017,4,"Timing is everything.  This place is quite popular with our friends and the one thing we all agree on is TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  You can come here at the right time and you'll buzz through the line.  You can come here at the wrong time and it will take forever.If you work, live, or play downtown a lot you will figure it out for Bento Café fairly easily.My wife's favorite here is their poke.  The location is convenient (especially if you're hitting a movie at Plaza or are downtown for lunch) and the prices are fairly reasonable.  The quality of the food is good and the service is solid.It is one of the better Asian downtown restaurants."
9/8/2019,5,"I loveeeeee Bento! To be honest I live within walking distance from my apartment to this location and probably come 2 times a week with my boyfriend. What we both like about it is the consistency; every time we go the staff is friendly (one of the girls at the register knows my order  as soon as I come in), the food is always fresh and the orders come out quick. The special mex roll is the best sushi I've ever had and the General TSO box is my boyfriend's favorite. I took my mom here from Tampa and she is obsessed and is patiently waiting for the Tampa location to open. I would give Bento 5 more stars if I could!"
8/27/2019,4,"Nice lunch spot if you are in the mood for a quick sushi/ noodle, poke or bento.  Very busy and popular. I enjoyed what I ordered but I'm more traditional sushi person. I did order build a poke bowl with Salmon, but I'm not a big poke fan. I do recommend if you are on a budget and short on time. You won't be disappointed. Lots of menu options."
8/3/2018,4,"I love Bento! I've always gone here for one main goal. To devour a spicy chicken bento box! I have had the sushi and I do appreciate it but the spicy chicken bento is so good that I literally never deviate from that order. This Bento is located under the Cobb theater in the heart of downtown! It's pretty convenient if your watching a movie. The service is quick and everyone is really nice. This is a downtown location so it is a little noisy. The bathrooms and insides were clean and I did appreciate that. I know it's hard, especially downtown. The bento box is what I always get so that is what I'm going to review, with the exception of two appetizers that I ordered last time, the crab rangoon's and the pork egg rolls. Bento boxThis comes with a scoop of white rice, lo mein, ginger salad, dessert crisps in the middle (with a sweet drizzle of what seems to be condensed milk), and of course, the main protein choice. Here's the thing, the spicy chicken isn't even spicy. Just delicious, hold the spice. It does come with pepper bits, both red and green scattered throughout. I eat everything because it's all so good. The spicy cream sauce is sweet and tangy, it just distinguishes itself as a good flavor that isn't replicated well. The chicken is crisp and the all white meat inside is begging to be eaten! The crab rangoon's were very good. Sweet but not to sweet. The pork egg rolls I liked a lot. They were very crisp and the veggies inside were steaming! The sauce included was very tasteful as well. Overall, another good experience at Bento! If your spending at least $10, which usually you will, be sure to check in on yelp for a FREE appetizer!"
8/18/2015,4,"I must say I was surprised, I really enjoyed this place. My friends and I stopped by Bento Cafe after the Margarita Fest. The location is great, it is close to almost everything downtown.There was not a long wait for a Saturday night, which was a positive thing for our party of 4. I liked the fact the menu had a wide selection of food for sushi lovers and non sushi lovers. So if you don't like or do not want to have sushi you can order a Bento box which consist of your choice of wok stir fry rice (plenty to choose from), ginger salad and string beans. I ordered the chicken garlic soy Bento Box and it was good. I was also able to redeem a yelp offer because of checked in an ordered the fried chicken dumplings.I had an overall great experience; the service was on point and definitely recommend this place if you are downtown and want to grab a quick bite."
6/7/2019,3,"2.5 stars upped to a 3. Used to be my go to spot. However I think I have had my last meal there.Brought a group of friends out of tradition. But downsizing to fast casual really takes the experience down a few notches. Average food and zero service. A downgraded experience for sure. Plenty of sushi places if you're looking for a good meal. If you're looking for a quick lunch, maybe? If you're looking for a nice dinner, this is not the spot."
3/25/2019,1,"I live DT and this place used to be my go-to. Ever since they went to self-service (without changing the prices) it's just no longer worth it. They could get away with mediocre sushi if the service was good, but standing in line and ordering, taking a plastic number to your table... hard to justify spending money here. The line on the receipt for a tip is an insult. As a principle I tip 25% or better, but asking for a tip before you've had food or service is gross.I ordered a poke bowl, a roll, some hot sake, and the ""matcha minis"" (a desert). First to show up at the table was the desert, then the bowl. 20 minutes later the roll, and had to ask twice for sake. Service is abysmal, food is mediocre. You are losing customers over your greed."
9/25/2019,5,"The place have good menu selection, friendly stuff and fast service. Food is tasty, the portion size is good for the price. Poke bowl (you can build yourself and chose the size of the meal) is my favorite there."
10/9/2020,1,"We used to love this place, have been customers for years but lately the service has been terrible.  We just picked up food here and asked specifically for silverware and the snarky dude who waited on my husband smiled and said, why yes, there is silverware in the bag.  We were not going home so we got to eat with our fingers.  This was after my husband had trouble with his Apple Pay and the same dude looked at him and said ""you know there is an app for that"" like he was ignorant.  You would think that at a time when many restaurants are dying customers would least expect to be treated like this but I guess not.  Go to another Bento, I can almost guarantee you will be treated better."
12/19/2019,3,"We were referred to Bento by a lot of locals - overall, the food is good. It isn't great but it's not bad. That being said, I ordered the Wok Fried Rice with Shrimp. I added hot chili oil to give it that extra flavor. Next, I ordered the Hot Lava and Bamboo rolls. I wasn't that impressed but it's good."
8/15/2015,4,"Sushi was great--5 star! Service was lacking--2 star. Luckily the food was good enough to over rule the poor service (and hopefully it was just our server who was bad).Definitely come during their happy hour (3-6pm) because their special is amazing-- buy 2 rolls get 1 free (or something like that). They have standard sushi roll selection. We ordered caterpillar and spider rolls which were both fairly tasty. They also have sushi bowls with sashimi, rice, avocado, cucumber, and seaweed. We created our own bowl with salmon, tuna, and krab (imitation crab meat). Definitely recommend getting the salmon!"
9/14/2017,1,"Vegans & Vegetarians DO NOT EAT HERE! IHad ordered a tofu bento box and they had pieces of meat mixed in my veggies and tofu. I told the waiter and he said he was going to tell the manager, but noone came to apolognize nor offer another plate. I will never eat here again nor recommend this place to ANYONE. DISAPPOINTED."
4/30/2020,5,My go to for fast sushi in Orlando. It's always tasty and delicious. Great presentation and fast service. My two faves are the Mt. Fuji and Special Mexican. Love their Pao Pao chicken too!
8/24/2019,5,"This is my absolute favorite sushi place! I've only ever come during lunch, but the Sushi Bento Box is so satisfying and delicious, even when you get take-out. The sushi is fresh, tasty, well made and I always enjoy every bite!"
3/3/2017,4,"Anyone who knows me, knows my love for Asian food. Went out to the magic game tonight and decided to stop by Bento since it is near the Amway center. It has been a long time since I've been here but remember how much I enjoyed their food. I'm glad I did because it's just as good as I remembered it. To start off we ordered a Mexican roll as an appetizer. It came cut in 8 pieces and we split it between the both of us. It was delicious. The inside was warm and the cream cheese blended perfectly with the tempura shrimp. Add some eel sauce and it was delicious. I checked my yelp app and checked in and to my surprise had a free appetizer with 10 dollar purchase. They don't have many options but we decided on the krab rangoons. They were just fried when they got to the table so they very a little oily but flavor wise they were OK. They have many different options for entrees. You can either do a rice or noodle bowl with choice of meat ( chicken, beef, shrimp) or you can do a Bento box which brings rice, noodles, green beans, salad and your choice of protein. It literally comes in a box that has little dividers for each food. We both decided on getting the Bento box. I ordered the orange chicken and my girlfriend ordered the schezwan chicken. My box was delicious. I'm not a fan of green beans so I didn't touch those ( should of asked if I was allowed a replacement). The rice and noodles were perfect for my orange chicken. If I wanted to be picky I could of used less orange sauce on my chicken. Seemed to be a lot of it and it was very flavorful. The noodles went well with the chicken and so did the white rice. Salad had ginger dressing which tasted very refreshing. The schezwan chicken could have used more chicken as a lot of it was vegetables. My gf also complained that it had too much sauce. Overall we had a delightful experience. For 9 dollars per Bento box you get a lot of food and have the option of so many different types of meat. 2 Bento boxes, an appetizer, 1 sushi roll and 2 drinks all came out to $29.00 which in my eyes is a good deal. Make sure to redeem the free appetizer coupon!!"
3/7/2017,4,"Bento is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown.  I've been coming here since 2012.  Bento is conveniently located in the heart of downtown under the movie theater. You can basically make any entree a combo ($3 up-charge) which includes a drink and a salad, edamame, or miso soup. I rotate between a Bento box, the orange chicken rice bowl, and the  and tuna poké bowl. If you're starving, go with the bento box; it's very filling. The orange chicken has good flavor but the breading is heavy. My chicken gets a little soggy after a while. Make sure if you go with the Poké bowl you get a side of the teriyaki sauce -- perfect sweet and salty sauce."
7/16/2019,1,"Came to this place at lunch, what a disappointment the food was horrible, the noodles were cold the rice was under cooked, the chicken tasted horrible extremely sweet and cold as well. Ask for the free appetizer that they offer with Yelp check in, they refuse to honor it. They don't even have napkins on the table. Zero customer service. This is one of the places in downtown Orlando with four stars that are terrible. Not coming to this place in the future. With so many choices I don't find a reason to eat at this restaurant."
9/8/2020,1,"Are you serious tables are disgusting no ones cleaning them, food takes forever and get this the foutain isnt working but you can buy a $2.00 can of soda i cant even deal with the horrible service its no wonder all the concepts are closing that they own"
7/3/2017,5,Update....   We went back to have some Sushi last night.  Everything we ordered was super good.  Our waitress was nice.  We were very satisfied w/our experience here. Very reasonable price and fresh fish! Their ginger salad is pretty good! I love their Kawaii rolls!  And of course their create your own bowl is super good! Thank you to Tammy for your support!
11/17/2019,1,"This place has changed for the worst unfortunately. There's no more table service so you have to order at the register. They used to have some decent wine now they only have Pinot noir and Moscato. I mean who drinks Moscato!! And that's there only white wine option!! Also they don't have booster chairs anymore only high chairs, the hot sake was barley warm, also all the soy sauces at the tables were about empty. I am over this place. Bye Felicia!!!!"
10/29/2018,5,Where do I even begin!!! I absolutely love this place the location is perfect and the food just delivers every time. I went to lunch here on Saturday and I enjoyed myself. I was craving Asian food and and I was downtown so this was perfect. I like the ambience of the restaurant and surprisingly it wasn't too crowded. During lunch you order at the register then grab a number and choose your own seat which I like doing that anyway. I have the bangin bento fried rice which shrimp! And let me tell you the shrimp were not no baby shrimp these were juicy big shrimp which gave the rice soo much flavor!! Ok so I was really hungry so I ordered more lol I also also had the miso soup which was perfect! Also I ordered the fried pork dumplings which were crispy the way I like and juicy inside. Wait I'm not done! I also ordered the spicy tuna rolls which were put together small and cute the way I like I can't stand big sushi rolls that fall a part so they nailed it!! I loved all my food and I am looking forward to my next visit!
1/21/2017,4,"My husband and I frequent this place on our lunch breaks.When you walk in there are laminated menus to your right. They offer sushi rolls, lunch specials, rice and noodle bowls and some traditional appetizers.Once you decide what you want you order at the counter and pay.  If you choose to dine in they will give you a number to place on your table.  You get to pick where you'd like to sit. They have a fountain drinks all the way in the back, where you can find extra napkins, to go containers and forks.   They also offer beer and specialty drinks in the front to the left of the counter.This place is a great option for a quick bite.  Just keep in mind, if you order sushi it does take longer to come out than if you were to order a rice or noodle bowl.There have been many occasions where my husband got his rice bowl about five minutes before I got my sushi."
12/8/2018,3,"Went here on a cold day, ordered soup with beef in it. It was very flavorful, but didn't really have any vegetables in it. It would have been nice to have some bok choy, more bean sprouts, maybe some bamboo, or some other greens in it. Other than that. It was good."
6/21/2016,4,"Let's just skip right to the important part: The chirashi bowl is $11.95.That's right ladies and gentlemen, there exists a place smack in the middle of downtown Orlando that offers a chirashi bowl for $11.95, when the vast majority of restaurants charge somewhere in the range of $16 to $25.  Now I know what you're thinking, ""Yes but surely this 'chirashi bowl' is filled with... like, Cheerios and string cheese."" Not so!In the interest of full disclosure, one can safely (and correctly) assume that this chirashi bowl may not be as good as some of those high priced works of art. But it's got all of the basics!  Good, fresh fish: tuna, escolar, salmon, yellowtail, two pieces each. A couple of pieces of fake crab meat, shrimp, and several slices of cucumber and avocado. All of this on top of a bed of sushi rice with a little seaweed salad in the corner.It's not as big as some of the chirashi I've had, and it's not as adventurous as some others. But it's a good, basic chirashi for a totally reasonable price."
11/5/2016,5,"Got off a cruise and came over for some happy hour sushi and bentos box. It was just right. Bogo on beer and wine, pick 2 signature rolls and get a classic roll free. The portions were filling and the sushi was presented nicely."
5/5/2016,3,"Why 3 stars? Because this was definitely a prototypical average experience.   ---   ---   ---This is what 3-star reviews were made for. A bunch of co-workers and I gathered here for a lunch during a conference. Put a bunch of Yelp CM's in a room, and you're likely to get one helluva of a family-style, sharing experience. And share we did, with too many sushi rolls to count.The only draw back to family-style sharing, is the chaos of food flying at you from every direction, which makes it tough to pen a review with a ton of specifics. Here's what I know - maybe one roll out of the several that I tried was pretty good. The rest ranged from eh, to meh. How's that for a scientific explanation?I can understand patronizing here if you have an office nearby and are craving sushi for lunch, but I can't personally see going out of my way to return, to be totally honest."
2/16/2019,4,Went in for a quick bite since everything else in the area was closed (2pm on Saturday). Ordered a mini poke bowl. Everything was good and was a great portion for a quick lunch.
12/4/2019,4,"The restaurant is kinda hidden downtown but I've found it twice!!! Both times the food was amazing!!! Only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is lacking. They don't seem enthused to be working here, and we were a table of 4, everyone received their food one at a time except for me. I had to wait an additional 15 min for my food and I wasn't told why I had to wait, by the time I received my food, the rest of my table was almost done eating. I would have preferred if someone told me the reason why I was waiting for so long. I will return because the food was really good, hopefully the service gets better."
12/30/2016,3,"Small portions on the Bento box, but the food was good. I ordered a spicy tuna, the fish was fresh but they were stingy with the spicy mustard. The restaurant was not busy but service was slow with the food and check."
4/15/2016,4,"This year for our regional confrence we had small lunch groups. This was designed to give us a better chance to connect with our co-workers we only see a few times a year. Of course we threw the rules out the window and 2 of the groups ended up here - which actually accounted for more than half of the team haha --- so what was to be a small lunch turned into a family affair.I went with:Florida Roll - tuna, salmon, cream cheese, avocado, scallions, masagoMexican Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, topped with shrimp, eel sauce, spicy mayoBoth rolls were super solid - and the pieces that I snagged from my table-mates were also really good.The atmosphere here is very different from a ""traditional Japanese/sushi restaurant"". It's modern, large, loud....it's basically fast casual sushi - which is fine, especially for the area they are in. I do want to mention that they had super nice staff. From the girl that took our order, to the young lady cleaning the soda machines, everyone was super nice."
11/1/2019,5,Yummy yummy in my tummy. Bento make me wanna eat everything and look like a gummy. Don't be a dummy and eat crummy. Come to bento and let's get chummy.
11/17/2019,1,This place has gone from a 10 for my family and I to a 1! Happy hour is horrible now. It's now self service at the same price!! They no longer have white wine for my wife. All they have is Moscotto and Pinot Noir (which the cashier called Peanut newer lol). My family enjoys going out to dinner and paying our hard earned money so we can relax and enjoy a meal together.  I have now spent more time in the line to order than actually sitting with my family!  I am done with this place.  It's a shame
6/16/2020,1,"I ordered a side of mixed veggies (among other things) through Uber eats. They tasted like chemicals and there was no seasoning. I rinsed them with water and they tasted okay, but how gross. Why are you sending out unwashed vegetables without any seasoning?"
3/24/2019,5,High Quality Food with Great Service. We love the Bento Chain and this location was no exception. No wait on a late Saturday afternoon and the food came out perfect! It was a great addition to our farmer's market walk. 10/10 would go again.  Our only comment would be that this location did not have boba tea which we missed but there was a boba shop right next door.
4/27/2018,4,2018 Review 35/100Have a taste for sushi? You can't go wrong with Bento. They may not have the best sushi in town but it's always fresh and fast and the service is good. I'm particularly fond of their build-your-own Poke bowls. So many great options for building the perfect bowl. A great option for happy hour (2-4-1 wine) to grab a quick bite before catching a movie at the theater next door.
1/28/2021,2,"To-Go order: My visit tonight was very unpleasant. My order was placed online and was supposed to be ready at 8:08pm. Upon entering, I let them know I was picking up an order. The staff member checked and told me that they didn't have that order and asked if it was under another name. She checked and came back a few minutes later and asked if I was at the correct location. I assured her that I was showing her my order verification and after verifying the address she proceeded to go to the back and I then said my order number. I WAS NEVER ASKED FOR MY ORDER NUMBER and I'm not sure what question would have came next if I didn't mention it. She then stated that there was a mix up in the order and it only came to the ""tablet."" I was not sure what that meant but she stated that the kitchen staff would make it as quick as they can. I waited until 8:29 and I asked the staff member at the counter for an update on my order. This was not a great experience, and nothing was offered, nobody gave updates on my order, no apology. Just nothing...I got my food at 8:31 and walked out of the establishment. Only to find a parking ticket on my car for being in a parking spot for longer than 15 minutes. What an evening....."
5/31/2018,5,"Bento Cafe is a great spot downtown to get a balanced, filling meal that tastes amazing! Have you ever had a bento box? You pick a protein and sauce, brown or white rice, and lo mein noodles, with a salad and green beans. It's so delicious and only costs around $10. If you check in on Yelp you also get a free Appetizer with your purchase!"
2/12/2016,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place. That was probably obvious as soon as you saw the three stars at the beginning of my review. Bento has some yays and nays.Let's start with the yays. The location is superb. They're located right under the Cobb movie theater downtown, and it's convenient place to grab a bite to eat before or after a movie. You can literally just walk upstairs to the movie theater instead of timing your meal so you have time to walk from wherever else you happen to be eating. Another yay: the decor is nice. It has a modern feel to it but doesn't feel hipsterish or pretentious. In other words, as a man without a beard and/or man-bun, I feel comfortable here.The food is where we start to get into mixed territory between yay and nay. I'll call this area schmay. The food is good but not great. They give you decent sized portions and there is a wide variety of food to choose from between sushi platters and stir fry bowls. The variety is nice, but the food itself is just ok. It's good if you're just filling up before a movie, but it's not a place I'd recommend if you're looking for some really good Asian fusion food in Orlando. It's not gross, it gets the job done, the prices are fair, but nothing really elevates it to, ""HOLY CRAP YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE"". Now is the part for the nays. I've eaten here about four or five times now, and each time, it has taken a long time to get seated. Not because they're overcrowded but because it takes forever for someone to notice that I've been standing at the, ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign for over five minutes. I hate nitpick on something like this because I like to think I'm a patient person, but I don't think having an employee manning the host position is too much to ask for instead of waiting for a random waiter to notice that me standing there. Once seated, the service becomes better. Tonight, our waitress was very attentive and the food came out fairly quickly. In previous visits, it took what seemed like an eternity for the food to come out. I shouldn't complain about that because good food takes time, but what you get doesn't really justify the wait. Pro-tip: If you're eating here before a movie, ask for the check along with your meal. That way, you can get that out of the way as soon as possible so when you're done eating, you can get to your movie on time instead of waiting around for your bill and your receipt. They're usually pretty good about that as long as you let them know ahead of time that you're on a schedule. If Bento can step up their game when it comes to customer service and unique, quality dishes, I'd totally be willing to cheerlead for this place to become an Orlando ""must-go"" spot. As of now, it's just a good filling station before I see a movie downtown. It's definitely not bad, but it's not great."
1/11/2019,5,"The bento in sand lake gives local discounts to universal employees! It's only ten percent but seriously, it's such a nice thing they do. I love restaurants that help support other local workers. Also their sushi is amazing. I've also had their red curry with tofu and that's the bomb. Their crab Rangoon's are great and so are their spring rolls. Miso soup is awesome too. Everything on their menu is great."
2/12/2016,3,"Three stars for food that's not bad (and often times a solid B+) and convenient for a bite before a movie. And my update with a higher rating is because they reached out and invited me back to try it again, which is pretty awesome customer service. While the visit was definitely better, the food was still just ""good"", without being all that great. That being said, with the convenience and reasonable prices, I'll still come back if I'm hungry before a movie and have already parked in the building's lot.Pro tip: if you're dining before a movie and you see the restaurant crowded, ask for your check with your food because getting the check can sometimes take a bit long when there's a rush. And the portions are large so if, like me, you always have leftovers- ask for a box along with your food, too. (and then be a jerk and send your husband to go put it in the car while you stroll up to the movie theater... not that I've done that...)"
1/6/2019,5,Just went today and ordered 2 sushi rolls and both tasted amazing!! Very satisfied and fresh!! Wish there was a happy hour on Sunday but I understand.
7/8/2016,4,"Enrique, is an amazing first time,only 1 year working, not trained server but with the passion and proactive reaction of a well seasoned amazing server. The food is consistently wonderful. It pleases all the senses."
11/5/2018,5,"Loved my food. Ordered the Zombie roll, a California roll and the garlic edemame. Everything was fresh and tasty. I would definitely visit again."
12/9/2019,5,"Bentos is a chain restaurant that originated in Gainesville. Consistent across all stores and they have a great variety of Japanese and Thai dishes. If you're undecided of what to eat and want a good variety, go here and get a bento box."
5/16/2020,5,Omg I freakin love to build my own Poke Bowl and it turns out so delicious  Their chicken  and steak  teriyaki are both so yummy! Also love the shrimp tempura with spicy mayo! Omg posting this review makes me want to go again tomorrow lol
7/14/2018,5,"Shawn provided excellent service - quick, attentive, knowledgeable & courteous! The food was also great, per usual. We'll definitely be back soon."
10/9/2017,5,"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service. Cole was my server last night and he was outstanding! I was there for quite a bit taking care of some paperwork since I just moved in to the building upstairs from this location. I'm super happy that it's right downstairs! The menu selection and prices are amazing so I look forward to being a regular here. I hadn't given his place much of a chance before since I'm not into sushi, but they have several options that are available vegetarian. Highly recommended. Try the crab rangoons too for sure!"
8/8/2018,5,"Staff is always friendly, they work very fast & the establishment is very clean! I love the sriracha garlic chicken :)"
8/30/2015,4,"4 Stars for a solid pre-movie meal in an ideal location!Bento is my go-to for a quick meal before a movie. The space is a bit cramped, but I actually like the way it makes it clear you're in the city. I know a bunch of reviews mention that the food can take some time, but if you talk to the server first they'll let you know that the sushi rolls may take a bit more time but the bento boxes are very quick to come out! I always order the bento box and am never disappointed. It is like a perfect little TV dinner but MUCH better than what you can get in the frozen aisle (get that meatloaf out of here!). The box comes with a side salad, green beans, your protein choice, rice, and a dessert. I've never finished it all so you're getting a great value for your money too!First you pick the flavor, then the protein. I usually go with the wonderfully savory Mongolian sauce with chicken or the Yellow Curry sauce with tofu. Both are great choices (particularly if you don't care for much spice). Just to reiterate- if you're catching a movie within the hour, make sure to let your server know. If you only have half an hour, you should probably just grab a bite in the theater. I don't think it's reasonable to expect to be seated, order, get food, eat, and pay in less time.Can't wait for my next date night!"
10/24/2018,2,"When I called for delivery they left me on hold for 25 minutes and never answered. While we waited for them to get back to us on the phone I ended up using my husbands phone to place an online order. We could not order nigiri or sake through the online service. We placed an order anyway because my husband really wanted a specific dish. When the food finally arrived 2 hours after being placed, they missed 2 dishes. Not only did they keep changing the deliver times but they forgot the Volcano roll AND the sauce for the Katsu dish, which is the one dish my husband wanted. For these reasons I give this place 2 stars."
11/8/2015,5,I love Bento! I've been there several times and always order the Sushi Bento Box (which comes with their delicious seaweed salad). My favorite rolls are the special Mexican and the Mount Fuji! I definitely recommend them! Their spring rolls with the sweet Thai chili sauce is a great starter (which you can get for free if you check in!!) It's one of the few good sushi places downtown. I will definitely be back! :)
6/6/2019,2,"Really disappointed with my most recent Bento visit. I used to love it here and was excited to go back, unfortunately I will not be going back again. Usually it's packed, this time it was empty. You have to order before sitting down and have to pay when you order, this makes sense in an area that's busy and looking for take out but not when you want to sit, drink and enjoy yourself. They also ask for tip... like who am I tipping and how do I have any idea how the service is going to be. If I wanted more then 1 drink I would have to either buy them all at once or go up each time to purchase another one. On top of the new ordering they were out of all the good saki(it was midweek too). Food was eh, came out quickly yes but the noodles were over cooked and soggy. The whole experience was disappointing, not sure how they are going to stay in business in this particular location the way it's going now."
4/24/2016,4,"I use to be somewhat of a regular here, but I haven't been in over a year or so. Even so I've had good experiences here. My friend's and I decided to come here right before the Orlando Pride game. I usually do not venture from their sushi rolls (good fusion sushi), but decided to this time. I was pleasantly surprised with my order of the Spicy Tuna Salad. It was a bed of field greens with cucumber, avocado (delicious on everything), seaweed salad, tuna (with spicy mayo over it), and a ginger dressing on the side ($9). Two of my friends had sushi, which they enjoyed. And the other had a Thai fried rice bowl with chicken... he liked it, but I don't think he was in love with it.The service was good. The food came out in reasonable time. All in all, a good experience once again!"
8/6/2015,4,"My wife and I were in downtown Orlando late one evening and have not had any dinner.  I had heard about Bento and decided to give it a try.  A good sign was that the place was absolutely packed.My wife will not eat sushi, but I am all in.  She checked out the menu before we asked to be seated, and was pleasantly surprised that they do offer other selections besides sushi. I had one of their bento boxes of sushi for $9.95.  Great value if you don't know your way around the different types of sushi rolls.  Mine came with the California roll, the Tampa roll, and some sort of a spicy Mexican roll.  It was absolutely delicious.I remember tasting my wife's dish, two was very good.  This is definitely one of those places that I will return to.  When you check in on Yelp!, they have a free appetizer offer with a $10 purchase.Definitely worth a try, if you're not familiar with sushi, be adventurous and give it a whirl.  You will not regret it."
9/2/2017,5,"I'm hooked on Bento Cafe!!! I have walked by this place hundreds of times and it wasn't until recently I decided to give it a shot. I have eaten here 3 days in a row and I'm in no way complaining. This is a great place for a quick, affordable meal. I have tried multiple items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite is the ""build your own poke bowl"" they give you plenty of options and all of the ingredients are always fresh. The staff is always friendly and make sure to provide a laid back atmosphere."
9/2/2017,1,"Poor service from start to finish. We arrived to Bento around 7:00, it was moderately busy for a Friday night. There was a couple ahead of us, we all waited patiently to be greeted, took about 2 minutes for someone to acknowledge them & to be seated. There was zero acknowledgment of us by the host & we stood for another solid 2 minutes for our party of 4 to be greeted & sat.Our server was a young blonde boy, friendly enough. He took our order, we were unable to order just a plain side of fried rice, a protein had to accompany the rice. Odd. Not the end of the world, we adjusted the amount of sushi we ordered each to share the rice.The food took FOREVER to come out. In fact, an 8 top that sat at the same time received their food, ate it, paid & the table was being resat by the time our (incorrect) food arrived. Half the annoyance was the lack of communication, a manager should have been made aware of the delay & made a table visit. Though our food was delivered incorrect it was quickly corrected.The fried rice (with chicken) was decent, the Volcano Roll had a thick blob of crab paste over top rather than the light mayo based crab salad I was anticipating.Over all it was a disappointment, I will not return to Bento."
8/16/2017,5,"I've tried a ton of items on the menu at Bento in the past,  but this 5 star review goes out to my one true love, the Japanese Curry. Ever since I first tried it on that glorious day, I can't bring myself to order anything else on the menu anymore. No, seriously, it's THAT good.My favorite way to order it is with a curry katsu rice bowl. The curry is not spicy at all, but rather has a rich and savory flavor. I actually did some research, as Japanese curry is somewhat new to me, and I learned that it's a ginger base curry (sometimes called golden curry) which makes A TON of sense considering my obsession with all foods ginger.But enough about their Japanese curry.. everything else really is excellent as well and the service is always top notch. This downtown location gets slammed on the weekends, so it can feel a bit cramped in the small space, but it's never been a major issue for me."
5/30/2016,4,"Love Bento. Great food, from sushi rolls and noodle bowls. Something for everyone to enjoy. I love the Special Mexican Roll the most, as well as the krab wontons! always a great staff, who are friendly and helpful."
7/4/2015,4,"I was really impressed with this place! I got a tuna roll made with no rice  (I was feeling very healthy) and it was delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. The tuna was very fresh and enjoyable. The veggies were also very fresh and firm. I also got a ginger salad, but I wasn't that impressed. The dressing was just okay and I probably wouldn't get it again. My husband got the orange chicken bento box and it was a ton of food! He really liked it and didn't finish everything. The restaurant itself was very clean and nicely styled. It had tall ceilings and a modern vibe that worked well. Our server was pleasant and brought everything fairly promptly. The check took a bit longer than it should have, but we were part of a group so it wasn't unexpected.Overall, I really enjoyed this place. It was fresh, really conveniently located, and reasonably priced."
2/24/2019,1,The freshness of the sushi is lacking. Ok prices Not great sushi. Move on unless you want mediocre.
11/25/2015,5,So! Much! Food! Quality bento boxes and at a more than fair price . The seasonal pumpkin wontons were amazing :)
8/16/2015,2,"Decided to grab a bite here with my husband tonight before our movie upstairs, but I quickly regretted it. We didn't have a ton of time before the movie start time, but we were really hungry, so we figured we'd just go downstairs and maybe just be a little late to our movie. The movie was to start at 7:45pm, but everyone knows they always show a bunch of commercials and trailers, first. No big deal if we're 10, even 15 minutes late, especially since we already had our tickets in hand. We got there around 7:30pm. Ordered our food around 7:40pm, since my husband was feeling indecisive and we took advantage of the free appetizer with Yelp check in! Our appetizer of choice was fried pork dumplings and arrived at our table almost instantly. I was like, ""Cool, see, this was a good idea!"" - but I was wrong. We ordered our entrees at the same time we ordered our appetizer to try to expedite the whole process, and even though we ordered everything at approximately 7:40pm & got our appetizer super quick, we didn't receive our entrees until around 8:10pm! Yes, approximately half an hour later on a Sunday evening when they didn't even seem that busy and we had to watch everyone dining at the tables around us receive their food before us. No explanation was ever given, either. It was so frustrating, to say the least! We just ate as quickly as possible & left! I thought, good thing I was smart enough to ask for the check right after ordering, as well or else we would've been even later for our movie! I did later tell my husband, though, that I wish we hadn't paid right away, so we could just have left cash on the table for the app & left, instead of sitting across from each other, looking at each other with pure anxiety & frustration. Having a small child means we don't get many nights out just the two of us, so it's even more frustrating when our precious, rare alone time is wasted! This was our first time here and they definitely did not leave a good impression on us. I think we'd come back in the future (MAYBE) but ONLY if we had plenty of time to spare!"
9/3/2019,2,Bento's used to be my favorite place to go 4 Sushi and their Bento Box. However ever since they did away with table service the quality of food and service has become terrible. The sides in a Bento Box are nothing more than a forkful of lettuce and a fork full of noodles. And they have done away with they're sweet wonton dessert. The sushi and rolls remain fresh but have become smaller in size. It's very disappointing and I probably will not go there anymore
6/17/2017,4,"Returned and again did the Happy Hour buy two rolls and get another free... but ordered the  volcano roll (krab, cream cheese, avocado, topped with salmon, then baked with spicy mayo, topped with scallions) and also the Florida roll which includes tuna, salmon, cream cheese, avocado, topped with masago. That was perfect!"
11/22/2019,5,"This restaurant is very good for the price! For about $10-$15 you get a big bowl full of food, and a drink! Plus, you can even get a drink and side for a few dollars extra. The service was very quick as well. This is a great option if you like Asian food, and you're in a bit of a rush!"
11/2/2017,2,"A few of my contacts raved about this place, but I wasn't too impressed. It's your typical overdressed, forgettable, generic Asian-fusion chain restaurant.The place seems to get a little crazy on busy nights, with everyone running around like the kitchen is secretly on fire. The service was hot-and-cold; the servers either outright ignore you or homestead at your table. I tried a sushi combo one night, and a noodle bowl a couple days later. The food was just alright, nothing spectacular or offensive either way; maybe a little higher on price and presentation than it deserves. But I suspect most people don't go here to get fed, they go here because it's convenient to downtown and the theater. Like, if I had a choice I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but I wouldn't actively avoid it either. It's just...there. Location, location, location, as they say."
6/14/2018,4,I like bento. I think the quality has gone down over the years. I went in yesterday and wanted to get some sushi. It was okay but confusing. Do we order when we walk up or do we sit down? Always confusing. The food is good but the noodles are undercooked. The servers were nice but wouldn't really ask if we needed anything... especially since we ordered at the bar. Very confusing. Over all it is a place to come in and out. I would take the noodles home and cook them if you don't like it undercooked.
12/29/2015,5,"I'm proud to say that my first meal here in Florida was at this place and I wasn't disappointed. Although the exterior is dark, there's plenty of parking and the inside of the restaurant is lit beautifully. There's also outdoor seating if you don't want to wait for a table. For a table of 5 on a busy Sunday night, it was at least a 30 min wait so we opted to grab to go and a table outside. Food came out fast and the workers are very friendly. The beef fried rice was decent and flavorful. My father had the bulgolgi and he said it was awesome. Sushi was on point here! I would definitely recommend grabbing to-go here because it gets pretty busy."
8/5/2016,5,I frequent this place with co-workers at least three times a month. Matter of fact one one of them would come to work on a Sunday just for Bento's. The service is always great for takeout and dine in.I recommend the Spicy Cream Chicken. I typically get the noodle bowl but both the rice bowl and bento box are great choices depending on your taste and hunger level. I also love the spring rolls but truth be told I haven't had anything from here that I didn't like.
11/16/2019,5,"Always good.  It was raining slightly and we were walking back from a walk at Lake Eola.  My daughter wanted fried rice, it was a not a hard decision, take a short walk to Bento.  We got there and the line was long with a packed restaurant.  Their team was very efficient and friendly.  We ordered and sat within 10 minutes.  The steak wok fried rice and my Szechuan steak rice bowl came out quick and hot.  She devoured her bowl which meant it was really good.  My rice bowl was equally as good and the veggies we cooked just enough with still a crisp to them."
12/17/2017,2,"The bento boxes are decent.  Sushi is mediocre at best.   I usually go for lunch for the convenience factor, but tonight I went for dinner with friends, and now I don't think I'll go back.  The service was terrible.  It's always busy there, and tonight didn't seem out of the ordinary, but there was an insane delay between when we ordered and ultimately got our food.  Nearly 45 minutes for my sushi roll? And to make it worse, the server was kind of unapologetic about it.  It may not have been his fault, but he didn't even make an effort to check in, get drinks, etc.  I even heard him snap back at some other customers who were growing impatient.  Not impressed."
9/28/2015,5,"Very happy with this place! Order at the front then sit yourself down. So it's like a mix of a fast food place and restaurant. I got the orange chicken bento box and it was so much stuff! All on a sectioned off tray, it was the perfect amount of food! I finished everything and it was all perfect. Not so much to comment on the service end since it's basically self serve other than they bring the plate to your table, I don't mind that at all, just average people working there. Neither rude nor super friendly. Perfect for a lunch break from work or a get together with friends, it's right under the downtown movie theater. I would totally come here for good eats then head upstairs for a movie!"
8/23/2015,5,"Happy to have found a Bento Cafe so close to our place in Orlando!  I usually went to the locations in Gainesville and that's where I learned about Bento's, so after moving down to Orlando I was hoping they'd have locations here and they do! (Quite a few, too ^^)I got an order of steamed Edamame courtesy of Yelp, and they were delicious! They were lightly sweet and salty - a perfect beer snack in my opinion. For my entree I ordered the Chirashi bowl with chef's choice of sashimi and it was heavenly! The sushi rice was light and not overly sweet, the strips of sashimi I got tasted really fresh and had a lot of fatty content in them (yum!), and it had a nice garnish of cucumbers and seaweed salad. Everything tasted light and well-prepared.I will be coming back! Thanks!!"
9/18/2016,5,"Exceptional quality with a unique twist. The noodle bowls are delicious and filling, and the sushi is flavorful and bold.It's a favorite lunch destination during the week owing to the simple ordering process and quick service.  I'm a huge fan of the bento boxes, either with the noodle or the rice. The Mongolian beef is to die for. The service has been hit or miss on the weekends, when it switches from order and pay to full service dining. The decor, however, has never been a disappointment, with the relaxing and inviting aura, coupled with the spacious and open seating area.The open kitchen concept is a nice touch, and the sushi chefs are either flown in from Japan or Japanese descendants, which adds to the quality of the sushi and the technique they employ. For quicker service they do provide takeout for those busy bees that need to eat or he run or at their office desk.My recommendation would be the order a miso soup, a small roll, likely the Florida roll, and finish off with a bentonite box. You'll leave satiated and ready to take a desk nap."
11/17/2015,4,"I probably eat here on average twice a week. The food at the price can't be beat. Good quality and quick. I like to try a different dish overtime I go in and I can't really say I've ever found a dish I haven't finished. For newbies I recommend the spicy cream chicken or any one of their amazing sushi rolls, but my new favorite item on the menu is the Curry Katsu. It's just spicy enough for me and I mean who doesn't love fried breaded chicken? At $10-$11 the bento box really can't be beat. It fills you up and gives you a number of options and flavors for you to munch down on."
5/23/2017,4,Bento is one of my go-to places for lunch in Downtown Orlando during the week! It can get a bit busy in there but I am always able to find a seat and get my food quickly. They usually have two people working the registers during busier times to get through the lunch rush line. I always order a Bento Box but usually change up what I get in it. I feel as though I get a lot of food for the price I pay - usually around $10. I am never disappointed in the food that arrives at the table (usually in a timely manner). Their sushi is also quite delicious. All of their food tastes fresh and flavorful.
11/6/2018,3,"Sometimes good. Sometimes bad. Good for quick bite. Orange tofu noodle bowl is better than shrimp. My friend had the tuna poke bowl which was ""underwhelming"". Last time staff did Not know what many items on the menu were! and food was sloppy and rushed. However, the first time we amazing service, BOGO wine, and tasted special."
10/17/2015,5,This has been one of my go to spots for a while! The location is perfect to stop before or after a movie in the plaza and even before a night downtown. The prices are reasonable and the bento box is the best deal! I can't help but always get the spicy cream chicken with salad noodles and a dessert. The cream sauce is a perfect balance of sweet spice! I wish I could bottle it! I've also tried the sushi and gone for their wine special night. Always great service and delicious food!
2/12/2018,5,"Went to Bento with a old co- worker to catch up. We ordered special Mexican, Hot lava, and the TNT sushi. It was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this location over the sand lake because it seems to cater  more to the locals."
6/18/2019,5,"Everything from here was delicious especially the bowl where you add your own ingredients, the best tofu ever!"
11/20/2019,4,"I eat here for lunch 1-2/mo, I work downtown.  I get the same thing every time because I like it. (Bento box - mostly because of the box so mu food doesn't touch) I love the green beans and the edamame.  Today, I ordered the same thing as always and the cashier rang it up, whatever.   They brought me broccoli, no beans.  Where are my beans, I asked? The young man was very polite.  He apologized once,  explained (farmers-whatever) offered me anything to substitute.  I only like what I like and I told him that there was nothing else I wanted or that he could do,  just bring entree and rice (yuck) so he brings WAY too much rice in a HUGE bowl with the ckn on top of it.  My friend smiled and looked down because she knew I couldn't/wouldn't eat it.  I smiled and explained that it was touching so he immediately swept it away and brought me 2 separate bowls 1with rice 1 with ckn.  Both times with a smile.  When it was finally as good as it was going to get,  I explained to him that I was not trying to be a dick and that I appreciated his respectful attitude and professional handling since I recognized the situation was beyond his control.  Lesson:  sometimes crappy things happen but it's how you handle it that makes you rise above the common.  Great job handling this unfortunate situation.  Lunch was so-so today but I got great service and felt good about the encounter."
6/9/2015,1,If they had a negative star to choose from I would select that!! You come downtown all amped with high expectation and end up with plastic wear. Even plastic cups and plates. And this after being told I could not have a more comfortable table because they had cleaned it for the night and the server for that section had left for the night..... REALLY?! Shrimp Tempura was under cooked while the Krab in the spider roll was way over cook. Very greasy. My friend and I took one bight and was ready to leave. We tried to stick it out even though we did not like the feel nore the service.... We wanted to give this place a chance. Now we can't figure out how they stay a float.??!!
2/11/2017,5,Five stars for the Spciy Don with half tuna half salmon! Always taste fresh and love the cucumber salad with avocado on it! The rice alone is perfection... I swear they put crack on their rice! Pure sticky perfection!! I can't speak for the sushi here but I can't stop coming back for the spicy don bowl! Healthy(ish) and delicious!
4/1/2017,4,"While staying at a near by resort, my friends and I were craving sushi and when we went on Yelp, this was the closest location that was still open at 9pm on a Saturday Night.  After we had ordered  4 rolls, crab Rangoon, and tonkatsu with red curry.  Everything came out to be under $20 and we were super stuffed.  I was hoping we would have restaurants like this in NOVA, but sadly, this chain is only located in Florida. I will definitely be coming back for more!"
2/15/2011,4,"Yum. Not sure why it took me so long to try this place out. Great location, in the Downtown Plaza. The ambiance is pretty cool, very open and low lit along with some cool textures among the light fixtures.  It was poppin' on a Saturday evening but we were seated very quickly and it looks like the turnover was pretty quick for a small, busy place. We sat next to the window so we did have to deal with the people walking by looking in the window. It wasn't bad though and any seat on the perimeter will be this way as it's all windows. Cheese wontons? YES PLEASE! They are like Crab rangoon but with more amazing cheesy goodness than usual. They came out hot and fresh along with some great edemame that was cooked perfectly. It took a while to get my glass of wine but the Riesling was refreshing. I went with the Gucci roll and let me tell you, delicious. It was like a low key volcano roll with crab and steamed shrimp. The topping was a tad spicy for me but delicious. It had ten pieces so with the two apps it was perfect.I dig this place and can't wait to go back and try lunch!"
5/30/2017,3,"First try of bento's today and it was decent. For starters the customer service sucked we went on a Sunday around 4:00 and the place was not busy we walked in took a few minutes for anyone to greet us even though 3 men were working right at the Sushi bar. Finally an employee helped and told us to order up front and we could sit anywhere. I ordered the orange chicken bento box, my husband had the sweet and sour shrimp. My bento box was ok but the chicken had a off taste not sure why (maybe not completely fresh). The noodles were cold and there was no one available to let you know it was cold once they brought you your box they disappeared into the back. Sting beans luke warm, I enjoy the ginger salad and the rice the most. My husband did not like his shrimp but ate everything else. I may try again maybe after 5 that's when they stated they do table service."
9/27/2017,4,Bento's food is delicious which is why I return so often but sometimes I feel like their staff makes a better effort on presentation some days more than others. Today's meal tasted great but it looked like it was sloppily put together.
3/8/2019,4,Great sushi. Quick bento box. Good portion sizes. Friendly service. Got free appetizer thru yelp....crab wontons!
5/4/2017,2,"Every time I come here I love it. Calling ahead for takeaway is SO EASY! I've never had to wait more than 5-10mins, until today. I'm late to work & the validation left me paying $5 for something that should've been free since I waited so long on my order that was sitting on the shelf! Mind you I called approx 10 mins prior to my arrival. 30 mins later I was out the door. I was the only person waiting for their food! I could understand getting overlooked if it was busy in the front... All that was needed was for someone to check back in earlier than 20 mins. I won't be back here for a while- it left me with a bad taste in my mouth for lunch before work."
5/22/2017,4,"This was my First time at the downtown location. I got there right as they opened and was the first person there. The employees were super nice and helpful with my questions as I noticed that the menu is a bit different and smaller than the UCF location. I usually get the create a don but I opted for the poke bowl and half a roll of a jean role which Were very good. The bowl was more than enough as I felt like I could have been rolled out of there but hey no regrets. You only live once right? The poke bowl was fresh, had some tuna in a soy sauce, avocado, a nice portion of Wakame, onions a couple mango pieces, some edamame beans and lots of rice. It was very pretty to look at and the price was just in line with the portion. I was a bit disappointed by the smaller menu since I'm used to the UCF one but on a positive note less options? Also I think I got 3 or 4 tiny piece of mango, so I felt like I was yipped on that and It really gives the bowl that sweet and salty balance."
9/24/2019,4,"This was a great place to grab a quick bite. They have a great build your own mentality with bento, curry, udon, and pretty much any other of your favorite Asian dishes. Food came very quickly which was great when I was so hungry."
8/27/2018,4,Good place for lunch time. It was super crowded around noon. The food took awhile to show up so that's why 4 stars. Food was great and plenty to eat. Looking at how they make sushi rolls are entertaining as well. Come stop by for a lunch?!
7/1/2015,5,"Best sushi restaurant. The quality of the rolls is always amazing. The flavors really pop, fish tastes fresh and I always leave full. I got the Crunch roll, Special Mexican roll, TNT roll and the Volcano rollCrunch roll comes slightly warm because the outside is flash fried to get the texture. Inside it's creamy from the cream cheese and tuna. It's a sweet roll from the eel sauceTNT is predominately tuna. special Mexican gets all different flavors. Goes down smoothly with a mix of spice and sweet. volcano has the salmon flavor. All delicious. Free appetizer with checkin."
5/9/2017,4,Came In Here after the movie. Needed food after popcorn....ya know.  I ordered rainbow roll and boy Bulgogi. Then I checked in after I sat down and noticed they had a free appitizer when spending $10 or more. So I went back up to counter and they gave me another number for my salad with miso dressing. Soooo all in all it was great. The items were both pretty good! Boy I'm full now tho!!
4/30/2013,4,"My second time going to a Bento Café in Orlando. My first experience was horrible. But this time around... it was the total opposite!The restaurant itself is very open and it had neat décor hanging from the ceiling. Our server was a younger guy- who was absolutely amazing. He seemed like he enjoyed his job, and was very attentive to us at the table. He was always sincerely smiling also!I had the soy chili beef bento box, which was great! Perfect amount of spiciness and perfect amount of food.... Overall delicious and fillingGreat experience at Bento's. Will go again!"
10/4/2019,4,It's a nice place to eat especially if you were thinking of going out after. The best Chicken tempura I've had so far. Try it.
12/15/2018,4,"This Bento box is amazing. The colors are vibrant, and the food tastes great. The amazing thing about this place is that they serve your food quickly."
8/5/2017,5,"Love this place. Great location downtown at the Cobb theatres on Orange Ave. Great selection of Bento Box, Noodle bowls, Rice bowls, Sushi, and many other options. Decent prices and all around good place."
11/7/2016,5,This is the place where I learned to love sushi!  I was never much of a seafood eater and the thought of seaweed and raw fish really grossed me out. Bento changed all of that! Their Lust roll has fried tilapia on top so it has a bit of crunch and a LOT of flavor so it wasn't an intimidating sushi taste. After that I have tried at least 20 of their other rolls and have never been disappointed. They also have rice and noodle bowls with chicken and other meat that are delicious as well. We have birthday parties and get togethers with friends here quite often so even if you aren't a sushi lover (I recommend at least trying the Lust roll) you can still enjoy an awesome meal! The location is awesome as well in the heart of downtown right under the movie theater at the Plaza. The parking garage is a little tight but they will validate for a certain time slot for you to park during dinner. And the theater validates as well if you decide to do dinner and a movie. I recommend Bento for lunch or dinner!
3/30/2019,5,"Always greeted with a smile, I've been here numerous times and the staff is always upbeat and seems happy to serve you! I usually order the Kawaii roll or chicken curry katsu bento box, superb every time! Food is always quick to!"
8/10/2018,1,Thanks bentos for taking it upon yourself to cancel my Uber Eats order and not having the courtesy to call or notify me or anyone at Uber eats. Mediocre customer service.
9/7/2017,5,"Suzuki was great. We came for their happy hour, which it awesome. We did the 2 for one Sakai and also two rolls getting a classic free. Had the Kawaii rolls and I absolutely loved it. The other rolls were great also. I've never been let down here!"
9/6/2017,3,Average.I ordered the red curry for lunch carryout. The sauce had very little flavor and was quite thick.  There was barely enough sauce to cover the vegetables.  Also it was all smashed into a small to-go container and it just did not look appetizing.I ordered in the restaurant around 1pm on a Wednesday and waited and waited and waited. I was about to ask why it was taking so long when it was brought out.I will not be returning.
12/2/2018,1,Waited around ten minutes for service no one came went to the front to ask for my waitress. I ask for napkins they told me to do to the back that I'll find everything I need.... Where's the service if u can provide de básicamente service
7/5/2018,5,"I like the fact that at this location you are able to go up to the register, order and then pick a seat.  I like this concept because it tends to move pretty fast.  There are plenty of seats available!  Super clean place, you are able to grab as many chopsticks, napkins or utensils right at the fountain drink station; which I love b/c you don't have to keep asking the server for this.  My food has always come out as great as the other Bento location.  You can also place order ahead and pick up, I have never had an issue here, staff is always friendly."
10/26/2017,5,This place is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite. The price is average. The foods are great. I love Dragon roll. I will definitely recommend this restaurant
12/5/2018,3,"So the local bento is a solid option if you're looking for something quick, hot, and flavorful. It's convenient and tasty and at least today was pretty quick. The two things I don't like so much are, you're pretty limited as far as your stir fry/bowl options. If you're like me and trying not to eat rice or noodles, there's no veggie base option. You just basically have to pay an up charge and create it yourself. This kinda irks me because I'm getting extra vegetables but I'm saving you the base you would have given me so in my mind, it should be a fair trade ‍ either way, I'm hoping they expand their base options in the future for those that don't want to get a rice bowl only to throw away all the rice. Second thing, I ordered the Sriracha garlic with Shrimp. Super tasty, definitely no complaints there, and served steaming hot. But as you can see in the pics, it's like.... 70% breading and 30% shrimp. It was described as Wok fried which in my mind sounded like something lightly fried so I was a bit disappointed when it came out as more breading than actual shrimp."
6/23/2020,5,"When I'm craving Asian food, my go to is Bento. For sushi I've had the cali and special mex roll. The Special Mex is so delicious. If you like sushi and shrimp, it a must try. On Tuesday's the chicken teriyaki bowl is $6 and it's good. The wok bowl is really good, as well as the lomein. Their sauces are a must, try them all! The only items I've tried that I wasn't a fan of was the ginger salad and cold noodles."
6/14/2014,5,Yummy sushi! On Saturday they do all you can eat sushi from 12-5. Good deal. You get a fountain drink and soup or salad. They have rules about how many rolls you can order at a time and you can't order again until you finish your rolls. they wanted to prevent excess leftovers and the waitresses were very sweet and attentive when they saw we were almost finished and ready to order the next round.The location is right by the movie theater which makes it a great place to grab a meal before or after catching a flick. I first had bento in Gainesville and continued to go to the one in Orlando. They customize their sushi to your liking and have quick service. Definitely coming back!
6/20/2019,5,Amazing food and great service i will be returning soon everything was hot and freash all my questions were answered not a long wait over all super happy with my experience
11/17/2017,4,I visited during lunch time around 12:30pm and it was a bit packed. Although i had to wait for only 10 minutes to place my order. I decided to get the Bento Chicken Rice bowl and my god the food was good and quantity was huge. I also got chicken dumplings which were tasty. The ambiance was great and am glad my colleague introduced this place to me :)
6/14/2016,5,"This is my absolutely favorite sushi place in downtown. I always order a new sushi roll and they've always been on point  I love their happy hour, buy two sushi rolls and get the third for free. It can add up, but it is sushi and it's really good!! I like the atmosphere too, very clean, organized, friendly service. It's literally in the middle of downtown, underneath the movie theaters. I definitely recommend this place :)"
11/3/2017,5,I love this place i come all the way from kissimmee to eat here. Always on point fast and the manager is very nice and fast.
8/25/2016,3,"**Attention** ManagersI have been at Bento's ones but it is was fast only was there with a friend and we where in out lunch and I had a great time here. I love their food it was delicious. So I had to go again but with more time and have a nice dinner with my husband.So I did around 3 weeks after this day.But I regret it omg it was the worst experience ever on my life.The first time I dined here I was with my friend and she helped me order since I don't speak English well. Right now I'm using a translator to right this review and I believe it would have many mistakes but oh well I'm doing the best I can. So when I ask the waitress if she speaks Spanish she told me ( I'm sorry I don't) and told me that their manager dose speak Spanish and that she would go and have her help us. This waitress it was really nice bout it. So I was facing the way she walked away and I saw when she when and talk to her manager and all I see is this ""manager"" if you call a person like that a manager, making horrible faces and attitude to the waitress and and ugly faces like she got really mad and you could tell that she was telling the waitress not to do this that she was to busy. So the waitress came back and say, my manager is doing something right now but if you don't mind I can try to help you and we can try to make this work. I told her that I know a little English but that we are not good at all since we only been living here for 1 year and that I would need help to understand the menu and ask about the condiments on the food so that I prefer to wait till the manager could had the time to wait. So she says ok no problem can I get you guys something to drink and we did got out drinks. Wait 10 minutes and still waiting there and all she was doing it was on her tablet. Keep waiting 15 more minutes and the waitress talk to her I think about us because she look back at us and after that she started to do the same thing, she rolled her eyes and breadth deeply and start waking to our table with a nasty face. I was so afraid omg that I was nervous while she was walking to our table I was thinking omg she is going to say something bad to us. So she games and say on Spanish ( can I have your order?) and I said I'm sorry we are not ready to order because I don't really understand the menu and that was my first time there and explain that I have been there only one time with a friend and that she helped me out so that I was lost any ways. She said everything is on the menu is not complicated you just need to read it. I would be back whenever you guys are ready and I stop her and say excuse me all I want to know is how some plates are made or what condiments it has. She told me I'm sorry but I can't sit here all day explaining the menu i have things to do plus I don't really speak Spanish. So then I ask ok so eat would you think we can eat that is going to be simple so we don't waste your time and she said to have this rice bowl that I don't even remember the name I'm sorry about that. So yes and then while my husband is telling her to bring him the same she took out order and tell us: you know we are in USA and you would need to learn English there is not going to be a Spanish translator to serve your everywhere. And I just open my eyes so big I was just impressed.She said that we Hispanic ppl need to learn that And I told her to excuse me but I know i need to learn English but I also know that we are in Orlando and that we have a lots of tourist here that just come to visit and that they don't need to learn just to be here 4 to 7 days so that I knew this is USA but I also know that here is lots of tourist so that me don't knowing English it was not a big deal. And she says oh yes it is really important because right now I'm taking out of my busy time to help you guys when y'all should know English already.And I was just in shock omg She left And never came back she was just there at the bar with her tablet. So the waitress girl  brought us out food we eat and when we where done and the waitress came to pick up out plates I ask her what was that ""managers"" name And she told me that her name was ANDRE And I think that the waitress told her that I ask about her name because she look back at us and roll her eyes and I was seen how she was moving her hands with a attitude I feel bad for that waitress maybe she got in trouble for saying her name to us. But any ways Ppl especially Latinos Don't come and eat at this place unless you speak English And Attention to the superior management ppl Please make sure you don't have hypocrites ppl working in places with customers if they don't like pplAnd I say hypocrite because I'm pretty sure that she is the type of persons that act proper and lovely in front of other bigger managers or owner. But I got so upset and I felt so discriminate that all I felt that day was sadness."
9/25/2016,3,"Thoroughly enjoyed our bento boxes.  This is somewhere between fast food and an slick urban restaraunt.  The food is like really good, really healthy fast food.  The green beans are a lovely touch.  I like this place.  Noisy?  yes--but with good energy.  I got the curry which was good.  Rob got bulgogi beef which was also good.  You know, for fastish food."
3/10/2015,3,"I had heard a lot about Bento with mixed reviews. I had came here for lunch with my boyfriend and we both agreed that the bento box (chicken teriyaki) reminded us of the mall food court and not the good kind. We absolutely loved the sushi and was blown away by that. For lunch, you order at the front, pay, and get your own drink then sit down as oppose to dinner where it is full service."
6/22/2016,4,A reliable go-to for lunch in the city.  We love the salmon don bowl - it's like a deconstructed sushi roll in the form of a chipotle-like bowl. It's delicious!!!!
3/25/2016,4,"I stopped by Bento Cafe when I was in Orlando and had a hankering for sushi. It was really good value, and Gabriel was a super friendly server. Only reason they don't get 5* was just that it was in a mini mall and just didn't have a very great ambiance to it. That said, we did sit next to a group of girls who were HIGHLY entertaining, So I guess, it's great for people watching. :)"
5/4/2019,5,Great place for sushi. The food is delicious. The service is very fast. The prices are great. We come here every other Friday for a sushi lunch.
11/9/2016,3,Wanted to grab something to eat before going to the movies. So we decided this place would work. our waitress was so nice and patient with us since we didn't known what we wanted when looking at the menu. once we decided the food came out fast. I am a big fan of bulgogi because my bestie korean mom use to make it for me all the time so if I see it on the menu i order it. It was ok. good enough to keep me fed and ready for the movie.
5/28/2020,5,"Bento has easily become my favorite place to dine at in Central Florida. The food, the atmosphere, the staff, and the social media team are my complete favorite! Each time I go in, whether it is at their Dr. Phillips or Margaritaville locations, the food is top notch. I usually go for the Pao Pao Chicken Rice Bowl and a Taro Boba Tea. The chicken is cooked perfectly and goes well with their white sauce. In addition, the boba tea tastes like an oreo cookie! I definitely will continue to frequent Bento."
3/11/2019,5,"I have always hated egg/spring rolls BUT HOLY GOD this is the most delectable thing I may have ever had. I think about the often they are so perfectly cooked here. And of course the sauce they come with is soo tasty. Their rolls are very filling and fantastic. I am obsessed with sushi and I highly recommend Bento. Also their tofu vegetable medley bowl is. Take out is fantastic too! We order for delivery (Uber eats, doordash, etc.) on fight nights and the food is always hot and perfectly cooked. I really highly recommend."
12/29/2016,3,"Stopped here after an event last night. It was packed, and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, the service was equally bad.You order from a counter, but for how swamped they were, they had one girl working the counter and she was over-whelmed. After a solid wait, we placed our order. Immediately after swiping our card, she simply left. No idea where she went, but we grabbed our receipt and went to a table.Not long after, a server brought out a bag. All of our food had been packed to go. Wtf? So we tell him the order was for here, not to-go, and he simply shugs and says, ""the order said to-go."" Okay... so please fix it?He notes we're welcome to open the bags and eat here, but never offers to y'know, take the food and fix it. Additionally, one item was missing.So we unpacked everything and ate. Once we got all our items, the food was delicious. I had the Katsu Curry, and we also had a Vegetable Stir Fry and Garlic Soy bento box. All delicious.Unfortunately, the server gave an incredible, ""it's the end of the night, we screwed up, eh, who cares"" vibe. Which sadly soured most of the experience.Ignoring the servers seemingly half out the door attitude, the food was excellent. Not sure we'd be back."
8/24/2016,4,We stopped here for a late night dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark with a lot of tables cramped together however we opted for the small sushi bar and were happy there. We had the sashimi special which was a plentiful array of sushi and sashimi completed with a spicy tuna roll...everything was very fresh. They have unique healthy sushi rolls which are wrapped with lettuce and rice paper...highly recommend the Surf 'n' Kawaii. We shared a bowl of shrimp tempura udon...the noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was rich...it reminded us of Marukame Udon.Overall we really enjoyed it and will likely be back
12/29/2018,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE, food is amazing & price is even better!! the location is great & the inside is too good."
1/21/2016,5,"I frequent this sushi location downtown. It can be a little slow at lunch time, so either order takeout ahead of time or be prepared to be there about 45min-1 hour. They have a nice wine selection and a great sushi selection.The Special Mexican Roll and the Crunch Roll are some of my favorites! I always get the edamame too."
3/7/2019,3,"The spicy chicken udon noodle bowl is my FAVORITE hands down from this place, but other than that  I feel like there are better places for quality sushi. I've had their soup and I feel it is over priced for the lack of consistency in the soup. The poke bowls were good but every add on is an upcharge and it can get pricey."
8/12/2019,3,"Sher didn't warn me that their ginger salad dressing was equally as effective as pepper spray as it is delicious. Other than that, good food, great service. As long as you don't accidentally flick the salad dressing into your eye, the place is great. Will upgrade to 5 stars once Sher agreed to grab drinks with me."
1/26/2017,5,Tonight is hockey with the Orlando Solar Bears at the Amway Center. But I am actually looking forward to my Spicy Tuna Don Bowl from the Bento kiosk at Amway. The food at this location is always so fresh and amazingly delicious. And the sauces they use are the best I have ever had. The staff that runs this location are truly dedicated to their culinary craft. I feel like a valued guest when I order my masterpieces from Bento. I can't wait until the doors open tonight!
2/2/2014,4,"I must pick up dinner from Bento once a week! It is a great downtown spot for typical Asian-fusion with decent prices and portions.  They offer a wide variety of Japanese and Thai style dishes that can be served as a bento box, noodle or rice bowl.  I love their pad thai (either chicken or shrimp) and their Thai fried rice has a nice kick to it.  The red curry dish is okay, the spice is very over powering and there is not much curry flavor to it.  I enjoy both their dumplings and shumai from the appetizer list.  They also have an extensive sushi menu, my favorite roll is the TNT roll which always has fresh tuna and a great kick!! I have always taken my food to go so I can't comment on the sit down service but they always have my food ready in 10-15 min from when I call it in and the staff at the counter is very friendly.  The decor inside is very modern with darker lighting and seems like it would be a nice date spot, especially before visiting the theatre upstairs. Be on the lookout for their new location in the UCF area on the corner of university and alafaya!!*tip: be sure and check their fb page as they have a number of specials including all you can eat sushi and half of bottles of wine and sake depending on the day!"
2/24/2016,3,"Food was decent but a little overpriced for the selection. Their sushi lunch combo is basically 1 roll plus 4 piece Californian for $10. No soup or salad, so not a great combo if you ask me. Great location if you work downtown and can walk but kind of a pain to park unless you are coming down here for an evening of fun. Service isn't too bad at lunch. Seating is cramped though."
12/8/2018,4,Winter Park location is not currently accepting coupons or check in discounts or offers.
8/1/2018,5,Wow! Super cheap for really good food! The menu is daunting and a little off to order from at first but the staff will help you out. Sushi is terrific. All the proteins are delicious. Don't skip the fried rice. Do a Tuesday movie upstairs ($5 all day) and definitely do this after.
2/17/2016,4,"I met up with some friends here yesterday and I wanted to try the new spicy miso ramen. It seemed a little pricey compared to another local ramen shop I've been to, and there weren't too many options with it (but then again, I didn't ask). The presentation was nice, even though I had asked for the pork on the side. The taste was okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either. Not really spicy. I would have liked more pork, or other veggies in the soup. Usually I come for their rice or noodles dishes. We dined in and it was a bit of a mess inside. A lot of tables were not bussed/not set. There were huge puddles of water near the soda machine and they had no water since there was a problem with their dispenser that was leaking. They gave us the option to choose from any of the other drinks, but my friends were a little irked. One of the servers boxed up my meal for me, and separated the broth from the noodles which was a plus! Tasted great the next day."
3/18/2018,3,This place really deserves a 3.5. The sushi is pretty good but the selection isn't. I had a hard time picking a few rolls that looked good during happy hour. I thought they had way too much imitation crab on the menu. I enjoyed the Mexican roll at least.
6/11/2016,4,"Our 1st time here.We've been to their UCF location many times and have always enjoyed it. This one caters more to the sushi eating crowd downtown.  Friendly help, good food, as always!"
9/13/2018,5,Love this place most affordable sushi with great quality. The bento box is very filling.
12/8/2015,2,"I didn't have the greatest experience at Bento Cafe.  Our server was very nice about the whole thing, but my food took over an hour to arrive, 20 minutes after everyone else at the table.  I ordered a seaweed salad that I never received, and while it wasn't included on my bill I wasn't given anything but an apology for the wait.Other than that, the sushi I ordered was not any of their fancy rolls, just a California Roll and some nigiri.  The tuna wasn't very flavorful, and the sushi wasn't anything extraordinary.  Overall not someplace I'd be dying to try again."
11/8/2018,5,"They were super slammed when we came for lunch today. The line took a while to get through but our food came out super fast and everything was fresh and delicious! The staff is constantly moving, making sure the tables are clean and that you have everything you need. Highly recommend!"
6/27/2016,5,I am very picky when it comes to my sushi. This is definitely one of my favorite places. Service is amazing! I order a sushi roll that was different from my usual roll. I only had one piece and realized I made a mistake. I told the waitress that I wasn't to find of it and she recommended a different roll in place of that one at no additional charge! That was super nice of her. Food was delicious. My friend ordered a soup and I had rolls. A very nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to others.
1/6/2014,4,I have only ordered noodle bowls here but I like them a lot. My favorite so far has been the Basil Beef noodle bowl. I have only ordered take out so I can't comment on the service. I wish I didn't have to wait so much in line to pick up and pay for my order but I guess they are just really busy and they get a lot of walk ins.
10/20/2018,4,Excellent mix of Asian styles. Had the crab cheese wontons (don't forget to check in on yelp so they are free) and Mongolian chicken bowl. There lowmain was cooked through and took the seasoning well and the bowl had a great mix of vegetables. The staff was supper friendly though initially they told us there was a 15 min wait they found us a table a few minutes later. Overall a great place to grab Asian fusion in downtown.
9/28/2015,3,"I've been to this location several times and each time I'm let down. The food itself is good. It's pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary. My issue is the staff here. I come during my lunch hour, and I get that it's busy. What I don't get is the attitude from the staff. I'm always very friendly because I understand how busy they get. The last thing they want is a troublesome customer so getting attitude when you're trying to be nice bothers me. I've always been greeted by unfriendly staff and I feel intimidated to ask questions..... The foods good but I won't go because of the service."
9/30/2018,5,"This is the best sushi spot in downtown Orlando. It's very quaint location and the salmon specialty signature bowl is right down seductive! There is no other sushi spot that offers such. So, visit and tell them you will thank me later."
12/5/2018,2,"After waiting nearly 30 minutes to receive my to go order today, I requested a couple white sauces. I am aware one is complimentary but the cashier said, no problem. Just ask when they bring your food. The waitress that brought my order told me she can only give me one. I needed to get back to work and decided not to argue about it. She then stared at me while I tried my back at the cashier area to make sure I don't try and ask one of the others for an extra sauce. I've been eating at Bento for 8 years. May be eating there a little less now."
8/25/2018,5,Spicy cream chicken is bomb!  used to order from this restaurant about two days a week!Highly suggested
4/15/2018,2,"Food was really great but friends food had a price of paper cooked in it, and server kept forgetting to bring things. Like our hot tea which he brought when we were ready to pay check cuz he had just remembered we ordered it before ordering our food."
12/23/2015,4,"I've only been here twice, but both times I really enjoyed it.  If you're a Yelper, make sure you check in!  You get a free appetizer!  I got the garlic edamame the first time and wasn't completely in love with it, so I went for the regular edamame the second time and very much enjoyed it.  I had a bento box with tofu stir fry on my first visit.  It was good and exciting that they offered tofu since I am a vegetarian.  On my next visit, I decided to go with the veggie delite roll and preferred that.  Both times I enjoyed some white peach saki!  It's so smooth and flavorful, it could get you into some trouble if you're not careful!  The staff is also very helpful and friendly, which is always refreshing when going out to eat.  Can't wait to go back!"
4/2/2015,2,"I was less than impressed with Bento Orlando, to be honest. The original Bento (blue) in Gainesville for a long time was a favorite of mine, but honest evaluation of it was clouded by fond memories of first dates there and the like. Plus, I believe in general the quality at all the Bento outlets I've visited has gone down over time. Maybe they have good days, but I feel their food is simply not of the caliber it was at the original location circa 2004-2009. Bento's downtown Orlando location has a great spot in an area thick with nightlife and, by day, a lot of office-workers. Thus, their business is probably pretty good. Unlike the Gainesville locations, they have waiter service at night instead of ordering at the counter. To me, this wastes time, money (for the additional tip) and staff resources. All other Bentos have, as far as I am aware, a policy of ordering at the counter then a waiter brings out the food. My waitress was perfectly nice and pretty attentive, but the approach just seemed unnecessary. The food was . . . sub-standard. The green beans, noodles, and salad in my bento box were all stale-tasting and seemed to have been sitting around too long. Granted, I was there late at night, but for three items included in all bento box orders to be off like this seems pretty poor. The garlic-soy chicken--the main item of my bento--was only ok, contained little chicken, and tasted also like it might have either sat around or (more likely) been prepared of ingredients that had marinated too long. If this only happened once, and less than an hour before closing, that would be ok. But it's been a common issue I've found at several Bento locations. Their food quality just seems to be slipping in dire terms. The interior is dark, trendy, and eye-catching. This could be a great restaurant if a little more care was placed in the quality coming out of the kitchen. Look to Hawker's for an example of what can be done with mid-point priced Asian-fusion cuisine in Orlando. Bento, I fear, is resting on its laurels and taking advantage of a plum location currently, nothing more."
8/6/2018,3,Sushi was ok nothing special (not worth the $40 we spent).   Weren't many options to choose from in my opinion.
3/27/2018,5,"Very busy, decent friendly service, validated $2.50 in Plaza pkg garage.  Food was most excellent!"
5/20/2016,5,I'm here all the time for lunch and dinner and tonight was especially nice. brought the family and had a serious feast. the Happy Hour is beyond ridiculous. ridiculously good now. 4-7. BOGO APPS SAKE AND ROLLS!! our server was the best. just look for the bearded guy. cheers!
11/22/2019,1,I ate here last night and got a salmon/tuna poke bowl. Everything was fine till I started throwing up hours later and couldn't stop. This place was the only thing I ate and I got food poisoning. DO NOT GET ANYTHING RAW UNLESS YOU WANT TO THROW UP FOR 7 HOURS STRAIGHT AND SLEEP ON YOUR BATHROOM FLOOR.
5/5/2018,5,"Had the Charashi Bowl when I went, Filled me up. It was great I went at happy hour and had 2 for 1."
12/30/2015,4,"I LOVE Bento! If it weren't for the parking situation, id be there every day. Some of my favorite sushi rolls include the Japanese Bagel, Tampa and Chicken Tempura rolls. If you wanna try an entree, go for the Spicy Cream Chicken. It's literally to die for. The service at this location is always great, and they have happy hour throughout the week. It doesn't get busy very quickly so be sure to get there early!"
11/22/2017,5,So yummy. I always make a point to stop in when I'm downtown. I haven't had anything bad here yet and the service is quick.
2/24/2018,3,"The servers and employees tend to take a while to acknowledge you when you walk in, leaving you with that awkward feeling of ""should we stay at this point?"" but once you're seated it's fine. They also take awhile to 'get the check to you, ring you out' when dining in. The food is as good as other locations so that's good, we generally order to go if when we can, but definitely a good pre or post movie theater meal."
9/18/2016,5,"We tried for the first time the buffet $22.22 menu which runs from 12-3:30pm as a summer special. We arrived at the restaurant at 3:05. They extended our summer special and accommodated our needs. The service was spectacular. The sushi is delicious. The hot tea was not very good. It did not seem typical of an Asian tea. We did not attempt to try any of the desserts because the sushi was delicious and very fulfilling. The decor was average. The lighting was great for the ambiance. Not to bright but not too dim. Perfect for lunch time. The temperature in the restaurant was great, very important in the Florida heat. The waitress was very nice. Always attentive and refilling our drinks appropriately. It was a great time here at Bento."
2/2/2016,3,"Sushi was good, the menu had a lot of variety. Quick and Easy, but nothing spectacular.Satisfying though !"
1/29/2015,2,"So, a while back my wife and I came here to get dinner before going to a movie. We didn't have a great experience. Slow service. Mediocre sushi. Lack of attention from the wait staff. But, we like to give places second chances. Sometimes people just have a bad day.So, last week we came back, hoping to catch dinner before going to see a movie. We got in aruond 6pm on a Thursday. The sign said for us to seat ourselves, so we did. Not busy at all. A few tables, that's it. Our server came by immediately and was really nice. Great start! But that's where things started to go downhill.Before I get into the negative. Let me just say our sever, I forget her name, was really really sweet. She was reasonably attentive. No real qualms with her. The problems seem to be rooted in the kitchen. My wife ordered a veggie delight roll, explaining that she can't have any dairy as she's allergic (NOT lactose intollerant..allergic. as in, dairy can kill her). I ordered one of the fancier rolls. My wife asked for a miso soup to start. That came out fairly promptly. The server came back about 5 minutes after we ordered to let us know that it was happy hour and we could get a classic roll for free since we ordered two rolls. Sweet. I ordered a plain salmon roll. All goodHowever, as time went on, we waited and waited for our rolls. 15 minutes. 20 minutes. Now pushing 30 minutes. Other diners came in, ordered and hard already started eating their meals, including sushi. So, it's not like sushi was the hold up here.Right when I was about to complain, the server brought out our plain salmon roll...the free one. OK, well, that's fine. At least we can eat something. Another 10 minutes goes by. Now we are getting close on time since we have a movie to catch. People who came in after us are finishing up and we really haven't even started the rolls we really ordered. Again, right when I was about to complain, she comes with our rolls and apologizes for the wait. Big problem however: my wife's roll has a huge chunk of cream cheese in each piece. Remember the dairy allergy? So, now we have to wait another 5+ minutes for them to remake it. Took them no time really, but I have to wait while my roll (which had tempura on it) is getting cold. I'm so hungry it hurts, and I just have to stare at my food because I'm not eating while my pregnant wife just sits there.Eventually we got our food and scarfed it down. Not enjoyable. The food was ok. nothing remarkable or worth the wait. I'll be hard-pressed to go here again. I feel bad for the server, as I know it's not her fault but she'll probably get the brunt of the comlpaints for the kitchen's ineptitude."
2/19/2009,5,"At the Bento restaurant, you can either order at the counter or sit down for full service. We decide to sit down. The waitress is attentive and takes our order. We order the spicy creamy chicken noodle bowl ($6.95) and the Chirashi sushi bowl ($10.50) with a taro boba tea drink ($2.75).The main dishes arrive soon after. The Korean spicy chicken is creamy, warm, and tenderly fried to perfection. The noodles are moist and flavorful and arrive in a large bowl. The Chirashi bowl comes with sushi rice, fresh and tasty pieces of salmon, tuna, white tuna, shrimp, and a side of seaweed salad, ginger, and wasabi. I devour the pieces of sashimi, licking the last pieces of sushi rice from the bowl. It is like sushi rolls but without the roll and in a bowl.for more please visit my blog, tastychomps.blogspot.com…"
1/7/2018,4,"Good place to grab a quick bento at downtown area. My favorite is their spicy creamy chicken bowl. Also make good use of their happy hours mom-fri from 4-7 pm：buy 2 rolls get 3rd free, or free appetizer for an entree"
10/11/2018,5,"Amazing bowls! Love the food always, one of my favorite spots to go to, we go on the weekly!"
3/11/2017,5,"I love Asian food and this is one of the best. We went to the Dr Phillips location on a Friday evening and there was a long wait for a table so we took a seat outside. We then went to counter inside to order then they deliver the food to your table. There are so many choices to choose from, rice bowls, noodle bowls or bento boxes as well as sushi. I chose a bento box which comes with steamed rice, Lo Me in, ginger salad, string beans plus an entree, I had pork katsu. My husband had a rice bowl with spicy red curry and a beer. The food as usual was great and it was so nice sitting outside on a warm Florida night in December."
1/3/2013,4,"A great place for a quick, cheap meal.Food - I categorize Bento Cafe as high class fast food. Very similar to Panera. You order and pay then you sit and eat. I always get a the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box. It usually comes with a small dessert which I always substitute for either rice or noodles. After reading some of the other reviews, I think I may have to try the spicy tuna don bowl as it sounds delicious. I love sushi, but have never tried theirs. Atmosphere - Chic and trendy.You can order and pick it up.Definitely a place to try out!"
4/30/2016,1,"I used to frequent this establishment (at least a couple times per month), but after my last couple times there it's safe to say I'm never going back and they'll never receive a single dollar that I've earned ever again. Let me start off by saying the food is pretty good, but not good enough for me to put up with their terrible customer service. When I went in the store during my last visit I ordered pickup and was not greeted for the first 5 minutes I was there. It doesn't take much energy to greet your customers when they walk into your restaurant.Today was the last straw for me. I was attempting to call in an order and was put on hold for 7 minutes. I completely understand if the store is busy, but in previous restaurant jobs I've had, if we were that busy we would get back on the phone with the potential customer after two minutes and would either ask for a phone number to call back or give them the expected wait time. I am never going back to Bento and will try my best to ensure none of my friends or family ever go back."
9/13/2011,4,"I used to eat here at least once a week when I was working at a law firm right across the street.  I get the same thing every time I go there....Spicy Cream chicken Bento box with all noodles and rice!  So delicious....and their miso soup is fantastic!You get so much food, you either end up over-eating because it's so delicious that you can't stop or you save half of it for lunch the next day.  It's also fairly cheap, which is an added bonus."
2/10/2017,1,This was the worst food experience I've ever had. I was told for a table of 6 our wait time was 15 minutes and the wait ended up being 45 minutes. As soon as my family and I got seated we ordered our food and drinks. We waited an additional 30 minutes and still no food. We had a movie at 9:45 so we just walked out. I didn't have a chance to eat the food but after this experience I don't think I'll ever come back to try the food.
8/22/2019,2,"I'm not one to complain.......and I understand mistakes happen.......but this is the 2nd time in a week that I've placed a to-go order only to get back to the office and realize that it's not correct.  First time, no salad dressing for the salad.  Today, not even CLOSE to the correct order; clearly someone else's order.  I like their food when it's what I order, but this is disappointing."
4/22/2015,4,"Been coming to Bento for lunch for a few years now.  I work in the building and when I need my sushi fix, this is it. It's not the sushi you might get at other, more expensive restaurants but it's fresh, and good.  The spicy tuna, salmon and tuna/salmon dons are great, with spicy mayo, and a little seaweed salad on the side, the fish is always fresh. The spicy cream chicken is another winner, although I can feel my arteries hardening as I eat it.  So it's a splurge for me when I get it.  For a healthier alternative try their Kawaii rolls, wrapped in rice paper and lettuce instead of rice and seaweed. There are five options with varying selections of fish and other ingredients.I usually order to go but when I've dined in it's been great using their check-in special of a free app with $10 purchase (which isn't valid with carryout) for the gyoza which I order fried and is sinfully tasty.  The service can be slow, but the food has always been good."
4/11/2018,3,"After waiting for an hour, the staff was kind enough to provide me my food FREE of charge. They apologized and made sure that I would not be charged for their mistake. Thanks Bento Café"
7/7/2018,5,"My husband and I went here on our Friday night date night. This place was excellent! The sushi is amazing. We had the hot lava roll, the volcano roll, and the Mexican roll! We loved every one of them!! So delicious and the service was great too! This will be a regular date night spot for us!"
7/6/2018,5,"I was here for dinner and everything was fantastic! My server Juan was great. He was very attentive and made sure I enjoyed my dining experience. I had the steamed chicken dumplings which are my new favorite appetizer. Followed by the noodle bowl (lol mein) with spicy cream chicken. The spicy cream is not very spicy which I like. With such amazing hospitality and inexpensive but delicious food, I will definitely be back."
6/26/2018,4,"Their bento boxes include a lot of food and a variety of options to choose from. The bento box includes a lot of different flavors, including spicy (if you choose the main dish to be spicy), salty, sweet (dressing on the salad), and a light dessert (it seems like some sort of fried chips in sweet sauce, tasted good). The service was fairly timely, and it is a good choice for a casual meal. Not too formal or quiet, because a lot of people were there for lunch."
10/4/2010,3,"This is a good place for fast and cheap sushi. If you go here expecting something fancy, you'll be very disappointed. My favorite is the spicy don. It's a bowl of rice with tuna or salmon (or both) and a spicy sauce. It's only $7 and they don't skimp on the fish. Plus, the best part is the boba tea!It's a good choice when you need a sushi fix, but don't have a lot of money."
3/21/2018,5,This is my favorite sushi place of all time. Everyone is always super friendly and the food is incredible!
10/5/2015,3,"Decent food at a price. Counter service to order and pretty quick turn around to food delivered to your table (like Jason's deli style). Good variety (large menu to choose from) at okay taste. It's quick food, and you can tell. Always seems to be busy, so finding a table can be tough. Best to get there early. Today the customer service was lacking -- the cashier gave me an attitude when I asked to substitute out the rice. She did, however, provide the option of double green beans and salad, which was nice."
5/1/2017,3,"So, they forgot to bring out the sushi, which was only remedied by me going to the bar after all the other food had been eaten to find our meals had long been sitting in the window.One of the servers brought it out saying he wasn't sure what was happening, but that he wasn't even  on the clock.To top it off, the guy at the register said they had ""run out"" of parking validation and suggested we go to another restaurant to get it validated, after I had paid for my family of 6 to eat at Bento.Thanks."
11/6/2017,5,Always a great place to grab a quick bite to eat or just get some good sushi. Bento Boxes are yummy! They have great kitchen entrees as well. Saki's are good too! Can't really go wrong here. I've been a fan for a long time. You won't be disappointed. They also have a good happy hour menu! Yum!
5/19/2018,5,"I had a great experience here. The food was really good, and came out with a very short amount of wait time even though we had 14 people in our group. Our server Valerie was pretty amazing too. She was very attentive but also not annoying and I guess she's only been on the floor for a month so her trainer did well also I believe her name was Sarah. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"
6/29/2011,5,"I really like this place because the quality and taste of the food in relation to its prices is simply astonishing. My favorite dish from the place is the rice bowl with seaweed salad and tuna. I cannot tell you enough how good it is. It combines the incredible flavor of seaweed with the tuna, and it's like boom... PERFECTION. If I can recall correctly, the dish costs you no more than $8.00. Their sushi is also good, not the best I've had but good. I like their Bagel Japanese Roll and Mexican Roll."
7/5/2012,3,"Let's start with the location: the restaurant is located in downtown Orlando right underneath the movie theatre. Parking isn't bad, as the garage is nearby and they validate parking. Just keep in mind the time because after two hours the validation is void and you end up paying the general parking fee. There aren't many businesses surrounding the restaurant so for it's location, it's pretty modern and trendy. Bento Cafe is known for its cheap sushi as well as its variety when it comes to the entrees. You can pick between three styles: Bento box, Noodle bowl, or Rice bowl. There's a variety of different styles of entrees, including Thai, Filipino, and Chinese. One thing I noticed is that they no longer have Boba drinks. I've been here a number of times and every time I never get the entrees. Mostly because I find that there are rolls here that I absolutely love and I can't find anywhere else. Another category on their menu that I love is their sushi bowls. Not many other restaurants offer a variety of sushi bowls and are usually limited to Chirashi bowls or Tuna Don. I'm pretty much a fan of their Spicy Tuna and Salmon Don, which I usually request come with brown rice. As far as their basic rolls, I love their Japanese Bagel Roll and Mexican Roll. I have yet to try their Special Mexican Roll, which I'm told is fantastic. As far as their specialty rolls, I really like their Caliente Roll. As if you couldn't already tell, I'm a sucker for spicy food. The reason why I'm not giving a full 4 or 5 stars to this restaurant is because sometimes their service is pretty hit or miss. It mostly has to do with how busy they can get at times. Although it's seat yourself service, sometimes the servers can be slow to get your orders as well as check in on you. The last time I went I'm pretty sure our waiter never checked on us unless we flagged him down. Although I've lived in Orlando for quite some time, I've yet to try the location at Dr. Phillips. Unfortunately for me, it's on the other side of town. Overall, I enjoy coming here with friends and we're just looking to have a good time. I feel like it's a good place to come to with people since there's a variety of food to order."
12/1/2016,3,went for lunch yesterday and ordered the Bulgogi beef add on veggies and a side of extra sauce. Now i had this same dish before and it was slamming! everything was phenominal but i forgot to review it. This time i went i ordered it to go and they forgot the sauce. BOOO i had to ask for it in an awkward way since there was a long line at the cashiers. I got the expediters attention and recieved my sauce. The beef was good and the veggies were cooked well. The sauce however was funky. It had a grittiness to it that i havent tasted before. Almost like powdered sand consistency. It killed the rest of the food. This was a one time thing on the 4 times i have visited. I hope they rectify this for future people. Given this i will still return because the other times i have been were good.
4/21/2018,5,This place never cease to amaze me I am just fond of the memories I have here from the iconic staff members to the delicate yet amazing hand made food
4/5/2015,5,"LOVE bentos. If you're looking for an inexpensive, but quality sushi place, bentos is your last stop. Everyone is always friendly, and I have never had a complaint on my food. I love that they stay open late also!"
12/13/2014,2,When you walk in the menu is at the front. The girl comes over and waits for you to make your decision on the spot before you sit down. It made us feel a little rushed to make all of our decisions. They seemed like they had a lot of great choices but because we were rushed I didn't get a chance to look at all of the sushi. I asked her a couple of questions to help me narrow down and she seemed really bothered. They charge you for the food immediately and I noticed she looked right away at how much of a tip was left. Another thing I didn't like. My first impressions wasn't great. Total for 3 rolls and 2 drinks came out to $48. We then sat down and served ourselves our drinks. That's pretty cool. The sushi was ok.  My best friend and I share a common love for sushi so we like to try different places. The volcano sushi was good. It did seem kind of plain but not disappointing. The Mexican roll was gross I suggest not to have it from here. We both stayed away from that side of our plate.
2/10/2015,5,"What can I say? I'm absolutely OBSESSED with this place. I've been to almost all of their locations and they're all outstanding. From service to quality, you can't get a better combo than this place.My typical go to is the Volcano roll, although during October around Halloween they have a Zombie roll that is, to say the least, amazing. I highly recommend this place if you're in a hurry as well as they kitchen is quite speedy at sending out dishes."
3/26/2015,5,Always a great place to grab a bite with friends. Place has great ambiance and good service. Their sushi rolls are very different from other places and tasty. Always enjoy their boba drinks.
3/31/2018,5,Service was nice and courteous. Food prices are decent. Quality and quantity of the food is fulfilling. Definitely a great place to eat
10/23/2015,5,Had an amazing recommendation of a sushi bowl with crab and tuna by my server Cortney. Amazing service and delicious food! Will definitely be back soon!
12/29/2017,5,Love this place! Couldn't find the menu online so I called and the manager talked me through the menu over so the phone so I could place my order. Super nice! I've only had their sushi and it's delicious. Recommendation: garlic edamame - delicious!!
3/26/2018,1,The seaweed on my sushi was extremely soggy and chewy and I had to spit it out. I also found bits of shrimp shell in my special Mexican roll.
10/5/2012,4,"I was a huge fan of Bentos in Gainesville, so I was happy to see they opened up a location in Orlando. Nice atmosphere, friendly people, and pretty good quality cheap sushi. It's a dream when you add in the fact that they have boba tea as well.The decor is kinda trendy, but not overly pretentious. At night there might be a wait, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth it. The udon soup is a huge, filling bowl of soft noodles, and the tempura that often comes with it is nothing to sneeze at either. I love the dragon roll wrapped in Unagi, my favorite fish. Is eel a fish? Who cares, it's delicious. Fun, cheap place to eat good quality sushi in Orlando. I'll be back. Just park a few blocks away and walk, the parking fee at the complex is in is killer."
7/7/2017,4,"I love the spicy cream chicken rice bowl! I love this place has both sushi and non-sushi options. I'm not a sushi fan but I can go here with my friends who are and everyone is happy. I usually go to the location in Doctor Phillips, so last night was my first time at this one. The location feels a little strange to me. I'm a suburbanite so this place being underneath the movie theater in a little tunnel felt a little dark to me. My chicken seemed a little crispier than normal, but maybe some people like it that way. The service was good, even if our waiter's jokes were a bit awkward. Loved the $1 off coupon for Mochi next door that they gave us with the check."
12/16/2017,5,The tuna poke bowl is the master of all things. I have ordered it countless of times and it always taste so savory each time. I'm not a fan of soybeans but I will eat a hand full of it if it's in the poke bowl
6/29/2015,4,"Just got back from Bento. It was a nice experience. We had 9 people in our party and our server handled the large party very well. We ordered rolls and entrees. They have a large selection of rolls to choose from. She brought our rolls out first before the entrees which was nice. I got the Mexican Roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). I would definitely recommend it. I also got the miso soup which is always very good. The place is kinda small but we fit comfortably. No one in our party had any problems or complaints. I took away one star because I wasn't absolutely blown away. However, if I had guests that were craving sushi I would certainly take them here."
3/6/2015,5,So I must say that I fully enjoyed my experience here the food was awesome. Got a Bento Box. It came out quick along side out spring roll appetizer which was free via Yelp check in. The teriyaki chicken was very tender and full of flavor and the ginger salad was a good top off to clean the pallet. Now I will fully talk up our wait staff Susan who was on top of our service. We were in a rush to catch a show and she made sure to keep on top of things ensuring we didn't feel rushed and out on time. Cudos to Susan probably one of the best wait staff experiences I have gotten from any place in a long time. All in all Bentos deserves these 5 stars.
6/7/2019,2,The place used to be full. Then they went to ordering at the counter. I hate this on a Friday night. Long wait. Wish whoever thought this was better than table service would rethink. If I wanted this experience I'd go to McDonald's
9/3/2017,1,"I'm not sure why this place gets good reviews. The lack of service this place has is interesting, you pay 1st and then sit down at a table with no server. It's like a school cafeteria with woks and sushi. When the food and hot tea was dropped off at the table- the server was a little rude. Literally ""DROPPED"" off at the table, the bowl it made a loud sound as it hit. The girl just walked away without saying anything. Maybe a ""can I get you anything else?"" Would suffice. Do I go to the cash register and ask for ""anything else""? Spoon, hot sauce, another napkin or ice water? Sushi roll was very small for  $11 also. Ehh, 1 star I guess"
9/2/2017,4,You can't go wrong with the sushi box. Just enough food for lunch or a light dinner. The location is perfect to grab a bite then head to the movies or somewhere else. The service can take a bit depending on when you come but a decent place for quick sushi.
3/12/2015,3,"Excellent lunch spot! I love the spicy cream noodle bowl, and when you check-in on Yelp, you get a free app. I can't attest to the sushi because I don't like fish, but the chicken menu items I have tried have been well-portioned, reasonably priced, and very tasty.Downside: Parking (not really convenient unless you are already downtown), the soda machine is frequently (like 50% of the time) out of gas for carbonation or syrup, and the food sometimes takes awhile to come out."
10/22/2017,4,"I love Bento. Their spicy cream noodle bowl never disappoints. Plus, their wait usually isn't too long and it's a nice atmosphere."
4/25/2010,3,"I was foraging for food in downtown Orlando and came upon this place.  Bento is like many places out there that like to fuse sushi with many other types of cuisine (thai, chinese etc.).  Always a dicey prospect in my book.  Either way, this place wasn't too bad.  The decor is decidedly trendy and modern.  Service was pretty fast and friendly.  The prices here are pretty reasonalbe.  Rolls are anywhere from $7-14.  I ended up with the steamed gyoza which was actually pretty tasty and affordable.  A nice sized bowel of I think 5 or 6 dumplings were like $4.50.  Also got the T.N.T. roll which was spicy tuna with tuna on the outside and a dragon roll.  Not a bad choice if you are hungry for more than sandwiches and flatbread in the downton O area."
3/25/2015,5,"One of my favorite lunch spots in Orlando. Can get a bit busy during normal lunch hours, so I'd suggest going around 11:30 to beat the rush. Bento box is awesome, lots of food and cheap too!! Their specialty rolls are good too! Their Mango Tango, Bali Hai Mango, and Dragon sushi rolls are delicious as well!"
7/23/2017,5,Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. We've been to multiple Bento cafes and this location by far is the best one.
9/11/2016,4,The crab wantons were tasty and served right out of the frywe. The Sechquan chicken was yummy with the right amount of  spice. Large portion and the service was good and friendly even though the restaurant was packed. I will return.
9/15/2017,5,"We were craving Japanese food so we stopped by Bentos in Downtown Orlando. OMG best decision ever!!! The best dish of the night was the Poke Bowl! The flavor reminds me when I was in Hawaii! The sushi rolls were delicious! So Fresh! If you haven't tried the Udon Stir Fry's, you don't know what you're missing! The steak Udon Stir fry was my favorite! Ryan the sushi chef was so personable and provided exceptional customer service! Kanpai!"
9/15/2017,5,It was our first time at this place but omg I the food was amazing! We sat at the bar and our sushi chef Ryan was absolutely amazing! Hes the greatest and I'm so happy we stopped by here!
3/21/2011,4,"Creamy Spicy Shrimp bowl!! YUM. I like the fact you can pick between bowls, noodles, or bento box. I chose the bowl. It came with Shrimp and rice. I think they gave a little too much rice but it was still very delicious! It taste like the orange chicken sauce but 10x better. The only thing I was disappointed about was the fact it wasn't spicy at all. But besides that it was great. I think next time I'd get the box because it comes with more side dishes.We also ordered the Salmon Nigiri which was very impressing. Super fresh and just melted in your mouth. I'd definitely come back here."
12/4/2011,3,"Had a party of 7 here on a Saturday night with no reservation.  So luckily, there was great conversations while waiting for a table to clear, because this place was packed.The beer prices are pretty decent here, had an Asahi and a Sapporo and they were a good dollar cheaper here than other places I've been.  A fellow diner had salt with an edamame garnish that she couldn't eat.  I love salt, so I was in heaven.........briefly, then had to quit myself.  Its good but yes, salt is here and fully represented.The seating is very cramped.  Several times throughout dinner, I'd see stranded patrons that went to the bathroom that couldn't make it back to the side of the room that they came from.I have a love/love relationship with inari sushi (the tofu pockets with the sweet sushi rice inside), and this place fixed them perfectly, and the price didn't break the piggy bank.  The red bean ice cream was well done as well,  if you are looking for a break from Mochi Fro-Yo that is neighboring this restaurant.The waitress deserves a special mention as well.  As packed and chaotic as this place was, you'd never notice it in her demeanor.  She was very sweet, offered recommendations over the techno and loud atmosphere.  I wish the receipt had her name, I'd leave it here.This place could totally climb a star if the space issues resolved!"
8/20/2012,4,"The more I come here, the more I try from the menu and the more I like it. I work in the building, and I am often in search of a healthy lunch option so Bento and I were bound to get acquainted.As Brandi B. said, the bento box can be a big ole' salt lick but I usually hit up the bowls - my favorite is the artistically presented chirashi sashimi bowl, a delicious rainbow of sashimi served over rice. The spicy tuna don is my standby bowl when I'm not feeling as feisty. And sometimes I just pop down here and get miso and/or seaweed salad, which is also good. Also, they have a Yelp special right now - free appetizer when you dine in and spend more than $10. Chirashi sashimi bowl is right at that price point. Just sayin'..."
6/22/2017,5,"Casey was awesome at the register. Super helpful accommodating my vegan requests, super sweet. Food was great. Will definitely visit again!!"
4/18/2017,5,"Sushi sushi sushi!! Delicious!! Had the Miami and Bamboo rolls. Previously visited this restaurant back in February and tried their ""Bento box"". Would totally recommend either one. Delishhh!!"
12/10/2011,5,yum yum yum!I love this place and wish there was one in Tampa. This place is a little difficult to find parking since it's in downtown Orlando but once you find a spot it's not hard to find. This one looks really fancy compared to the one in Gainesville but it's really affordable. They have really good food and also specials on certain days. Sushi and bento boxes? What else could you ask for! They give you a pretty good amount of food too.Oh and there's TV's in the bathroom :)
8/8/2017,1,"Paying $11 for a build your own Poke Bowl, with lots to pick from including a choice of rice or lettuce but seriously you can't get half of each?  This is a service industry...this restaurant should grasp the service part...come on."
1/13/2018,4,Was in town on vacation and ordered to-go through uber-bites and got the chicken curry katsu and tuna/salmon/crab rice bowl. Tasted pretty good even though it wasn't uber(haha get it? :D) fresh! Good portion sizes too!
1/1/2015,5,"Good sushi for a good price, right in downtown so perfect place for dinner. They also have rice or noodle bowls and bento boxes."
3/9/2017,1,"I've been going to lunch at Bento for a number of years, but their quality has taken a nose dive.  Today I ordered the create-your-own don with yellowtail.  Most of the fish was inedible - weird consistency and not fresh.  So instead of having sushi for lunch, I ended up with a very big bowl of expensive rice for lunch. Very disappointed."
10/2/2017,5,"Tonight was my first time at Bento and I stopped in for dinner. The food was awesome and not ill priced for how full I walked out of the restaurant. My server Amber was terrific, nice and attentive and the rest of the staff was great too!!"
1/21/2015,5,A little pricey but I absolutely love the sweet and sour shrimp rice bowl.   Call in order and pick up often for lunch fast and always accurate.
6/22/2017,1,"Really disappointed with Bento Cafe. I Ordered lunch with my friend and he finish his food and there was no sign of mine. No actual servers at all, after waiting for 20+ minutes I finally got the two rolls I order and they didn't even care to bring chopsticks, just really bad service. No one seems to care if you're here or not. Probably not coming back."
11/12/2014,4,"Bento is one of my go-to restaurants of choice in downtown Orlando. It's not super cheap, but you do get quite a bit of food for your money and it's generally pretty good quality. In half a dozen visits I've only had one where the service was mediocre-- in fact, if my experience stands up, I'd suggest visiting at lunch on a weekday! The first thing I try at any Asian/Asian Fusion restaurant is always General Tso's chicken. Bento's was good, but it was a little too deep-fried for my taste and they went a little heavy on the sauce. I've since tried the pad thai bento box (very good) and the garlic soy steak rice bowl (also very good) and have resolved to stick to non-fried foods here for the most part. All in all, you can certainly find better Asian Fusion restaurants in Orlando-- but I've enjoyed just about every meal I've had at Bento all the same! Great downtown lunch spot."
11/6/2014,4,"Most of the Bentos I've been to (in Gainesville and Jacksonville) are usually more of a fast foodish type of restaurant but this one in Orlando is more catered for full sit in dining. The ambiance is nice and it's smack dab in the middle of downtown next to all the great bars and the movie theater. The menu is good and the prices are great for the service and the quality of food. At night they have dinner service so it's different from the usual 'seat yourself/self service' type of deal. The only thing is they have only 1 bathroom for each male/female. With the amount of people they have in the restaurant at once you'd think they would have more bathroom stalls. But other than that, the food is good for the price and the location is great. Solid 3.5!"
6/9/2015,4,"I have never been disappointed with lunch @ Bento in the dozen or so times I've been. If you want affordable, the sushi box or bento boxes they offer are all great value and even better flavor. The executive rolls are spot on and worth their cost for what you get. If you're not a fan of the raw, go with a Miami or Spider roll and you won't be disappointed! The Mongolian beef bento box is a must have a some point while you're there.Highly recommend getting there before 11:30am on weekdays as it gets incredibly packed by noon."
6/1/2017,4,So delicious!!! Spicy cream noodle bowl is the best  this place is definitely bigger than the other bentos and in a great location. You have to pay for parking in the garage or drive around downtown to find parking- the only annoying part.
10/21/2016,4,"If you are in downtown Orlando and looking for a fresh meal, this is a great spot to check out. They have a great selection of sushi as well as entrees. I really like their teriyaki chicken bowl and usually get the edamame for an appetizer. Try the edamame with garlic seasoning. It's really good! They have good happy hour specials and the staff is friendly."
8/24/2017,5,"A really nice surprise. Real good food, the staff is nice and efficient. I recommend coming here!"
8/24/2017,5,Great food and sushi. Service can be slow only because it's always packed. Get here before the lunch rush and dinner rush and you'll be fine.
10/27/2014,4,"I love Bento- great sushi, amazing curry katsu, affordable prices. They have lots to choose from as far as food and the boba tea and sake is lovely. The food had been consistently yummy all but one time (I've been about 8 times) however, that one time it seemed very unfresh. I told my waiter and he brought the manager who simply told me ""the chef could be using a different recipe."" Yeah... I think that's unlikely. No offer to fix it or give me a discount or coupon of any kind. He just left. (This was the sandlake location btw) I felt a little betrayed. So normally you can expect super yummy food, but not so great customer service. Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars."
4/18/2017,5,Great!!! Loved it! It was soooo delicious and fair prices!! I got the ahi tuna bowl and it almost melted in my mouth!
3/11/2017,5,"Came into Bento on a Friday night and was seated without a wait. Our server Sylvia was attentive and so nice! We got happy hour which is 4-7pm bogo beer, wine, and house sake and buy two sushi rolls get a classic roll free. What a BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! The sushi rolls were fresh delicious fish and the krab wontons are to die for. Alex brought out our food and he was also extremely nice asking us if we needed any extra sauces or drink refills. All the other staff members we came in contact with were also extremely nice. The atmosphere is young and lively. Overall my bento experience was impeccable and we will be back!"
11/4/2014,5,Our server (Kiki) was really helpful and had the cutest personality. So many great choices! We started out with Krab Cheese Wontons and Shrimp Tempura. Got a couple of rolls which I loved the *Special Mexican Roll. Great quick service!
5/28/2015,4,"Bento cafe is coollllll! I love this location it's right underneath the movie theater so it's ideal to catch a flick before or after. Even if your just passing by and in the mood for thai food. If you come and your not looking for sushi (which I'm sure is good here) you must get a bento box! Includes rice, noodles, salad, string beans, desert, and your entree choice of meat! The spicy cream chicken is to die for not spicy at all maybe a tad if anything but so so good. I wish they would be a little more heavy handed with the noodles but hey all that for like 9 bucks I can't complain! The seating can get crammed if your not in a booth so be aware of that! Besides that I super recommend this place! I look forward to trying their new location at ucf! Go bento!"
9/11/2016,5,Great location and ambiance. The parking garage could be better. Their happy hour from 4-7pm is a great value! BOGO sushi never fails.
2/20/2017,5,"Their miso soup is haunted. Not as in ""I'm haunted by their miso soup"" rather, their miso soup is literally moved by spirits."
6/9/2016,3,"I was not the biggest fan of this location. I did enjoy the food but the service didn't really live up to the expectation. I went there for dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in a little while and we wanted to catch up. Our waiter, however, didn't give us any breathing room. Kept coming back asking if we were ready to order and almost seemed to be rushing us. I didn't understand why the staff was rushing us. Happy hour was already over and no one was really there. There was no reason to rush us. The food however, was pretty good. I ordered the rainbow roll, the mt. fuji roll, and the alaska roll. They were all very good. I also ordered a noodle bowl for work the next day. I really enjoyed that as well. Make sure you are not in a rush, the service and food did take a little while to arrive. The food was good, the service not so much. I'd go back but probably order my food to go next time."
7/12/2017,5,"Came here on Monday night for a late bite to eat and got to say we were thoroughly impressed from the food and service quality. There was a little bit of a wait for the sushi, but our server let us know in advance, which we appreciated. Let me tell you though, it was worth the wait. The sushi was extremely fresh and the roll integrity exceeded our expectations, delicious! A woman with blonde hair (I'm assuming was the manager), cheerfully brought out our rolls, described them to us, and asked if we needed anything else. A nice added touch was she came back around to check on how we were doing and refilled our drinks. It was cool to see the wait staff helping each other out to make the customer's dining experience a memorable one. We will definitely be back to try more rolls."
2/28/2016,4,Came on a Tuesday night before a show at Dr Phillips the place was very busy and just missed happy hiur :( Had to wait for a table but the service was very quick and made up for the wait time. Thought it was odd they had a table reserved but no one showed up for the 45 min we were there. The noodle bowls were delicious and asked for extra white (yum yum) sauce and eel sauce on the side.
12/1/2013,5,"Went back... After Shari too expensive, me only, non team atmosphere at Amura...Asked my server at sushi bar for make a bento, just hamachi (yellowtail), large sashimi cut, not diced, extra meat and it was outstanding, fresh and brightly affordable...Ordered Tako (cooked octopus) (sashimi) it was great, expertly cut, crisp wuth great texture.Green tea ice cream was ample, smooth and creamy...The team service was as good as service gets...My server was the GM, Alex from Venezuela, she us outstanding professional...Alex said she revamped the staff in late October ...Great visit one of my very best in Orlando...Up there with Kres, Shari and The Palm..."
4/21/2017,4,"I LOVE this place, been going to it for years. The only downside is the food quality isn't always consistent. The last two times I went, my tofu had a subtle freezer burn taste but other than that, great astmophere and food."
1/2/2019,5,"I Miscommunication and order, they were very helpful in getting me back on track. Great customer service. Thanks, manny"
10/15/2016,4,The food is reasonable and fast however it lacked the authentic Asian seasonings associated with a bento box. However we tried the pumpkin wantons and they were a hit with my group.  I probably would visit another location see if the food is a little better.
3/22/2017,5,"Very busy at lunch but food is good and reasonably priced, Szechuan beef noodle soup and veggie spring rolls were both tasty and big portions, right under the movie theater in Cobb Plaza downtown"
3/17/2017,5,This is by far the most consistent place for quality sushi in Orlando.  The staff is always very friendly.  I happen to be within walking distance and rarely wait to be seated.  Quality food and a great location!
12/17/2017,2,"I'm giving two stars because the food is pretty good and because I generally have a good enough experience at lunch or when I order takeout. HOWEVER, two of my friends and I went for dinner tonight and were treated so poorly. At dinner, this Bento location feels the need to pretend to be fancy and have waiters bring food instead of having people order at the counter. That would be fine if any of the staff appeared to be trained for that. The service started poor and only got worse. The soda came out flat and, when we asked our waiter about it, he said the CO2 was out and he'd get us new sodas when it was fixed. We waited 10 minutes before asking him about the soda. He told us he ""didn't know"" whether the soda had been fixed, but that ""it doesn't look like anyone has touched the machine."" We asked for waters instead. It took another 10 minutes for our waters to come. In the meantime, our waiter got drinks for other tables and played around on the register. Later, about 30 minutes after ordering food, we were informed that there was a problem with the kitchen and that our food was delayed. While we waited, the seemingly-large staff all stood around looking confused. It took a total of about 40 or 45 for the food to come. In the meantime, the table behind us left and the server was obviously rude to them as they did. It was really awkward. We were never offered anything for the extensive wait, lack of carbonated drinks, or terrible service."
2/10/2017,5,"The service I receive here supersedes my expectations with Kevin the sushi man, always smiling and making sure perfection. Always reaches my table. He ensures everything is the same and super seeds company standard he is someone who should be emulated and Nicole and Sheri supported his service to maximize my experience. When I came johnna  also made me say wow with the service she gave."
1/9/2017,5,I love this place! The bento boxes are perfect for when you want variety- aka- the spice of life! They have small servings of noodles rice salad veggies and even dessert with your entree choice. I like the fact that I get a little bit of everything.  I have eaten in the restaurant but the last time I ordered through uber eats and the food was just as good. Overall good but I would suggest being careful about when you show up to all you can eat sushi- if you show up too close to the end they wont let you join in.
5/20/2016,1,"Didn't get what I ordered, but the employee left so quickly I didn't get a chance to say anything. I'd waited so long and I was so hungry that I just ate what was brought and left."
1/1/2016,4,"Been to their Gainesville location and usually get curry Katsu chicken noodle bowl. Entre was decent, other location usually gives more sauce so felt it was kinda dry, still tasted fine but I personally prefer more sauce since I like spicy taste."
12/12/2016,5,"My boyfriend and I had an incredibly satisfying meal at Bento. After a long day at the parks, we were craving fresher and healthier food and found Bento after searching downtown for something that fit the bill. We both ordered bento boxes and split an order of edamame and a cucumber avocado roll. The bento boxes come with a salad, lo mein, string beans, rice, an entree, and a small dessert item. My boyfriend got the garlic soy chicken and I got the vegetable stirfry with tofu. Both of our meals were delicious! We enjoyed our meal so much we returned the next night!Bento Cafe was the perfect meal after a long day. The food was very fresh and the price was excellent. We both were satisfied and spent less than $30. We highly recommend Bento for those looking for a great meal in dowtown Orlando."
5/29/2015,2,"Oh, Bento Café, I had such high hopes for you.  I had eyed the Bento Café location in Gainesville while there on business but my coworker chose another dinner option, but I kept Bento in mind.  The concept of the menu - different meat and sauce selections for a wide range of Asian dishes with bento box-style options for all - sounded so amazing.  I visited this location with my Mom and husband for a pre-hockey dinner.  We started with Krab Wontons and fried chicken dumplings.  The wontons were good, but a bit heavy on cream cheese.  As for the dumplings, they were wonderfully crisped on the outside, but the filling was a little underseasoned.  However, the dipping sauce was quite good.  For entrees, we had quite a mix at our table, though we all went for the bento style serving.  My mother did the Red Curry with chicken, I did the Mongolian Beef and my husband went for the Bulgogi with beef.  Unfortunately, here's where the problems started.  The Red Curry, which my mother wanted fairly hot, simply was not and was overall a muddled curry without prominent flavors.  My Mongolian beef was supposed to come in a sweet hoison sauce but what I got was sickly sweet and didn't taste much like hoison.  My husband's bulgogi came in a sauce with additional ""Korean bbq"" sauce on the side.  I have no idea what the side sauce was supposed to taste like but it was much more like an American BBQ sauce than anything vaguely Korean.  He ended up asking for a different sauce on the side as the provided sauce didn't taste good on it's own or with the seasoned beef.  The additional items included on the bento were okay, but nothing amazing.  In the end, NONE of us finished our portions as the sauces were just not good and grew worse in flavor as we ate.  It's a sad day when none of us finish our dinner and we ended up getting a snack halfway through the game.  Oh well, I guess on a high note, I'm not sad anymore that we don't have one of these in Tampa."
7/2/2018,1,"I ate lunch with my husband today at bento cafe. I ordered the lunch sushi combo and he got a  teriyaki pork bowl. His food came out at least 10 minutes before mine. I wasn't mad about it but it was a little awkward. Fast forward 1/2 way through the meal, and he found a sharp piece of plastic in his food. A server quickly took the bowl away and offered to have the food re-made. We would have rather talked with the manager or had the food taken off our bill because unfortunately the food wasn't good to begin with. The California and rainbow rolls I got are best described as ""very ok"". I also got a philly roll, which contains smoked salmon, but they made it with imitation krab instead. I really dislike conflict and leaving poor reviews, but our whole experience at bento was so dissatisfying and gross. Spend your money at a different downtown sushi spot."
7/1/2016,2,"It makes me sad to do a two star review... Honestly, the food is good 95% of the time. The service however... I'm not even talking table service-I live in the plaza so I order takeout often. I have waited 40 minutes in store after 20 minutes or pre-ordwring because they refused to check the bag that had been ready since I walked in to see if it was my order. Whaaaatttt?? Today I call, yes, 15 minutes before they close but based on that one experience, I know their door stays open... They tell me no take out. I can only do counter service at the restaurant. I tell them where I live... They apologize and say oh well. So I ask if I can order downstairs. Sure can. Ok---seems weird. I make it before they lock their door a few minutes early. They do seat those who come in ten minutes before their closing, which made me wonder why they wouldnt do take out. They also claim you can get one sauce per meal, but if you order to-go, they'll only give you one if you ask in advance. So wait until you've ordered and paid so they HAND IT to you separately. Otherwise, it'll not be in your bag."
6/16/2013,4,"My second time here but now making a review. This place is sort of small and if you are scared of tight places then its not the place for you. I tried the garlic mushroom... with carrots, mushroom and add shrimp in a rice bowl... Just like they have back home in Pennsylvania at all the asian buffets. Sadly down here most restaurants don't have it on their menu. The shrimp was a good kind and not the horrible stuff with the extra string you get at most asian restaurants.This place is really good and competitively priced. Its a shame they don't have more of a space. They make do with the room they have but still. Its hard to find a decent asian restaurant around here.Sushi rolls were priced between $8 - $10 and had a wide selection. There is something for everyone here even if you are like me and hate soy sauce and chopsticks."
11/7/2014,5,I love bentos!!! They have amazing sushi and bento boxes!!! They get super busy at lunch! Nice location/right in down town.
12/31/2013,4,"Bottom line - great place for a nice lunch downtown.While I found the sushi here to be pretty good, I love the bento boxes.  My favorites are the Bulgogi beef and chicken teriyaki.  The place can get pretty crowded for lunch and dinner, but service is generally good and the food is prepared quickly.  Overall, no complaints from me about Bento."
5/27/2016,2,"Their food is decent, but the service is horrible.  The last time I went to grab lunch with my boyfriend there were 3 employees gathered at the front and ignored us for a few minutes, finally one of the girls told us to seat ourselves (despite the Please Wait to Be Seated sign they had up).  When we found our seat we watched the waiter walk by us several times, make eye contact and continue to ignore us.  By the way, there were not many other customers in the place at the time so they definitely weren't too busy.  After waiting almost 30 minutes to be acknowledged we stopped him as he was going to walk by us again and he told us ""I didn't know you were there"" I could go on and on but long story short, worst service experience I've had in a very long time.  The other times I've been there weren't much different. Good luck w/ this place."
6/9/2015,1,"Used to love love Bento until recently when I wanted to take a more healthier approach to my sushi rolls.  Any other sushi place would gladly substitute the rice for cucumbers-not bento! I was told the chef can't do that anymore bc it takes to much time and the only roll your allowed to have cucumber on is the ""k"" roll. Not a happy customer. Our waitress was very kind and polite, but was so sad I couldn't get my sushi roll substituted for cucumbers.  Sorry bento but I will not be returning this was the second time I was denied. - so many other great spots that will bend over backwards to make customer healthy and happy."
6/29/2016,5,"Awesome happy hour specials from 4-7.  Buy one, get one appetizers, rolls and drinks.  We went twice last week.  Excellent chicken dumpling and I love the special Mexican roll.  Crab Rangoon is decent, but I would only buy on BOGO.  Good customer service and in the heart of downtown."
6/29/2013,4,"This is one of my favorite places in Orlando!  I've been here probably over a dozen times.  It's pretty inexpensive and has a cool atmosphere.  I love going here for dinner before catching a movie upstairs at the Plaza Cinema.To start, I usually get the garlic edamame and miso soup.  You can't go wrong with one of their Bento boxes, which comes with a small salad, tiny dessert, noodles, main entree, and rice, all for eight dollars!  My favorite bento boxes include the pork tonkatsu and the coconut curry.  Their sushi is great as well.I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good mixed-asian restaurant downtown.The only downside is the seating area is kind of cramped.  Some of the tables are put together too closely."
10/1/2009,4,"Boba Teas! I love them! This is actually the first thing I think about Bento, not their sushi.  If you are a fan of Boba/Bubble Teas, Bento is where you need to be.  The key here is to try try more, and explore, and open your senses to all sorts of flavors.  Instructions on how to order a Boba Tea: 1) Pick whether you want milk, green, red or thai tea 2) Choose whether or not you want to add pearls (I like to call them ""balls"" - they are made from a mixture of tapioca and carrageenan powder). These fall to the bottom of your drink, but with each sip you taste several pearls. 3) Choose your Boba flavor: Banana, Chocolate, Peach, Coffee, Mango, Pineapple, Strawberry4) Then enjoy the essence of an eclectic tea made just for you. You won't want to stop! In addition Bento has tons of different types of rolls and dishes as they are known to be ""Asian Fusion"" type of food, but don't leave there without a Boba Tea. Just from writing this, I think I am going to create a gathering to do a tasting of different boba teas :)"
7/14/2009,3,"We stumbled upon Bento Cafe as it was one of the handful of late night options when we were starved and wandering the streets of downtown Orlando.Asian fusion usually leads down treacherous or comfortable paths and we were equipped for either.We definitely weren't going anywhere near the sushi, but the noodle bowls, rice bowls and otherwise nonrisky offerings certainly fit the late night bill.  I didn't take the decor to be indicative of the quality or price point of the food. It's fast food playing dress up. It looks hip and trendy, but It's meant to be casual and cheap. Portions were generous and two adults ate dinner for $15. No complaints from this critical Yelper. The cheery and friendly service definitely enhanced our experience."
9/23/2012,3,"We chose Bento Cafe because it was the only logical, pre-drunk place to eat at between 55W and our destination of I-Bar. We were celebrating a friend's birthday, and with each passing year one gains wisdom, specifically the knowledge that it's good to lay down a solid foundation in the gut before filling it up with cheap liquor.The food is good and cheap. I enjoyed a bento box filled with General Tsao's chicken, white rice, noodles, ginger salad, overcooked green beans and a tiny little cake. I also had a Mexican Roll (tempura shrimp, avocado, eel sauce) that was a little on the stingy side considering it cost $6.50. The Chinese food was just a notch better than what you would get at any walk-up place, but my friends' noodle bowls looked delicious. I was uncomfortably full and happy for less than $15.The saving grace is the food, because this place is just off somehow. The space is tiny and hot as Hell. Honestly, so many tables are packed in that it has to be a fire code violation. I often had to scoot my chair in to let somebody squeeze past me to use the bathroom, an annoyance because I'm not much of a scooter.Service is also bizarre. Our waitress was either tripping on mushrooms or had just arrived from another planet. There were times where she would stand at the edge of our table not saying a word and looking at us in disbelief as if she couldn't believe we were really there. She brought us the wrong food, realized her mistake, and took it away so it could be given to the proper diners (she trusted that we hadn't sneezed on it). In the end, she decided not to charge us for our beers and sodas for some reason I wasn't really listening to, so we tipped her. The one thing I may never forgive Bento Cafe for is the bathroom. It was a tragedy. I had to wipe myself with a paper towel, Bento Cafe. A paper towel! I flushed said paper towel in case you're having some plumbing issues.This place is good for large, cheap portions. Just make sure you bring your own toilet paper."
6/1/2009,4,"Bento initially opened in Gainesville around 2002 and I became a fan back then, because it was cheap and it was good--but you have to understand why it's good. Needless to say, I was happy when it opened in Orlando.I think people who give it low ratings just don't understand what the restaurant is all about. Sure, they're look like a dine-in upscale place now because of the decoration and location, but Bento is just Asian fusion FAST food. As far as I know they make no claims to fine dining.Bento is great for what it is: the cooked dishes. They have their version of a bento box, noodle bowl, or rice bowl. The menu has a variety of selections ranging from Japanese to Thai, like curry katsu (with their own sauce) , japanese curry, seafood soup, spicy seafood, vegetables, pork, chicken, five spice pork, etc... The spicy stuff there is generally good. I like the spicy gyoza (dumplings).Did I mention that it's all under $10??? Yes, that means two noodle bowls are under $16. It's completely worth it for a casual meal.Don't go there to get sushi--if you do, that's your mistake. But then again, I am picky about sushi and prefer to go to a real Japanese restaurant for that. I've only tried their chirashi (pieces of sashimi on a bowl of rice) before, which for the price was worth it (it's $9-10 I think...they changed prices recently), as it accompanies beer well. If you fancy rolls maybe you should try it and let me know what you think, as they have a wide choice of rolls. (But beware as this is where the pricing goes up.) Reiterating my opinion once more, sushi is not what they're about. They're about all the fast food I love from east Asia and can't find here....As for the cleaninless and service, I do agree that they need to clean the tables a little better. But given that I usually eat there during self-service hours, I don't mind too much, as I am not forced to tip.I never had a problem with the service though I understand the comment about the alacrity of the waitstaff. I recommend you try again. The food is usually ready quickly."
6/8/2009,3,"So we visited Bento again, and this time we tried more of the sushi rolls. I have decided that if you stick to the rice and noodle bowls the place earns 4 stars. The sushi earns 2 stars. If you haven't had good sushi you'll be satisfied with the sushi at Bento. I thought it was bland and prepared without much skill. In fact, we found a shrimp tail in one bite where there shouldn't have been one! Rolls are loose and the ingredients are not as fresh as at other sushi restaurants nearby. I still like the noodle bowls best, and they are a good price for what you get. The bowls aren't anything fancy but they are tasty. Don't bother with the sushi and you'll leave happy. Tip for parking... The restaurant is only given a certain number of validation tickets for the garage. When they are gone they're gone. Make sure you ask for yours at the beginning of the meal; we got the last one of the night! And they should do something about what the play on their TVs. For 30 minutes I was forced to watch a belly dancing infomercial. Everywhere I looked I saw it, even in the bathroom! It was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the conversation! Horrible!!"
1/21/2016,5,"So yummy! I got the shrimp tempura (was not warm, which I am used to but still very good), chicken tempura  (def exceeded my expectations and was my favorite), and California roll (good simple backup just in case :) ). It was buy 2 rolls get 1 free, so of course I had to get 3. Not expensive and very nice atmosphere :)"
3/12/2018,5,"I go to this location all the time. Tonight my order was incorrect. I called back and Casey was so kind as to correct it, give me a credit, and all while having the KINDEST demeanor. Thank you for your pleasant service. You have retained a loyal customer. See you soon!"
3/1/2015,4,This is a pretty good Bento. They have a variety of food here but the restaurant is normally packed. So expect a little bit of a wait. I like this Bento because it is a good location and is pretty much within walking distance of most of the major sites in downtown.  I am completely vegan and have severe food allergies and I mention this so you will know what my perspective is when I review this restaurant.  They have several different vegan options for you enjoy.  I enjoyed the sushi and the rice bowls.  They have a sweet sake that is amazing here of course I can't remember the name. Be careful if your vegetarian or vegan because some of their rice and noodle bowls although they say vegetarian actually have meat stock in them. If you inquire to your server as to which ones have the stock in it you can successfully make your choice.
8/3/2010,2,"This place was not what I expected.  It's in a pretty ""trendy"" location and it looks expensive.  So my first surprise was that it's actually pretty cheap.  I ordered a Bento Box (combo platter) with a selection of a few different ""easy"" rolls - California, Tuna, Philly, etc.  The problem was that I could not identify what roll was what by taste.  They ALL tasted like a dried out, Publix-quality-sushi, bland roll.  The only flavor that they had was the soy sauce and wasabi that I dipped them in.One bonus - they will validate your parking.  That's the only good thing about this place.  I was sorely disappointed by my experience here!"
11/8/2015,4,"I love everything on their menu. And their fish is such good quality. Everything is super delicious, and super fresh. I've never had anything that I didn't like on their menu. This location and the one by Universal Studios are both great."
8/11/2018,5,Excellent service. Love the food and the server was great with us. Juan got a excellent recommendation sushi and everything.
8/18/2009,1,"Bad food. Bad service.Even if the food & service were good, the music is so loud you wouldn't be able to hear your company, anyway.I had the coconut curry chicken rice bowl, and while the rice was fine (how can you mess up rice?) - the curry chicken was terrible. It smelled like a port-o-potty. It was so repulsive that smelling it made me lose my appetite all together. Gross. My friend had General Tso's chicken bento plate...it was ok. The meat just didnt taste fresh. I was hoping that after my dinner did not turn out - that maybe it was only mine, and that my friend's would be in the so/so range...but no, not really. The service was terrible. Took 20 minutes to take drink orders, the food took forever to come out and it was low quality when it did- I mean, if you spend that long making something, shouldn't it be good? Oh, and they never did the stop-by-check-on-you thing, to see how everything is going/refill water/etc. If they did, maybe I could have ordered something else....(ha, and been let down)I do need to clarify that the people who did finally come around to serve were friendly - its the taste and timing of it all that was so horrible. Would not return. Would not recommend. This is more like fast food chinese...but even that has tasted better than this place."
8/10/2009,3,"Casual sushi/fusion in the heart of the new Plaza downtown.After some deliberation, I decided to try the sushi and settled on the Envy roll and the Mt Fuji roll. The sushi was adequate but not phenomenal, especially compared to nearby Amura (a favorite) and Ichiban. Better than Publix and Bikkuri for sure.The atmosphere is very come-as-you-are, which may lend itself to more downtown traffic, but it's not a great place to take a date you want to impress. The clear plastic solo cups they serve your drinks in is a major no-no in my book. Are we at a picnic here? Service was pretty good.I'll go back to try the noodle bowls, but I may skip the sushi. Recommended if you're under dressed for a more upscale sushi/asian fusion experience, or as part of your movie going experience in the attached theater. They validate parking for the adjacent garage, and there are happy hour specials everyday as well."
2/1/2012,3,"This place was pretty ok. it felt like the Olive Garden of sushi restaurants. Smack in the middle of busy downtown, the decor isn't that fantastic, the service is friendly enough but the food felt assembly line processed and preserved. It's good enough if you're looking for some cheap-ish sushi downtown. I'll probably end up there again."
4/22/2013,4,"Me and the GF spend at least 2-3x/month at Bento. Good food, great price, great atmosphere. I have tried lots of things here but my faves are:Spicy Tuna Don (like a deconstructed sushi roll in a bowl)Kuwaii rolls (sushi wrapped in lettuce that taste good and are low carb)Red Curry Chicken (spicy and DELISH)Pad ThaiRangoons appetizer (great way to start a meal)Pot stickersSpecial Mexican rollMexican roll (yea we like these and they're good for non-sushi people)General Tso's (can you ever go wrong with this)Noodle bowls (preferably with the aforementioned red curry chicken...it ROCKS)Garlic edamameThat is an unofficial list and have had more but I can say that I am never unhappy with the spicy tuna don and a Mexican roll."
3/25/2015,3,"Love Bento Cafe, but this last time my daughter and I ate here prior to seeing Harry Connick Jr in concert, and the wait time was RIDICULOUS. The waitress was amazing and went a long way towards improving my mood, however"
1/5/2011,4,"This is a perfect pre-goingoutdowntown dinner spot, especially for the ladies. Most of the food is pretty light so you won't be bloated when leaving Bento and you'll still feel and look fab in those skinny jeans. Did I really just say that? Anyways, one of my favorites is the ""low carb"" Kawaii Rolls. They have no rice and no seaweed but are wrapped in lettuce and rice paper. It's a quick, fast, and cheap sushi place. Food is good, service is *usually* fast and accurate, and the atmosphere is pretty chill, except for on the weekends. It can get pretty packed and noisy in there on a Friday or Saturday night. They usually have drink specials Thursday - Sunday, not sure about food, it's already so cheap anyways."
4/18/2010,5,"Bento what can I say.  Everything about this place works for me.  I have been going to Bento for a few years now.  They have great lunch specials and the sushi is always fresh.  This is the type of place you can walk in, hand them a sum of money and let the chefs get creative.  I know this from experience.  Every time I walk in, they acknowledge me and my sushi is always on point.  The staff is very attentive, and the chefs are awesome.  I take my friends here all the time and great for groups.  The sake and beer selection is great too!  Make sure to try a Bento box or any of the Executive rolls!"
11/7/2015,3,"Decent. Got the chirashi bowl and a side of the shrimp tempura. Not the best sushi, but not the worst either.I'll add it to my list of places to eat sushi in downtown Orlando, though!"
4/11/2012,1,"I came to THIS Downtown location because I had fantabulous times and the Dr. Phillips location. I figured hey it's 9 miles from me, it should be stellar too. When I went by myself it was excellent. It was a  late lunch, the waitress in a good-customer-service style, was timely and attentive. Regular great service you should expect.WARNING the following is pretty brutal and true story: Rate [ I ] for IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!Soooo I bring my friends to the restaurant a few weeks later. They love sushi and Asian fusion food. Both are Asian (one Filipino and the other Korean)  they know their  home flavors. We got to our seats fairly quickly. Time to order the drinks. We wanted boba tea drinks but for some reason they sent us out to buy the drinks next door at the yogurt shop(which seems to be all under the same umbrella of business) that was a definite turn off because at the Dr. P location they have the boba drinks in the menu (as they did also at this location at the time) but we made the best of it, hey its a ladies night.Finally when we returned, I ordered a chicken rice bowl- that I will get into shortly- and my favorite kawaii rolls. My friends both ordered sushi and bento boxes.  The sushi and kawaii rolls was very good and at great prices $7-$9.After a few moments I see my friends slowing their pace of eating their food. I asked ""is your food good?"" and in a clenched smile, my friend said "" Yeah its ok""(to apparently be polite)  I told her ""Girl you aint fooling anyone, you are upset"" and she confessed that it wasn't the right flavor. It was supposed to be Korean spicy pork and it tasted bland and more American-Chinese in seasoning (she is a great Korean cook, she knows her stuff).  I totally get that it's fusion but it is still disappointing.Then that opened the door to my other friend admitting that she too was disappointed with her meal... She has high blood pressure and the food was too salty to her taste. You think it stops there, but when it rains it pours. Three catastrophes is the charm. I am eating my TASTY rice bowl when I find... tun tun tun A HAIR! Yes a less than an inch long straight black hair (I'm a hair dresser's daughter , grew up in family salons, I KNOW HAIR) I am a reasonable person I try to look at both sides of a story or 3 or 5! I thought ""is it my hair?"" I don't want to jump to any unnecessary conclusion. The oddity of it was that it was within the rice, not on top or on the side and at the time I had curly dark brown long hair with no bangs. (I feel like I am giving an eye-witness account to the foodie--cops) after discussing it with the girls and getting their opinion we decided to talk to our Ambivalent waiter(whom may or may not have been his first day on the floor on his own), then informed him of our unhappiness and the HAIR! He called his Manager  over and we talked to them calmly. We didn't really want anything but to be satisfied with our chosen meals.They countered-talked us... Which I always find offensive. Then the  Manager (who waited on me the last time)  felt compelled to say "" well you had a great experience last time right?"" well I never said anything to trigger that remark, but I agreed politely.  I especially found it too much when they tried to tell me that it wasn't even hair... LIKE I said I know hair!! Finally they offered us  to replace or food  with some other food and replace my food fresh, but we lost our appetite. I was so disgusted I didn't want to look at rice  or I would really toss my cookies( and I LOVEEEEEEE RICE) They gave us our money back for the meals. We paid for the sushi and left feeling rather violated. It was a truly unsatisfactory experience.BACK TO NICEI did go back way later, like 7 months later, and only ordered sushi because we were all going to a concert at Firestone and could confirm that the sushi is decent.  But I'm not inspired to return anytime soon. I will however go to the Dr. Phillips location! No need to explain the one star.I hope this story makes you aware to check your food and ALWAYS speak up when you are not satisfied.  I think if anyone is respectful a positive outcome may happen."
7/8/2014,3,"Went there this past weekend. Liked the food and the suishi was better than I've had at most places. Kind of waited a while to eat once I got there, but worth it, because the food was filling!I would def recommend!"
1/11/2013,4,"Bento is a frequent place I visit here in Orlando. I love coming here! I specifically enjoy the K roll, Crunch roll, Volcano roll, and dynamite roll. Out of all the sushi spots I've tried, I really enjoy their ginger salad the most. The miso soup is always good - never too salty. Over the past few months they've been featuring an all you can eat sushi on Saturday afternoons. Pretty good deal - soup/salad, as well as a selection of rolls to choose from (a decent selection too). It's impossible to get in here for lunch during the week, but otherwise, it's not usually hard to get a spot. And if you have to wait it's not for long usually. I've always had a pleasant experience with the servers and overall service at Bento. Love coming here!"
7/15/2015,3,I was down the street at the hospital and decided to meet a friend for lunch.  They have a good selection of rolls to choose from and various sets to try.  The prices were about what you would expect.  Overall I tried two rolls and it was not bad.
2/17/2011,3,"2 Stars for the Bento Box.Why? Saaaaaaaaaalt. Salty, saltish, salt-lick like. Salt.The Mongolian Beef Bento Box's main dish-the beef-was tasty. Not overly salty. Nice and sweet, tender beef. The plain white rice- also not salty. But...The ginger dressing for the mixed greens salad, the noodles, and the green beans were all kinds of sodium infused. And I LOVE salty/savory stuffs, but it was too much. 3 Stars for the Sweetheart Roll.Salmon and tuna top off a rice papered roll of tempura shrimp, cucumber, avocado,  and a not too spicy spice. Very tasty. Glad to have read Colleen's recent review that didn't make the sushi here sound scary. But....The pickled ginger which comes with all sushi was also a total freaking salt lick! And the tiny, overpriced egg rolls were ridiculous. In a bad way. So, next time, I'll just order more sushi!!P.S.When you go for lunch, you order at the counter, pay, seat yourself, get your own drinks. Dinner is more full service."
9/24/2016,4,"We are from OKC and we really really love their Chicken teriyaki & streak udon stir fried, ohhh and nice service also !!!"
1/24/2010,4,Inconsistent service but good food. Inexpensive option when you're downtown and looking for something more than fast food. Lots of vegetarian options but be careful and ask. Bento box noodles are made with chicken broth and Japanese curry / all soups are non-vegetarian.I love the Korean Spicy and Soy Chili tofu. Haven't tried sushi yet but they do have several vegetarian options...
1/21/2015,4,"Bento has become my new favorite place for Sushi in Orlando. I absolutely love the Special Mexican and Red Dragon Rolls. It's also a great place to take a Sushi hater, like my partner in crime, so they can order non-sushi grub. The service can be slow at times. If you park in the garage they only validate for 90 minutes. They usually offer a check-in deal to Yelpers."
1/13/2018,4,The ambience was nice. But you have to order your food at the counter and there are no servers so it takes away from the experience.
10/10/2009,3,The bento box meals are pretty good. the prices are cheap for downtown. Other than that it doesn't define itself very well in a city overflowing with great choices for asian food.
6/16/2018,1,"Over glorified chinese fast food. Rice is over cooked, chicken was dry, but swimming in over seasoned sauce, vegetables were soggy. I ate it 15 minutes ago and I already have bad belly grumbles. Not worth it. (Sesame chicken bento box )"
7/20/2010,2,"I have 3 good things to say about this place:              *They validate your parking              *The decor is pretty trendy and sleek              *It's right in the center of downtownAsian fusion has become a really trendy thing. I don't believe just because something is trendy, food quality should be sacrificed.  I can't really testify for the sushi because I'm not a sushi fan. I had sweet and sour chicken which was probably the worst I've had anywhere. It was chicken with sauce from a bottle. No vegetables or anything. To me the food quality doesn't match the location or decor. If you're looking for good, cheap Asian fusion try Pei Wei...a little further out of downtown but MUCH better food."
10/24/2010,2,"TER.RI.BLE. The only good thing they got going for them is the food.Went their last night to have dinner with some friends( 10 of us) in the downtown location because it was closer to the event we were attending. After we received menus and drinks it took our server ""Jaime"" a good 15 minutes to acknowledge us again. When I asked her who was taking our orders she had a slick, sarcastic response. I asked for Boba tea early on and they simply just stopped making them. I'd much rather drive 25 more minutes to the Dr. Phillips location were the service is 10x's more efficient and they STILL HAVE BOBA TEA. In the Dr. Phillips location I wont have to worry about snappy waitresses and bad service.The validation issue is also a pain in the butt and not worth the trouble."
3/16/2011,3,"I'm not gonna lie, I eat Bento often. They have good sushi and 9 times out of ten it's super fresh. My three things while eating sushi that are important to me are; freshness, tightly wrapped rolls, and good eel sauce. and they've got all of that.I recommend getting your sushi to go rather than staying in ; although, the place is pretty cool looking inside. I say this because out of the 30 times I've eaten there the service has been terrible. You'll sit around forever while waiting for anything at all, and the servers always forget something or just kind of ignore you. I'm not saying they aren't nice broads, they are, but they are forgetful- even on a slow day. I've been going there for a few years and out of that time I have had ONE good server. I might be a little critical, because I work as a server/ bartender, but that also means I'm very lenient and try to take in everything that is happening.Anyways, I'd eat there again- I probably will this week, but I'll call in y order and have it to go.They also have some noodle dishes that are decent, but I've had better. and the seaweed salad is good, prices are pretty good, and make their edamame correctly which is good, because somehow there are places that screw that up."
4/16/2015,5,Absolutely LOVE Bento at the Amway Center.  Honestly the BEST thing in the concessions.   I am thinking about buying season tickets for the Solar Bears next year and I would be DEVASTATED if you were no longer there.  PLEASE come back next season!!!!
12/20/2015,2,"So disappointed! This is usually a good place but lately their service has really suffered.  First,  we had to wait for a table though we saw tables available (they didn't appear to be reserved). Then I ordered the hamachi kama and instead of telling me that she didn't understand what it was, she rung up the wrong order. I had to wait for them to cook the right order while my party was eating their meal. When the bill came, they didn't comp me anything. And, in top of that, when I asked them to validate my parking, they didn't!  Not sure if I'll ever return now."
7/29/2014,5,"I love, love, love this place!My friends literally are so tired of hearing me ask them to come eat with me like 5 times a week here! I usually make it once a week and I am always trying new things, I have yet to be disappointed."
8/16/2010,4,"After several visitations to the Bento red cafe in Dr. Phillips I decided to try Bento blue cafe in downtown a try. The service is alot more upbeat in this location so an additional star gets granted for the quick witted service.The bento boxes are just as yummy and price reasonable as the other location. The stir fry noodles balance out the plain set rice with the seasoned veggies. Their boba tea is mighty creamy, not over the top sweetened just right. They just put a tab bit more tapioca pearls here than any other boba place I tried. I am delighted this place closes at 10:30 p.m it's perfect for the 9 pm boba set cravings that no other place in Orlando can serve. Overall cheap, hip, and a delightful place to bring in friends. Cool blue dragon bento is my preferrable bento choice.Even thought the veggy spring rolls are as skinny as my fingers..I still kinda like you guys lol."
8/11/2009,3,"I think I've finally cracked the Bento code. The key here is to go for lunch, when the cafe only offers counter service. The menu is the same, the prices are the same, but you don't have to wait 15 minutes for the server to refill your drink because you refill it yourself! On my first visit, I got the garlic chicken Bento box. Skip the boxes ... they are really big, and while you get plenty of food, only about half of the sides are any good (and the little puff pastry is downright awful.) The garlic chicken itself tasted quite good, but the chicken had that strange, inexpensive Asian white meat texture. I would recommend instead any of the dishes as a rice bowl or noodle bowl. Even though you don't get any sides, they are plenty of food and you won't walk away hungry. Thumbs up on the flavor of the Cajun chicken rice bowl (although, again, the texture was slightly weird). There was also a good-sized pile of green beans in the bowl, so the dish didn't feel too starchy with all of the rice. If Bento offered brown rice, this would be the perfect lunchtime dish. I've heard very mixed things about the sushi, both from people I've dined with and friends who have gone separately. Most comments hang out in the ""okay but not a standout"" neighborhood. The boba teas are a real treat ... give them a go if you want something a little different. Overall, Bento is a solid three stars. If they can speed up their evening service, I think they will have found a comfortable niche in the downtown dining scene."
9/2/2015,5,I have been to Bento handful times. Its a great fast food lunch dine in. Their noodle bowls are amazing. My favorite is SOY CHILI CHICKEN NOODLE BOWL
5/12/2016,5,"It was our first time and although the experience started off ruff, there was a group that had too much to drink and being loud. Our waitress Courtney saw my husband and I were getting a little annoyed and moved us to another table. We ordered my food came out wrong so I had to send it back. Courtney came over and was so sweet and apologetic about everything my food came right out and it was great. She checked on us the rest of the night she asked us to come back and give them another try and said she was truly sorry our first time was a little rock. We are definitely going back the food is great and Courtney was awesome."
2/12/2016,4,"This place is awesome especially at happy hour. The entrees are all really good, and the atmosphere is ultra casual. Simply tasty Asian food. And the prices aren't ridiculous for what you're getting. If you want fancy, stay clear. But if you like really good Asian food in a casual environment, Bento is worth a visit. :)"
5/20/2013,4,"I got the Bento box which was a good amount of food. I always get the Pad Thai, that is just my favorite, just the right amount of heat every time. I got an appetizer for checking in which I shared with the table. So with the app and the box I was happily full.They pack a lot of tables in a small place but it doesn't feel cramped. I went with three other people and could hear them just fine. I also like the location there are places to go after dinner and you don't have to move the car."
11/29/2015,5,"Bento is one of my all time favorites, the food is always great. The spicy cream chicken is hands down the best thing I have ever had. The sushi is always great. I never have a problem when eating here, the service is awesome. Overall a great place for quick service."
7/24/2011,3,Sushi = HEAVEN! This is always our go to spot when we are craving sushi (which is almost daily) the busy atmosphere sometimes makes it difficult to find a table if you have 3 or more in your party.  I would NOT recommend going during the lunch time hours because you have to serve yourself which is not fun at all.
2/1/2016,5,"Had the katsu spicy curried chicken and noodle bowl.  Perfect portion and flavor for lunch.  Service was quick and accurate.   If you like something with a little bite, this hits the spot."
6/8/2009,3,"We grabbed a quick bite at Bento before heading upstairs for a movie at the new Plaza Cinema.  Service was adequate - attentive, but not intrusive.  Food was okay.  My sushi was good - and I got a great deal with the sushi combo box - you pick two rolls (4 pieces each) + 4 California rolls = 12 pieces for $8.25.  My sushi was fine - tasty and fresh, but, not remarkable.  My husband didn't care for his garlic tofu - they use silken tofu, which can be, uh, slimy in texture, and he thought his dish was rather bland.  We were both thrown off by the decor, however.  At a glance it looks very upscale.  But, disposable plastic cups for water, and plastic ""china"" didn't seem to fit.  My husband's rice bowl did come in a china bowl.  Why not go all china?  Also, the giant windows hadn't been cleaned in a while, and the window ledges needed dusting.  Our glass table showed it's wear badly due to under-lighting, which cast a weird glow on our food.  Also, why not hide the service station with a curtain or something?I don't regret our visit, but, with all the other great Asian places in Orlando, we probably won't be back."
1/30/2016,5,Great service and really delicious food! Thank you Enrique for making our first time at Bento an enjoyable one. We will definitely becoming back for sure.
9/26/2013,5,"My favorite place to go for healthy sushi. For me, that means I order Neo Tokyo Kawaii (wrapped in lettuce and rice paper). Tuna, krab delite, avocado, drizzled with sweet chili sauce. Super yummy. I get my sushi fix without the rice carbs."
2/10/2017,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. We came in and waited for a table at 8:17pm. As time passed, we noticed that people who came in long after us were seated before us. We asked the hostess how long until we're seated and he first quoted 15 mins. We waited the 15 mins then asked again and he said 10-15 so all in all it was roughly 45 mins. Once we were seated our party ordered our food immediately after being seated because we didn't want to wait longer. We waited over 25 mins for our food and it was still not ready! We asked the waitress how much longer and she said it's coming out shortly but that became another 10 mins and still no food. At this point we asked to speak to a manager but was told there was no manager on duty... the gentlemen that we spoke to said they were waiting for the sushi bento box we ordered and that was the reason our food took so long... I could've learned how to make my own sushi with the time it took to wait for a table and wait for our food; just saying. The amount of time spent at this place was not worthy the wait. Ultimately we left before our food arrived. We should've stuck to our initial plan, which was dining at Wahlburger. This place is a typical franchised restaurant and should be avoided at all cost. This was my family's first and last time ever coming to this place. The staff here are not attentive to large parties as it seems this place is too small to host them in a timely manner."
9/8/2010,3,"Good things:-They validate your parking-The food is great.-The food is priced pretty fair.Bad things:-inconsistent service.I go here quite a lot, so I've seen different waitress/waiters and the service has always been inconsistent. What I mean is that they will forget something that I ask for (eel sauce) or take too long to fill up my drink. Some times, I wait a while to get my check. Other than that, this is my PREFERRED place to eat sushi. It's just far from my house."
2/3/2012,5,"This place is great. I have been to a few sushi places around Orlando, but this one is the greatest experience I've had. The ambience, the decor, and the waiting staff all make you feel welcome. It's a very modern-styled place. Unlike some sushi places the menus are way easier to understand.The food was magnificent, and the prices were reasonable. I can find cheaper sushi, sure, but I could find much more expensive sushi at a far less enjoyable place.Highly recommend it."
1/17/2016,5,"When we can't get to PF Chang's, we want good Chinese food and call for Bentos - which is also a lil quicker and cheaper."
4/7/2016,5,Getting a spicy tuna don or specialty sushi roll is the highlight of cuisine at the Solar Bears games in the Amway Center. The food is expertly crafted and always tastes amazing. Can't wait to see you back next season!
6/14/2009,3,"Bento Cafe offers a wide variety of Asian cuisine at reasonable price.  There were six of us in the party and the bill came out to be less than $60.  We tried different noodle soup bowls and bentos.  My favorite was the Japanese pork chop bento (Katsu).   Overall, the bentos are very satisfying.  Nothing to wow us, but a good place for reasonable priced meals."
6/1/2018,4,"The steak is amazing, would get the steak again... but the noodles on the other hand are WAY too spicy and I don't think I would get their noodles in a close future. I love Bento café but I do not love their spicy noodles."
7/29/2008,3,"I will be honest, I have not jumped on the train of people who enjoy eating sushi.  So I cannot offer my true opinion of the sushi offered at Bento.  I can report though that a host of my Orlando friends cannot get enough!  Located in the Solaire on Orange Ave. it's a great location for urban dwellers craving asian cuisine.The variety seems to be up to par along with healthy substitutions such as brown rice.  I can say that the rice or noodle bowls arrive at the table promptly and generally get eaten with the same speed.  Again, I personally cannot say I've tried these, but I have been told to try: the Red Dragon Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Flying Dragon Roll.  The price is right for the large amount served."
8/19/2015,4,Great atmosphere. The sushi is always on point and service is quick. All rolls are price well. We always get 3 rolls 3 side salad and an appetizer and spend about $40 -$45
12/16/2015,5,The food was really good. My favorite appetizer on their list was Crab cheese rangoon. Its like a perfect portion of cheese and the imitation crab meat.
5/31/2013,4,"What I like the most about this place is that it's open late and there are always a lot of people there.I've only had the sushi and apps here. I love getting the sushi with the mango in it or kiwi in it. As far as quality goes, the sushi is exactly what you want, not bad but not amazingly good. Overall if I could, I would give it a 3.5 rating. Since I go there so much I decided to bump it up to a 4 star!"
2/21/2016,3,Super overpriced for mediocre food. I honestly only come here when I'm at the Cobb theater downtown and forgot to eat before leaving the house. The only thing I really like here is their wontons.
11/25/2015,4,This place is great for sushi and noodle bowls. Would recommend it to anyone downtown and looking for a fast casual place for Asian/Sushi.
2/19/2018,3,"Not the most professional place, customer service is subpar, however the food is good for the price. Wouldn't come back a second time, but it's good for a quick bite."
9/30/2011,4,"Currently, I'm on a very low carb diet, and decided that sashimi was the best way to go when coming to a japanese place. I chose the Tuna Lovers Special. I've only eaten raw regular tuna, but the other 2 two choices that came with it definitely opened my palette! The white tuna, I believe is escolar, just melts in your mouth like butter!Also their spicy and garlic edamame is a great appetizer to start with."
6/16/2012,4,"A solid choice for sushi and bento boxes.  Located in a prime location downtown right off Orange Ave.  Prices are reasonable, noodle bowls are filling and the food is delicious.  Trendy interior decoration and friendly service."
7/30/2011,3,Oh Bento how you get it so wrong yet you are so good.The Service is always slow as molasses here. Sometimes it takes 1.5 hours just to have a 1 course meal. Drinks come whenever you hit the lottery numbers.The place is LOUD - there is no acoustic treatment at all.. so its like stuffing 100 ppl in your garage. You can barely hear a conversation from someone right across the table from you.But Bento has awesome specials and its a great deal. So I go back time and time again. Just make sure you have enough time to eat :)
2/21/2011,4,"I've had take out from here and I've dined in.  Both times, the sushi was fresh and delicious.  The best value on the menu is the 151 Roll.  It has an entire tempura fried lobster tail on top of it.  For $15.95, you can't beat it.  Red Lobster won't even serve you a lobster tail for that price.  The special Mexican roll also totally rocks.  We also had a Gucci roll, which was divine.  The spicy edamame are perfect; just spicy enough to satisfy, but not so spicy that it blows out your taste buds.  I've had better sushi elsewhere, but for the location and value, it's worth a trip."
11/8/2015,2,"Apparently the service I had here was minimal. Which I have never had before. I was asked it my water wanted refilled? Um it's empty right?  Obviously I want this refilled. Then. My boyfriend and I ordered 6 rolls separately. They all came out on the same tray, and I had to ask the food runner which roll was which. When I said something to the server, he seemed like he didn't care and non-shalantly asked if we wanted a refill of our waters (which had been empty for 10 minutes). I am extremely disappointed in our service. When I put my Tuna Udon bowl to the side, a server asked if that person had finished eating. (I'm sorry are you handicapped?? Obviously it was my bf and I only eating, no there was not a third person. And yes. I did push my plate to the side). I am EXTREMELY disapponted in Bento. We have been here frequently and recently and I hope things improve."
4/11/2009,1,"To be truly honest, giving Bento Cafe at least 1 star would be considered a fairly nice compliment to the sham of a restaurant it really is. I've tried a range of wonderfully decadent restaurants and this was FAR from it. At best, this place deserves a -3 star (if possible).I cannot come up with any logical reason as to why Bento Cafe currently has a rating of 4 stars. My conclusion would be that there are several one-sided reviews from management on here.We went to Bento Cafe on a Thursday night around 8:20PM. Me and my boyfriend had never tried Bento Cafe, so we thought we'd give it a try. Much later did i think that it was a fairly BAD IDEA. To begin with, our annoyingly, bubbly waitress greeted us and sat us at a grimy, sticky table. This usually happens when:A. They reuse the table washcloth over-and-over.B. They DON'T wash/rinse the table washcloth after cleaning a table.C. Both A & B.You see, cleanliness is not a factor for Bento Cafe.Nevertheless, we tried wiping up the grime with the napkins at our table. I briefly ordered a Thai tea, while my boyfriend ordered a Boba tea. Many seats were empty and there were a equivalent of 3 couples including us. A slow night we had thought. Perhaps we'd get our orders out faster and we'd get out quicker; away from that grimy table sticking to our elbows.In a couple of minutes, the waitress came out with our overwhelming distasteful, powdery teas. She told us she'd give us a FEW MINUTES to decide what we wanted for the main course. But it took her about 10 minutes for her to realize we were still waiting for her to take our orders.She FINALLY took our orders:A Shrimp Tempura Bento Box ($8.75) for me.A Volcano Roll ($8.95) for the boyfriend.What happens after this is unbelievable. We sat there and waited. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited some more until I told my BF to turn on the timer on his phone. I figured since we've been waiting for A WHILE, the food would be cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients. Right....? RIGHT? We had this conversation while we were waiting indefinitely.WRONG. The schmuck finally served us after waiting for 30 minutes.When the ""food"" came out (if you could even call it edible), it was COLD. Stale as if they had left it on the back counter for a few years, or something that was scraped up from behind the kitchen stove. The ""shrimp tempura"" was soft and soggy and the cold oily noodles didn't taste too good either (imagine licking dry wall....). The side beans were extremely oily and the rice was too dry. I couldn't bear myself to stomach the sad-looking piece of ""dessert"" they slapped on the side. I started feeling nauseous midway into the ""Shrimp Tempura"". I stared at the grease that was congealing before my eyes and immediately pushed the sad excuse of a bento box away.When the bill finally came, we were both immensely tired and exhausted with a loss of appetite. We literally wasted over an hour at this place, waiting for the garbage you pass off as quality bento boxes / sushi.NEVER, NEVER AGAIN.Bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere. Highly not recommended."
4/17/2015,4,One of my favorite Sushi restaurants.  My number one is their location in Dr Phillips.  I would give them 5 stars but making the customer pay extra for Sriracha is ridiculous when your other locations have bottles of it on the tables for free.  I don't like being nickle and dimed for condiments.  Other than that very good.
3/19/2015,3,"If you're really in the mood for Japanese food, and can't be bothered to walk a few blocks away from the Plaza, then Bento fits the bill. The cuisine won't win any awards, but it gets the job done. Service is OK, if a little lackluster on the busy weekends."
3/23/2016,5,"My boyfriend and I have come to this bento several times and have always gotten terrible service but since we love the food we still go back. Last night however our service was amazing! Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgable. I believe his name was Enrique, he was super polite and helpful it was the best experience we've had at bento!"
8/6/2015,2,"We use to eat here once a week minimum. But the last three times , the service has been just awful . The wait staff is in need of a total overhaul . They are just plain rude and bad at their jobs . No one seems to care or want to take care of any problems ie.... Order totally wrong food brought out one plate at a time over a 30 min period for a table of four . This was the third week In a row and it was just an awful experience. Sushi rolls falling apart , portions cut so thin , half of what a normal portion has always been. It really is upsetting to go to a place for years , and to see them decline at such a fast pace. Keep wishing it was just a bad night , but after this last meal we have just decided to find another  fav sushi place in Orlando :(FYI , trying to reach you , tammy@bento-group.comUnable to find a valid email address. You can reach me at lgraycst@hotmial.com ."
8/24/2014,5,"I like the fact that Bento is a small restaurant. And centered in my neighborhood of downtown Orlando it makes it easy and convenient. The food is really good. I like the different types of rolls, not the same ol same ol. The soups are great too. I have ordered it delivered at times and have not been disappointed by inconsistencies either."
9/4/2014,5,SERIOUSLY GOOD! I lived in Orlando for a couple years and fell in love with this place. Every time I go back I have to eat here. Ive been to one in Gainesville & the Dr phillips location(which I prefer because of the boba/bubble tea). I would love to see them open one down here in southwest Florida. Its known for the sushi but I highly recommend The Spicy Cream chicken. Its to die for. I literally crave it! Can't wait to go again
3/22/2015,4,"Found this place thanks to yelp. The reviews were convincing and i must say they were not exaggerated.  Nice ambiance, friendly staff,  food is made fresh and the presentation is amazing.  I had the the tofu pad thai for lunch... i have to say Compliments to the chief,  I've gone to many Japanese/thai restaurants before and for some they over cook the tofu,  but here... it was cooked to perfection, not too hard or too chewy... maybe it was my lucky day, but food enough to make me want to come back.  The prices aren't too bad either.  The Jade abs mango roll is awesome , so many selections to choose from something must hit your desired craving."
3/14/2015,1,Worst sushi I've ever had. Visiting from out of town. .really wanted sushi and found this place
12/17/2017,1,"I've been here once before and the service was great, this time only the lady who took my ordered was extremely nice and understand and the people who brought the food were rude and acted like I was just taking up there time like they had something better to do as I watched them sit there and talk and do nothing. Unimpressed."
7/12/2015,5,This is one of my favorite places to eat in Orlando. Great food! Service is not always the best but the food is good.
6/16/2010,4,"Looks like your typical ""trendy"" sushi joint, but the crowd & pricing doesn't reflect the space.I went for the sashimi platter for the main course. It was $22 for 27 generous pieces of sashimi, including salmon, tuna, tai, yellowtail, escolar, ikura, & a clam of some sort.  Pretty standard, but good, fresh quality.  They also have bubble tea so I gave that a try as well.They've got a huge selection of rolls, many of them cooked, so if you're  a sushi noob, or sushi-timid, you should feel safe here; I wouldn't call this place an ""authentic"" sushi restaurant.  Happy Hour:  Buy 2 rolls, get 1 free.  Something else too but can't remember what.  If you're a sushi-tsu, you won't be happy here.  If you're just in the mood for quality standard sushi or a bunch of rolls(they have ~45 rolls) then stop in."
8/27/2010,3,"Price, taste, service and atmosphere - All Good. I visit there weekly for lunch since I work downtown. Always fast and always, corteous and clean. The Bento Box or the Noodle Bowls are the way to go, a little bit of everything for a great price. Recommend the Udan Noodle Bowl and if you cant make it out they deliver through doorstopdelivery.com :)"
2/2/2017,4,"They must got some improvement over the years or it just this location?  Been to bento on sand lake years back and found it to be okay.  Not the place I will pick for sushi.  But tonight they seem to earned my approval.   Got to revisited the place thanks to my friends Mike today.  Ordered a chirashi which usually what I get when going to a sushi restaurant.  Different type of sashimi on top of sushi rice.  Lack of presentation and knife work compared to my favorite spot but it's half the price.  $11!!!!  Omg.  That's the best deal I found so far.   The sashimi is fresh.  Thankfully.  Sushi rice little on the low side.  The texture and tastes are a bit off. But I totally won't mind for the price.  Although not sure why I didnt get any wasabi with it or ginger.  I need to asked for that.  Which I found to be odds.  That's like the common things to be given for sashimi.   I will understand if it's a nigiri.  Traditionally, it should be paired with right amount of wasabi already inside and you just choose to dip with soy sauce.  Anyway, it's totally a great night.  Awesome food.  I love to visit again.  If I ever in the area and in mood for sushi. That's the place I will go !  Totally coming back on a good night. Grab some sake and sushi.  Sit back and enjoy my night.  Awesome.  If you down there for whatever reason.  Give it a shot.  Even if you never ate sushi before.  My friend Mike tried it and he totally love it now.   Good job buddy.   So yep.  Grab your date.  Go watch a movie. Eat some great sushi."
10/24/2010,4,"Sashimi bowl with rice for $10.  That should be all you need to know, but the menu is huge, and some of the other servings that came to my table were also well-endowed.  That includes the chicken noodle soup, which is on my list to try if the weather here ever drops below 55 (that's when we turn the heat on back up north).Someone else got some sort of lo-mein style udon noodle stirfry, which I'm also looking forward to burying my face in.The best part is that you can bop next door for frozen yogurt at Mochi when you are done.... and I came back for the udon stir-fry, and it was glorious.  The bad news?  No more bubble tea.  The good news?  Bubble tea is moving in next door at Mochi - yay!"
9/7/2015,4,I got a ton of sushi and the beef noodles with veggies to go for my boyfriend and I for the first time the other day and it was so so much food and really good!!! I went a little overboard and ordered too much but I was surprised with how fresh things were. I'll def be back!
3/18/2011,4,"Creamy Spicy Chicken Bento Box - Cheap and delicious!  Def the way to go.  The bowls have too much rice or noodles, so the bento box is a great mix.Nigiri - Salmon was super fresh and deliciousThey validate parking for 2 hrs! Otherwise be prepare to pay $10 to use the parking structure."
4/2/2012,3,"As I see some reviewers have already touched base on (one referring to it at the ""Olive Garden"" of sushi restaurants, which I consider accurate), I wouldn't necessarily label this an authentic sushi restaurant, though it faired pretty well in my eyes. During a recent mini-vacation to Orlando, I couldn't overcome my regularly consistent sushi urges and had to stop in and try some.As always, I was ready to EAT! And luckily for me, they have a by two rolls, get one roll free as a regular special (high five for that!). The rolls were large, being 8 pieces per roll. If your math is accurate, then yes, I had 24 pieces of sushi. With the special price, it only turned out to be around $14, a pretty nice steal if you ask me.I order the Yoshi Roll, the Spicy Roll, and the Birthday Roll. I didn't keep track of the ingredients but I believe they have an online menu for all you foodies who want thorough descriptions.All of it was very good, the ingredients were fresh, and I definitely left full, very satisfying.My main complaint, and the reason for three stars, was the service. The friends I was staying with in Orlando had warned me that the service was sub-par and that it would take forever to even be seated. They were right. It took nearly a half hour for someone to come over and ask if we had been helped yet. I normally don't complain too much about service but it was inexcusable, especially considering the place was pretty empty. There were only about two other tables out of the entire restaurant that were occupied.But, given the nice location, good food, and great prices, I'd reccomend it for the local Orlando residents to get a quick sushi fix."
6/16/2015,4,"This place has a unique tasty flare on its sushi. Some less traditional and really creative combinations. There is a lot to pick from. I'm not into cheese or smoked choices in sushi so that kind of cut down on some selections. However, there was still plenty to pick from. The place was roomy, clean and a good atmosphere to sit down for lunch. The rolls were really fresh. The traditional roll I had was smooth and the TNT was full of flavor. The food here was really good. The staff was also very friendly and attentive."
1/2/2012,4,"Even though I wouldn't call this place an authentic Sushi/Bento restaurant, it's a great place to get your Sushi fix. There's a key things about Bento's Cafe that makes it a keeper in my book. 1.It's college friendly with the pricing. You can be satisfied with your meal without worrying about the bill. 2. Hipster environment. No worrying about being too loud or causing weird distractions here. Be yourself, nobody is judging you! 3. Good food. My favorite rolls here are the Mexican Rolls and the Mt.Fuji roll. Like I said before, I wouldn't consider this place an authentic Japanese Sushi bar, but it's a good place to get your sushi crave fix! I always order the Watakame Seaweed salad with the Sushi combo platter. (4 pieces of your own choice of roll + 4 pieces of your own choice roll+ 4 cali pieces roll.) I put the seaweed salad on top of the sushi and gobble it up! (: It's so yummy!!! I've never ordered a bento box here because I had bad experiences with them in the past...(Er..cake in a bento box?) But that was back in 2009..so maybe they've upgraded. However, I'll stick with my Sushi Roll ways and be a happy fish eater."
1/10/2015,4,Great food. Busy on a Saturday night. Everything was fresh. Will definitely come back
4/14/2015,3,Cheap sushi. .decent quality. DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY...they always mess up my orders. Have to always call and get them to refund me or resend an item.
10/4/2008,4,"Bento is located in the Solaire, one of the many newly constructed high rise condos in downtown Orlando.  I was pretty impressed upon entering Bento Cafe, as it was a very clean, upscale environment, the kind that you don't find too often in Orlando (there is even a TV in the bathroom!).  They offer great happy hour prices and extensive sushi choices.  They also offer Bento boxes, which come with a variety of items of your choice at a great price.  The last time I went was around 5pm on a Wednesday and we were the only ones there.  It is usually busier on the weekends and later during the week.  For great sushi at a great price, head over to Bento cafe."
1/23/2015,3,"Met some friends here while on a trip back home for the holidays. Its in the heart of downtown orlando. Great location if you work or live downtown.   I had the chicken bento box.. chicken, salad and noodles were all good and made for a satisfying lunch.  the downside was parking.. i parked in the lot upstairs and got validated but showed up a few minutes after the validation period and ended up paying $10 to park. i live in LA and never pay that much to park for lunch."
2/19/2015,5,"Awesome service, good food. Location is close to the Amway center. Who knew Japanese food in Florida could come close to Hawaii standards."
8/1/2015,5,"Absolutely great food, very affordable prices and Leanna is a fantastic server. A few reasons why I frequent here so often"
5/11/2009,3,"Drive by and decided to drop in since we were starved from the ride up. I had a bulgogi beef bowl with noddles. I dug it, we also tried the spicy dumplings, edemame, and fried dumplings. All were up to par. A great place for quick fast Asian food. I will try and swing by on my way out of town."
10/26/2015,5,My wife and I love this place. We got the bento boxes and it was delicious. The staff are awesome and the food came out quickly. I highly  recommend the Plum tea. It's a sweeter tea and is really good. The prices there are very reasonable. It was right around $20 for my wife and I.
9/14/2010,5,"Bento is a place that is very simple, don't expect exceptional service as if you were at a nice restaurant. The sushi is absolutely delicious, specially at this location.Everytime I am in Orlando I stop by here, its one of the best sushi I have tried. Fresh, yummy, and amazing!!"
3/23/2011,2,"I wish I could add another 1/2 a star, because it's better than 2 stars, but not quite 3.  First strike, the Dr. Phillips location stopped honoring restaurant.com gift certificates.  I had 3 waiting to be used and I'm pissed about it.  Sushi is good, not anything special, but it is fresh and good.  I enjoy the bento boxes.  I also enjoy the seared tuna salad they serve.  Hot and sour soup is exactly what you expect - all the right flavors, but nothing memorable.  Appetizers need a little creativity and brightness to them. I go back because it's consistent and convenient.  Not because I'm drawn back time and again.  GET RID OF THE GOLD PEAK ICED TEA.... BREWING TEA IS NOT DIFFICULT.  Add tea leaves to a filter and push a button."
6/23/2012,4,I went at a time when it wasn't so busy. Went with a friend and got the spicy cream chicken which I usually always get.     I really like how the interior of this bentos compared to the one in Gainesville and would recommend anyone to try it out. Definitely either try the spicy cream chicken or the katsu curry chicken. I also like to get the surf'n turf.
10/27/2012,3,"The place is cool. Nothing special. Service is pretty good and the food is decent. The downtown location is definitely much better than the one on Sandlake, servers are much more attentive and it doesn't feel like you are being rushed. Awesome boba teas, so that's definitely a win. Would certainly return!"
9/22/2015,4,Had the sriracha garlic chicken and lychee sake. Delicious!!!! Our service was not the best but the food is worth it
11/14/2014,3,"With the convenient location in downtown Orlando, I visited this restaurant for lunch on Thursday while I was waiting for my friend.  Even during the lunch time, the restaurant was not too crowded and my food was served in timely manner.  However, I was disappointed with the amount of food compared to other bento cafes throughout FL. I ordered spicy tuna rice bowl with extra tuna and avocado. It looked like they gave regular bowl and really not much avocado. The bento cafe on sand lake gives a lot more meat than this one. So I was pretty disappointed with its small portion although I paid extra $2.50 for extra meat. :("
4/9/2015,5,Crab Rangoon as appetizer and spicy cream chicken bento box will not disappoint. If you like sweet and spicy those are the choices for you. And food comes out pretty fast too. Love coming here when we get a chance to get away from the little one and watch a movie at nearby Cobb theatre.
2/7/2015,5,Amazing Pan Asian food. Lots of selections and the service is great. Grsar for those that want to quickly grab something to eat but in the mood for Asian. I don't eat Sushi but my friends keep praising their Sushi.
5/16/2015,3,"Great for a quick bite of Asian cuisine, without a polystyrene box or high end chopsticks. Price is a little high for what it is and service is okay. A good place for a quick, yet Asian diner feel while you're downtown before your movie."
10/19/2015,3,"I always come here for sushi, I've never really had anything else on their menu. They have a sushi box that comes with a California roll, two rolls of your choice, seaweed salad, and cucumber. I work nearby so I'll stop here for lunch and always do the sushi box. I always get my food quickly and the staff is nice. Haven't had a problem with them"
10/6/2014,5,"Greatest sushi around! From the rolls to the rice bowls, and everything in between, Bento always offers the best. My favorite sushi rolls are the Mt Fiji and the Mexican. My mouth waters just thinking about it! Easy to give these guys 5 stars! Sandlake location even has boba tea! Check in for a free appetizer :)"
6/24/2014,2,"They couldn't manage to get my order right.  Fried rice was made wrong and sushi was never entered into their ordering system.  All in all, this place makes money because of its location. Not because the food or service is great."
12/18/2016,1,"Horrible. Worst service ever. So as soon as I walked in the air conditioning wasn't working so it was humid as hell in there. The server (I can't remember her name) forgets to put my appetizer in. (It wasn't even busy). Then I ask her for albacore but she doesn't know what that is. I advise her it's a fish. I would assume it's a sushi place she should know what it is. She says we don't have that. So I out in my roll order. Very simple order, a roll in the menu just substituted the tuna did spicy tuna. She said I have to charge you and extra dollar. I say ok. Simple right? Nope. She brings it out with a slice of tuna in it. I open it for her and show her that the Order is wrong. She agrees and takes it back. Only to bring it back out to me and tell me the guy said it has both. I shake my head and say, please look at this. I open several pieces and show her, where do you see spicy tuna, there's nothing but a cut slice of tuna in every piece. I show her and she rolls her eye and walked away behind the counter, sets it down and tell the sushi guy something and then walks to the back? First of all bad service, and now an attitude. Great. Next thing you know the manager comes out and I explain what happened only to look behind him and see the 2 sushi guys staring straight at me like I'm the one who fucked up the order. Own your mistake. Make it right. That's all we ask. Needless to say I asked the manager to forget my order and cash me out for my soda. The manager apologized for the mistake and said he would take care of it. Very disappointed. But that server needs to seem real training on listening and quality customer service. Will never be back."
7/20/2015,5,"Having lived in Orlando for five years I am mildly obsessed with Bento. The sushi is always fresh and the rolls are imaginative with great flavor combinations. My favorites: TNT, Mt. Fuji, Caliente, and Special Mexican. The TNT and Caliente have the perfect amount of spice and the sweetness of the Mt. Fuji is a great counterbalance. Over the years I have brought numerous people here that have lived in NYC, San Francisco and Los Angeles and they have all been impressed with the sushi. The atmosphere of the downtown restaurant is nice. It's a great place to hit up before a night out. You also can't beat half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays and their buy 2-get 1 roll at happy hour. For me, the saddest part of no longer living in Orlando is not being able to get Bento!!"
4/21/2015,5,Raul makes the best spicy tuna don bowl in the whole joint. Love having you guys here at the Amway Center.
9/17/2015,3,"Today got bento box and noodles dry and terrible waiter not helpful or clued in when customer says ""dry, heat lamp"" it means get fresh ones... Their soup is good, but this was very disappointing - worse than mall food quality :("
10/29/2013,3,"Went here with friends, had been here once or twice before. Our first choice was Ceviche (closed Monday) or Ichiban (which changed names and is now no longer - sad). My experience here is it's quick service and typically busy- in and out like a cafe. I had the sushi box deal where you get the Cali roll and two others of your choice. The special Mexican roll was yum- served in a Bento box w/ a cucumber salad (didn't love) and string beans (cold) with sesame (did like this) also had ginger salad on side cause I'm a freak for that dressing. My friends all had bentos- two with chicken variations and one with Don Salmon. We all agreed its a good value dining there. Beer selection? Typical of an Asian/ Thai restaurant ( nothing craft or micro ). Bathrooms were gross and as we were sitting at table I noticed food stains on the wall. Service was attentive and suggested when asked. Overall, for a quick bite try this place- looking to impress? I'd move on."
1/23/2015,2,"This is different from those in Gainesville. In Gainesville, they take the order from the cash register and they deliver the order to the seat and they don't take a tip. Here it is like a regular restaurant.  Last night I ordered Chirashi bur the waitress didn't bring the small dish for the soy sauce. Wasabi didn't come with Chirashi. They don't know what to do. I ordered the extra meat for $2.50 but they added only 1 piece of grilled eel."
6/21/2015,1,Horrible service. For last 3 times I have been here service was worse than before. Dining room is empty and hostess is mia. After being seated table is filthy dirty and Sri my. I asked to be. Leaned.  It never happened. I had to change tables on my own. I asked for my order to have side of siracha and specifically mentioned to waitress to make sure I et nude side since I never got the last few times I visited. And of course they still did not bring and I had to ask several times to make it happen. Will never be back here or recommend to anyone.
8/20/2015,5,There spicy creamy chicken is to die for. I have it at least 3 or 4 times a month snd there all you can eat sushi special is bomb.
5/2/2014,4,Yummy sushi and great service. We love sitting at the bar because the sushi chefs are so nice.
2/25/2017,3,"We UberEATS to go.  I had the TNT roll sadly,  if you can slice the Tuna any thinner it would vanish.  Quite possibly they were running out?  The miso was a hit as well as the Tuna salad. Not sure I would order the roll again, being a sushi snob."
12/13/2014,4,"Good quality at a very fair price.  This is a go-to for lunch downtown.  The bento boxes are great, the portions on the dons are a little small but very tasty."
8/7/2014,5,A quality asian meal at an affordable price of about 8 dollars an entree. There are many choices of flavors to choose from so you're bound to find something to suit your taste.
6/17/2014,5,"This is my favorite sushi spot in Orlando - the prices are great, the food is consistently good, both sushi and bento boxes, the staff is always friendly and despite it being downtown, I've never had to wait too long to be seated.  Definitely worth a trip if you're downtown Orlando and craving some sushi."
8/4/2014,3,"I came here about two weeks ago. I was in the downtown area and was looking for something eat. I went on my yelp app on y phone and saw this place was very close to where I was. It was actually in the area I parked. However, I could not find Bento at first. I walked by it a couple times before I realized. I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a fast casual type of place. You order your food at the counter, and then they bring the food to your table. I ordered the sushi combo box lunch special with included two rolls of your chorice, and a california roll for $9.25. It seems like a good deal, but each roll is only four pieces. I'm used to rolls being  , on average, 6 pieces each. So, I thought that was a little odd. I ordered the jalapeno and the spicy tuna rolls to accompany the california roll. All the rolls were okay, but nothing above average. The jalapeno roll did have a pretty nice kick to it. Overall I had a good experience and would recommend."
8/23/2014,4,"The food here is great for the price. It's not cheap, but it's high quality and you get a lot. Most of their dishes are excellent. Their sushi is good and also more reasonably priced than other sushi places around the Orlando area. I highly recommend Bento to anyone craving asian cuisine."
2/1/2015,5,I haven't tried anything here I didn't like! The Special Mexican roll and Mongolian Chicken Noodle Bowl are by far my favorites!
4/22/2017,3,"The food is ok, but used to be better here. The service is getting a lot worse.  Servers are not trained well. Miso soup was served almost cold, no small dishes for soy sauce, servers ask question how food is and walk away before we can answer. The sushi is ok, but the service has gotten too frustrating."
5/31/2013,4,"My girlfriend and I go here at least once a month. It's a great place to meet friends before going out to bars and clubs downtown.Honestly, for us, it's more about the atmosphere and location than the food. While some of their dishes are higher in quality, other dishes just don't measure up. The fish is always fresh and tasty, while the rice is consistently sticky, and the portions of rice are rather large.Anything sashimi on the menu is very good. If you do prefer a good amount of rice, their ""Tuna-Don"" bowls are especially good. Make sure you get their spicy Japanese Mayo too!!! Very good!We will continue to go to Bento Cafe simply on the principle of atmosphere and location. There are better Sushi establishments in Orlando, and even in Downtown. If you're looking for a great place for a party, or large group, Bento is the place. The food is just good enough. Oh, I forgot to mention the prices are very fair for the location.Stop by Bento is you're ever in Downtown and want some quality Sushi at a good price and fairly quick."
5/5/2017,2,"I visited Bento for the first time in about 6 months last night, and was very disappointed. It has gone from full service dining to basically fast food restaurant-like service. No one acknowledges you when you walk in the door, which was confusing because I was used to being seated by a host and having a server come to the table. Now, you order from the front counter, take a number, and choose your own table. No one comes to check on you, they only bring you your food. I'm not quite certain what I'm expected to tip on if there's no actual service. I would normally have a few drinks with my dinner, but now that means that I have to get up, grab my own beer from a cooler, and wait in line with people ordering food in order to get another drink. I'm not sure if they're trying to cut costs and have less staff, but if they keep the same setup, I would rather go to Pei Wei for the same level of service for half the price."
2/24/2017,1,Called to see what the hours were and the girl hung up on me after she made a smart ass answer.
2/22/2015,4,I had the cucumber avocado roll and it was phenomenal. Would absolutely go back a second time and would recommend to stop by if in downtown orlando.
2/6/2015,5,I cant say enough nice things about this place. I really love the menu and atmosphere. It can be a bit overcrowded sometimes. But I have never had an issue with service.
7/1/2016,2,"Came here for something I could eat after a wisdom teeth surgery, not the best place for that. Ordered curry, hoping it would my typical soup constancy when I order from my Thai restaurant but it was just a bunch of veggies with a little bit of sauce. I explained to the employee as I was ordering I would need something soupy since I can't chew solids yet, when the food came I asked for more sauce, and he told me it would be extra. Long story short, I gave my leftovers to the homeless since there was no way I could eat it."
8/24/2014,5,"Second time eating here. The sushi is absolutely wild, most notably the Volcano Roll & the Dragon Roll. Prices are reasonable but I'm dying to make it back there for the all you can eat sushi on Saturday afternoons!"
6/30/2014,5,Been here a few times and the food is always good. Their tuna is always fresh and their service is generally fast. Can get busy around lunch but you an order ahead online and it'll be ready when you get there!
5/14/2014,2,"This is one of many places downtown Orlando that states that they are open until 10:30PM, but not only close at 10:00PM but do not deliver.  It's really frustrating to a business traveler that relies on an accurate Yelp profile to do menu orders.  Their answer is that ""a third party delivers"" and that company, Doorstep delivery, does not accept late night orders."
3/27/2017,1,"If you call in for takeout, they'll put you on hold and never pick up the phone again. I've had this happen to me too many times for it to be an accident."
9/25/2013,5,FAVORITE!  Love this place!  We even had our Rehearsal Dinner here!  Spicy Cream Chicken is the BEST!
8/11/2014,5,Awesome place to eat before or after catching a movie at The Plaza. We've been here several times and it never disappoints. Food is great and prices are affordable.
7/27/2014,3,"Having been used to eating in the original bento cafe in Gainesville, I found this establishment lackluster. They make you sit down and wait for the waiter, basically to demand a tip. The bento cafés in Gainesville, fl just let you order food and take it to a table. It took twice as long to get our food when we were starving. If you ever drive by north Florida, be sure to stop by the original in Gainesville."
10/11/2013,4,"One of my favorite places to eat. Their prices are reasonable and the food is very fresh. During the lunch hour, you seat yourself after placing an order but at night, they change the atmosphere into seated/waited on restaurant. I love the environment here.My favorite lunch special is the bento box. Love the amount of rolls and the fact that you can choose what you want. You can substitute the standard california roll with one of their specialty or executive rolls for a dollar more. Be weary though they charge you an extra dollar for rolls with salmon or tuna on them. Not only that, if you get the california roll with the tuna on it, they change you the extra dollar for the change in roll and the extra dollar for the meat instead of just an extra dollar for just the tuna addition to the standard california roll in the  lunch special bento box.The miso soup is perfect! There is a perfect balance of flavor. I could use more tofu but other than that, delicious!I rated it 4 stars because sometimes, the waiters and waitresses get the orders wrong. I have had to send bento boxes back because the wrong bento box was grabbed and given to another customer. It happens particularly with one waitress so I try to check my order before she leaves. Minor issues compared to issues other Asian Fusion restaurants have."
3/1/2015,5,"Recently, the Amway Center has contracted Bento sushi to cater all of their events. Everything from Orlando Magic Basketball games, Solar bears Hockey games, concerts, and everything else inbetween, you will always find the bento booth right by section 108 on the second floor. Once you get there you'll meet Raul and Christina. Christina is always happy to ring you up and Raul will make you some of the best rolls, and bowls(dons) that you have ever had. Every Solar bears game I attend as a season ticket holder I go up and order the chefs special from Raul and I have yet to dislike anything he has made me. They are so incredibly friendly, well kept stations, and delicious food. Keep doing what you're doing Raul!"
9/7/2009,4,"Bento has become one of my favorite downtown stops.  The food is good.  I highly reccomend the bento boxes as they come with a ton of food.  The ricebowls are also more than enough to fill someone up.  I personally don't like sushi, but I hear it is also very good from diners I have eaten with. Overall,  I love the clean, modern urban decor of the restaurant.  It has a trendy look and feel without the price you would generally associate with that look.  The live DJ entertainment on weekend nights is also a huge plus.  The only factor that kept me from rating five stars is that service can be slow during peak times.  During the day, counter service from the bar is available, and service is generally not an issue."
2/9/2014,4,"We really like going here.  It's good sushi and other Asian style food (Thai, etc.) at a great price.  My husband prefers sushi and I prefer Thai, so it's nice to go somewhere that does both well.  The bento boxes are huge and only about $8 at dinner and the sushi costs about the same--great deal!  The only downside is that the service is often hit or miss."
9/15/2018,2,"I've been to Bento since it first opened and it's always been a great sushi place that served a good meal if you were in the area. This afternoon my boyfriend and I went to Bento and I was shocked when the whole place has been turned into Asian fast food with no more table service. You order at the counter and get a number , find yourself a table , go get your own drink from the soda fountain in a plastic cup, get utensils out of a bin and wait on your food. My boyfriend who ordered a bowl of some kind with noodles got his first and I waited well over 15 min for my sushi box combo which was $10( California roll 8 pieces , spicy tuna 4 pieces , and the caliente roll 4 pieces) . My boyfriend was halfway thru his meal by then. I have no idea why it would take that long as there seemed to be several employees and maybe four other customers who had already received their  meal.   The rolls were fine and I'm glad I didn't get more than that because the whole experience was a disappointment  ! I have typically spent  $30-40 on meals there and totally worth it for creative rolls that are fresh but there is no way I would spend that on this place anymore. The ten dollar box was totally worth it and would probably only go there if I was in the area and wanted basic sushi for cheap to go.  There are so many better options in the downtown area for quality Japanese food and a way better experience."
6/29/2014,4,"The steamed dumplings and the Florida roll have kept me coming back to Bentos since my Gainesville days. While it's not as inventive as some local sushi places, the combinations are fresh and the amount of fried rolls limited. The prices are reasonable and I have yet to be disappointed with the quality of their fish. And, the udon soup nurses a mean hangover."
12/21/2013,2,"I've been here a couple times and don't plan on going back again. This place can get really busy so you could wait a long time and then be upset when you eat the food. For one thing, they don't have real crab. I asked. It's all imitation crab. Which is not crab. It's like white fish with dye. Dont call it crab when it's not crab. Anyways... It's also a little pricey for sushi. It's just average quality food for more money. I've gotten a couple different rolls (none of which included krab) and they were alright. I would suggest Fuji Sushi for really good sushi. My boyfriend got teriyaki chicken and it was just 'okay'."
5/24/2016,3,"The food was OK. It wasn't incredible but I would say it was good. The sake wasn't as warm as it should be and the service was actually on the poor side. Our waitress walked away as my husband was ordering to take care of something else, he had to holler back at her to come back so he could finish his order. When she came back he orders his food, his two drinks and he likes spicy mayo with his sushi. Never ever brought him his soda a single time. The food took over an hour which I don't blame her for. It's really out of the waitress' control how long the food takes. When we let her know that the food was taking long she was apologetic about the kitchen being backed up and having issues or whatever which I totally understand and all but I am really good at body language so I wasn't at all convinced, she actually looked like she was being dishonest but whatever so the food came like 5 minutes later. My husband again asks for spicy mayo and it never came just like the soda. Then the bill comes in and we were automatically charged tip 18% which he crossed off and wrote the amount sans tip. I understand they work off tip but it still needs to be earned, it's not given just because or out of sympathy and we really don't feel like she did a good job. The tip was still charged anyway, pretty ballsy of you to charge something we spcified NOT to."
8/25/2013,5,"One thing about Bento is that its always the same with them every time. I always get a substantial amount of quality food for the money. Their Soy Chili is my favorite, but the Pad Thai is a close second. The TNT and Envy sushi rolls are also awesome. The Red Curry dishes are also pretty memorable, with the curry being the right amount of coconut milk and heat. The Edamame is also a mix of salty and sweet that I can't get enough of. I always go for happy hour when its not crazy busy."
7/27/2018,3,"We really enjoy the food here, but every time they get busy, they simply shut off Uber Eats. I operate restaurants for a living and I just simply cannot wrap my head around the idea of that they would choose to refuse third party delivery orders as opposed to finding a way to keep up with Guests' orders. I would assume the owner isn't aware that they're doing this... if it was my restaurant I'd be looking for a new BOH manager and/or expediter. Find a way to work more efficiently, leave your restaurant online and available for your loyal Guests and watch your sales climb... I'm really not one to complain, but this has happened 8 of the last 12 times we have ordered (varying days/nights of the week) over roughly a 3-month period. Also, each time this happens (sometimes in the middle of placing an order) I call and am told ""Yeah, we're experiencing high volume so we turned it off for the rest of the night"". Gotta go! Jumping back on UE to order dinner for four hungry Millennials!"
5/8/2013,3,"This place was a bit of a let down. Decided to walk in for lunch. When I walked in, I decided to take a look at the menu since I've never been in. There was a man at the counter taking a phone order, but it was a bit lengthy and there were not other waiters available to take my order. After about 3 minutes, I was finally helped by the man at the counter. I ordered a rainbow roll, dragon roll, and seaweed salad.I headed over to my table and waited for my food. my seaweed salad came out first and it was pretty standard. It tasted like the seaweed salad you'd get at an AYCE place. Shortly after, my rolls were delivered. I was very disappointed at the size of the rolls. They were very small. The dragon rolls was way too loaded with eel sauce, which made it a bit too sweet and overwhelming for the size of roll that I had. The fish on the rainbow roll wasn't very fresh and felt a bit stale.I really don't know if I'll be back. It was a bit of a let down but I was desperate for some quick sushi."
1/14/2011,4,"I love this place. I have tried various dishes here, and the majority of them are really good. The service is standard, nothing that really stands out. If you go here you must do the 151, TNT, and Sweetheart Rolls. They are the best! As far as Bento Boxes, I haven't had one yet (I know it kind of defeats the name's purpose), but I have had several rice bowls, and they're fantastic.My favorite is the Spicy Creamy Shrimp and Chicken Rice Bowl, Pad Thai Rice Bowl, and Beef Teriyaki Bowl. I would definitely stay away from the Seafood bowl and the Red Bean Ice Cream."
7/2/2013,3,"This hip spot in downtown Orlando deserves some attention.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive while the decor is modern and simple.  We ordered a chirashi bowl and the Japanese curry.  Both were slightly disappointing, but the presentation was very nice.  I would recommend this for beginners in the sushi world."
1/11/2014,5,My favorite go to place in Orlando! I love the sushi and food options so much I come here weekly. The staff knows us and they are all awesome as well! My favorite roll is their TNT it's a perfect combination of Spicy Tuna!
4/14/2016,1,"If McDonalds were to open a McAsian food these guys would need to worry, I made the mistake of ordering the bento hibachi steak thinking it's probably the best thing considering its steak, I was wrong. The steak was cold, chewy and resembled steak only in the fact it was beef of some manner. Would not recommend or return."
12/7/2014,3,"This is a nice place. For some reason, I thought I have posted about them in the past. I like that it is fast and the place is clean. The only small drawback is that there isn't much of a view. The place is kind of tucked away in a corner."
4/1/2014,3,"Richard Pro here with another review.Bento cafe is decent but certainly not upscale. The menus are old and sticky. The interior is a little bit too dark. Service was good.Ordered a bento box and some sushi. Had I just ordered bento, this would easily be a one star review. The rice came in small portions and was boring. The chow mein was some of the worst chow mein I've ever had. My pork katsu was crunchy and flavorless. The sauce that came with it was incredibly sweet.The sushi made up for the terrible bento box. Fresh, vibrant, and a nice blast of fresh flavor. 3 stars. Go for the sushi."
3/17/2014,4,"This place is great. The food is consistently delicious, fresh and affordable. The service isn't stellar, but it's not bad either. The restaurant is always busy at night so keep that in mind..they don't rush you but you are expected to eat and leave if there is a wait."
11/14/2015,5,"Love this place! Great atmosphere, service, and the food is yummy. Always a great go to!"
7/2/2010,2,"Asian fusion restaurants have sprouted everywhere in the past few years much to my dismay!  While the decor is often modern, sleek and trendy, the food often isn't up to par.  Bento Cafe is one such trendy asian fusion joint.It's situated in a great located in the heart of downtown Orlando smack dab next to the new movie theatre in The Plaza on Orange Ave.  During lunch, customers order at the counter and seat yourself.  Waitstaff starts at 5pm.  They do offer parking validation for orders over $10. The menu is curious but the flavors are not.  There's an extensive array of sushi and customers can choose one of many Asian dishes either as a bento box (rice, noodles, side salad and the main dish) a noodle bowl or a rice bowl.  I've tried the garlic sauce, Kung Pao and Szechuan sauces.  All of them were watery and relied too much on soy sauce for flavoring.  None of the dishes offer an array of vegetables.  Most dishes only offer one-three vegetables.  My dish came with bamboo shoots, sugar snap peas and carrots.  I wanted broccoli in place of the bamboo shoots and sugar snap peas and had to pay a $1 substitution fee.  Not bad but not great when other more authentic places in town kindly offer substitutions and/or additions.  My dish was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all.  The tofu was firm and friend well.  My favorite thing about bento besides the location was that they offer soda water at the fountain--not a good sign for an Asian restaurant.Overall, if I want to spend $20 on Asian food, next time I'll go to Thai House or Sea Thai!  Bento was a flavorless disappointment with chic ambiance and a great location."
7/3/2009,4,"You can't go wrong with the Tuna/Salmon Don rice bowls.  A generous portion of raw fish on top of sushi rice topped off with avocado, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo with caviar make up this great dish!  The sushi is average and is a bit pricey for what you get.  The cooked entree's are delicious which you can get with either rice, noodles, or as a bento box.  Bento Cafe is a quick service restaurant during lunch and morphs into a full service restaurant at night.  The ambiance is cool and hip and the service is friendly.  Would recommend to anyone that loves quick Asian food!"
5/11/2016,4,"Good environment, good food, and good service. Nothing let me down but nothing blew me away either. A solid 4 stars."
5/10/2013,3,"This was an unplanned quick meal but it was surprisingly good. We had 30 minutes before going to the movies upstairs and wanted to grab a quick small bite before stuffing our faces with popcorn. Anyway, we are very picky with sushi places as we are very spoiled in the sushi category (with our favorite restaurant being a sushi place and all). Our friends wanted to try it and it was convenient at the time.The other 3 people in my table ordered a different roll each and they were very pleased. I ordered a sashimi bowl of half spicy tuna and half salmon and this was served on a bed of rice with masago, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds and a tiny bit of seaweed salad. I was very happy with it and the fish tasted fresh which is the most important part for me. I thought it was going to be a small dish but it was nicely sized for $8. Service was pleasant and quick. Would try it again if I'm in the area. I saw some nice-looking bowls filled with steak/chicken, rice, etc. that I want to try next time."
11/9/2015,5,"Came here before a movie and was taken back by the amazing food! Our server Wanda was very knowledgable about the Saki options and helped us choose an phenomenal peach Saki. Food, atmosphere and employees were all above and beyond. Definitely coming back."
4/9/2011,4,"i like Bentos has a great atmosphere with a very friendly staff the dinning are is very clean and the staff is a little shy but very friendly. i enjoy they why the are is designed gives a very fun thermthe food is sub par and this is its only down fall the sushi i had was like every body else, although i try to order something that no other sushi place has ever time i go to a new place. i could not find a dish. would i ever go back yes the staff is nice and the dinning area is clean i would recommend this place to a person that is looking for a place to eat close by other then that its a 4 star at best"
6/21/2011,4,I love Bento! Great location. I love the Bento boxes or their sushi lunch specials. My new favorite thing that they have is the spicy tuna salad. All of the flavor of a few rolls with none of the carbs! Then I always ruin it by eating their veggie spring rolls which are perfct! My mom makes home made spring rolls all the time and I ALMOST think that Bento's rolls are better. Great place to visit when you are downtown.
4/25/2010,5,"Bento has become a regular on our feeding schedule.  The sushi is very fresh.  We really like the Hot Lava roll.  Also, try the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl.  It has the a delicious sauce with a little spice to it.  Highly recommended.  For the price, you also get a lot of food."
9/8/2011,4,"I remember my first time walking in and taking my time looking at the menu to ensure to pick just the right item. It is a place I frequent due to the location and yumminess! I skimmed through some other reviews before posting mine and yes at times the service might be slow, but during off hours its quiet and empty, but regardless of the crowds of people or sitting alone at this establishment, I have never walked away feeling I don't want to go again. Rather I think when will I come again.Another plus is regardless of what you like, you can find something there to enjoy. Some might describe it as a sushi place, but even if you aren't a sushi eater there is plenty of variety to try. Talking about it now, I now want some bento!!! So hope you go and enjoy just as much as I do!"
3/2/2016,4,I had a Bento Box with Shrimp and Broccoli and it was really good. Good price as well!
6/27/2012,4,"Bento Cafe is good for what it is. It is cheap sushi (8.95 for the 12 piece combo box--4 pieces each of two rolls of your choosing then 4 pieces of California roll, $9.95 for Chirashi)  and the two experiences I've had have been good. Service was fine both times, the atmosphere is nice, and we were able to order for lunch and take out for dinner for the same price as we normally pay for one sushi meal.The Chirashi was a nice portion for a one person meal, especially with the free appetizer that comes with a Yelp check-in. It is also the cheapest I've found in town and the fish was fresh enough to make it worth it. I actually like the mackerel, which was surprising since it's not a fish I'm normally impressed by. With my free appetizer I got the Fried Cheese Wontons that reminded me of the same dish from Pei Wei with the slightly spicy dipping sauce that came with it. Nice and crispy, easy to pull apart and actually see the Krab inside. With the sushi combo box we ordered the Florida roll and the Special Mexican roll, which ended up being so good we ordered a second for dinner. The Florida roll was just a small amount of cream cheese with the fish which carried the texture and flavor of the tuna and salmon wonderfully while the Special Mexican roll was nice and crispy with a great shrimp flavor that was complimented by the eel sauce, the spicy mayo, and the cream cheese. The rest of our order was okay, but nothing I would reorder. We got the Sweetheart roll, the Neo Tokyo Kawaii, and the Spicy Salmon Don. I wasn't a huge fan of their sweet chili sauce and the Neo Tokyo Kawaii was covered in it. The tuna was better in the Florida roll then the Neo Tokyo Kawaii, which was a bit mushy in texture for having cucumber and lettuce both in it; I would have preferred another Special Mexican roll over the Sweetheart in both flavor and price for something featuring shrimp tempura. The Salmon Don had a bit of a drab salmon flavor and the pieces were at times almost too tiny to grab with chop sticks. In closing, stick with the cheaper stuff on the menu because it tends to be better than expected and the less cheap stuff seems to not be Bento's forte."
3/13/2013,4,"I really did like this place. The items we got were very good. We were there for an event and we were served Fried Cheese Wonton, Sushi, and chicken that was fried I never got the name of it. They were like chicken nuggets with a sauce and they were so good. The servers came around and asked us if we wanted more and we were full. Very nice place. Very classy. All kinds of people come in here. Very busy the night we showed up. Seems they have several locations. Gotta check it out."
2/6/2011,4,Mmmm I shared a bento box and sushi box with a friend and we had tons of delicious food!  I think we had the Mexican roll and I would definitely recommend that one. Nice atmosphere and great food!
10/22/2008,4,"Bento Cafe is an exciting addition to the downtown Orlando sushi scene. Its kind of hard to find, look under the escalators in the new Orange St. complex that's home to Urban Flats and Corona Cigars. The decor is modern and exciting, really invoking thoughts of what a trendy downtown place to grab a bite should be. Cool art hangs from the ceiling attached to lights and sleek styled booths and tables fill the space. There is a raw bar, though not to actually sit at, and a few flat screen scattered about. But the real fun starts when the food arrives. Their creative roll choices and old favorites are scrumptious for dinner or a pre night out snack. Try the special mexican roll, its a popular choice and mouth wateringly good. And the sashimi bowls are tender and filling. But for those of you that regard eating raw fish as a punishment to your stomach don't fret. This little cafe is a Japanese fusion restaurant so you can find anything from fried shrimp, to noodle dishes, to spicy teriyaki chicken with rice on the menu. And of course they offer the bento box, thus the name. But don't forget the saki! Bento has many choices, my personal favorite being the lychee. Its a house specialty so a wine sized bottle of it is moderately priced at $20. The sparkling saki is also refreshing to the palate. Bento's food is cheap as far as this type of cuisine goes and though there are always some patrons inside chatting and munching its never a crowded atmosphere, snagging a table even for large parties is a breeze. If you're really looking for a steal head over between 4-7pm on weeknights. Happy hour brings about 2 for 1 rolls and drink specials. Bento's is a great little cafe offering pretty much anything you might expect in the way of Asian cuisine incuding some concoctions destined to become new favorites."
2/6/2016,5,My daughter is home sick so it was great to be able to have great food delivered to her. This is the restrauant she wanted delivery from she eats there often. She loves the Mexican Roll and Udon Noodle soup.
1/26/2012,5,"Gotta love Bento! Atmosphere, food and price is all great. I prefer their Bento box over their sushi rolls. My personal favorite is the Spicy Cream Chicken box.  Actually one night it was six of us and 4 of 6 ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken box - it's delicious! Also, I'll found the portion size of chicken to be more generous at this downtown location compared to the one on Sand Lake.  I highly recommend, you will definitely find something on the menu that you will like."
5/26/2010,5,"I have to try and go to Bento at least once a week, it's that good!  They have a wide range of menu items, from two different kinds of bowls, a bento box, and sushi.  The menu is reasonably priced and service is decent.  The only down side of the menu is that they don't have a full bar- just wine, beer, and sake.  This location is the ""blue"" bento and the decor is very trendy and cool.  At lunch its counter service and at night its a full service restaurant.  I recommend for any time a day! Also Bubble tea is awesome!"
8/20/2012,5,"Great food, friendly service and wonderful atmospere. It's definately great for families, date night or just a fun girls night out."
10/9/2013,5,"Fantastic service, the food is excellent, price is low, and the portions are more than generous."
4/8/2013,4,"We hit this place for lunch with a group and had a great time. They have a great menu with lots of choices. Speaking of, can you turn the lights up just a titch in there? I had to pull out my phone to read the flipping thing. I digress...the food was good. I had a bento box, of course. Very tasty. The worst/best part about this place is the location. It's right smack downtown but parking is not easy. The garage that backs up to the plaza has to be among the worst ever. It was made in another country, I'm sure. A country where cars are 8 feet long and 4 feet wide. Just awful. It's a little loud but that's to be expected downtown."
12/9/2011,3,"Busy, bustling and tasty, but the staff doesn't seem to be able to keep up at the downtown location.  Or maybe they just don't care?  I seemed to see a lot of standing around..."
12/14/2013,5,"I had the Spicy Creamy Chicken. It was one of best Asian restaurants even compared to my trips to San Fransisco,CA and NY. Highly suggest it!"
7/2/2015,4,Good value and quality sushi and sashimi. Consider ordering online as a single ordering counter may cause a line if they're busy.
6/28/2017,1,"My girlfriend and I showed up to this location on June 24th, 2017 at 10:03 pm, one hour PRIOR to closing. Apparently, a few hours prior to closing they make everyone order all their sushi and other dishes (to include drinks) right away before even being seated. You were forced to pay and submit a tip prior to getting any service which I was not a fan of. Regardless, we ordered and picked our booth. Upon sitting down we had a dirty table which took them a while to clean considering they were not busy (even on a Saturday). We were given our Sake really quickly which was nice but were never offered water or dining utensils. Once our food came out we realized we needed utensils (forks and chopsticks) and napkins. We were then given one plastic fork with a paper napkin and then one regular metal fork. They claim it was due to the fact that they haven't done dishes. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! Keep in mind, its only been 10 minutes and they still have 45 minutes until close. We ate our food with one each plastic fork and one each metal fork. We asked to speak to the manager to explain our lack of utensils and our lack of water and napkins. The manager comes up and just relays that he'll ""smack them on the hand"" then brought us our waters but still did nothing to compensate for the shitty service we had. Considering it was a Saturday night and they had over 9 free tables and it was an hour prior to closing, this service was unacceptable. I have been here many times (much closer to closing) and had great service. The service was an absolute travesty."
2/7/2011,4,"I really enjoy Bento. I go during lunch (just be prepared for a lunch rush and to seat yourself) and during dinner. Dinner is a little less high paced and you have table service. It's a mixture of sushi and regular Chinese dishes. Its like really good Chinese food without the possibility of MSG. I can't stand MSG. It's unhealthy and gives me a headache. Bento is fresh and flavorful. Bento is also in an area that holds a bar, movie theater, coffee shop, and fro yo. So you can have dinner, dessert and a movie in one stop. If you feel frisky the clubs/bars are all in walking distance."
7/24/2011,2,"We stopped at Bento Cafe for  quick snack before the movies yesterday.   There is something wrong with the set up in here.  The tables are too close together and it just has a claustrophobic feel.  They should probably work on their Feng Shui.   Also, the ""techno/ dance remix"" music was turned up so loud we could barely hear each other.  Our server was a little pushy and seamed eager to get us out the door as soon as possible. Most every aspect of this restaurant made me feel on edge.  My husband and I both ordered a ""Don"", which is basically a bowl of rice with raw fish, roe, avocado and seaweed salad on top.  It was pretty good and the price was right ($7.95).  We finished the meal with a bowl of red bean ice cream. Though Bento is not the best sushi in town, it is certainly not the worst either."
11/18/2015,4,"Yum, yum!  Average price, good menu.  Good taste.  Authentic."
8/20/2015,5,"Very good sushi. California rolls in other places are generally only ""okay"" but I was impressed with the taste of the California rolls here. They also have good specials when ordering multiple rolls."
3/4/2012,5,I love sushi.  I love pad thai.  I love working downtown so close to Bento that I can eat lunch there at least 2 times a week.  The Vegetarian Roll is fantastic as is their pad thai.  Love Love Love it!
4/2/2015,4,"This is a small place, located under the Plaza Cinema. I visited at 9:30pm on a Thursday, and it was super crowded and busy. I was flying solo, but still got friendly service here. My spicy tuna roll and volcano roll were good."
8/30/2011,4,"I like here and I go there quite often.Their food are cheap and very fair for the price and their service. I had Katsu(both bento Box and Rice ball), Bulgogi Box, Chirashi, and Sushi and so far I like them all. (If you are hungry make sure you'll ask a waiter/waitress how big it is. I thought Chirashi was a bit smaller than others... well sorry if I'm wrong.)   The manager here is VERY helpful and friendly too. I also like the fact that they are closed to the a movie theater."
10/20/2011,4,"The best thing about this place is that looks so high end but its very affordable. It's in the heart of downtown in The Plaza on Orange Avenue so parking is pretty difficult unless you park in the garage. A great date place without spending a lot of money. Almost everyone there looked like they were on a date. If you are alone, you can sit at the bar.I got a Spicy Cream Chicken bento bowl which came with chicken, peppers, broccoli, noodles, rice, ginger salad and a coconut white cake dessert. It was only 8 or 9 bucks but it was so filling and the best part was the spicy chicken. It wasnt too spicy at all as well as nice and moist. The broccoli was dried out but the noodles were great. The portion wasnt small or large - it was just right. Normally the portions are so large I have to take food home but this was just nicely filling. Huge menu. Vegetarian options and interesting beer selection.The food came in five minutes - not kidding! I looked at my watch because someone reviewed that it was slow as molasses but literally the food came in five minutes! It wasnt dead but a moderately busy weekday night.The place looks very classy, sleek and modern with the theme of black going on. Super high ceilings. Surrounded by glass with granite tables. About the validated parking - we were there 45 minutes and, even after they validated the parking, we still had to pay $2.50. Also, the parking garage is SO scary. The corners are so tight and there are marks all over the walls where people ran into it. The parking was extremely difficult and there were no spots so we ended up parking on the level that was reserved for valet parking (shh, dont tell!). Will go again ! :)"
9/25/2012,3,"The food here is amazing. I ordered a Bento Box and a Tekka Don for lunch -- I was very hungry! The service is pretty awful in my opinion, no one poured our water and we had to do it ourselves. Service here is definitely strange/borderline awful."
4/22/2013,3,"It's not bad sushi, but it's not good sushi.  It's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's definitely a decent spot for a Chirashi bowl or some Sashimi."
11/15/2015,5,"I can't stand seaweed which is why I steer clear of sushi, but they have a selection made with rice paper and it was great! Very satisfying meal and very healthy. We were able to party after dinner and not feel that overstuffed, with over processed food feeling."
8/2/2008,5,"Orlando Bento is just as good as its Gainesville predecessors. When I'm in Orlando, this is where I go eat because it's my favorite Japanese restaurant ever. Their bento boxes are good; their sushi is AMAZING. Bento is what I miss most about living in Florida, no lies. Super cheap, super tasty. I love you, Bento."
9/16/2011,5,Everything here is great! From the sushi to the bento box. I love the Sushi Don!
12/24/2011,4,"This is my favorite place to go after a show -- it's open late and the sushi is always fantastic.  Check out the ""bowls"" on their menu for the best value -- the salmon bowl is pretty great."
4/9/2012,1,"I've been to this place a few times, only because it's by the movie theater and it's convenient. I think i'll make an effort to go somewhere else next time. The food is so BLAND and lackluster. It's almost like a frozen tv dinner and a side of canned food. The staff is so standoffish and it seems like it's an effort to take our order. It's also really slow, the last time we went it was so empty and yet, they still managed to be as slow as if it was rush hour on a Saturday night. I can understand why people like this place, it looks trendy, it's cheap, and has a perfect location. But I would not waste my money here."
8/13/2015,3,"I'd say this place is definitely good but not great. The service was good and food came pretty quickly. The location was also great if you are doing anything downtown. If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would. I can't go for 4 stars because of menu. Too many rolls on this menu have imitation krab. I'm not a fan. I feel like a high quality sushi restaurant doesn't go for that much imitation meat. We are new to the area from California and I've heard this is common for sushi restaurants in Orlando. They also have tilapia on some rolls. I have never see this at a sushi restaurant before. In my experience, tilapia is mostly farmed, not wild. This makes me question the quality of the other seafood being used. The rolls that we did order were good, though we opted to pay the up charge to substitute some of the lower quality fish for better selections. I would go back here because of location. If location was not a factor and I was simply looking for good sushi, this would not be my choice."
10/3/2009,5,"if you are coming downtown, this to me is the most versitale place to eat.. cheap, good, and perfect location...  service is slower then most, but worth it.  i eat here a minimum of 5 times a week.a must if your going to the movies..dont forget to get your parking validated !!"
5/23/2010,4,"Food is excellent and the price is cheap, but you better have time to waste cause service moves like a snail. On the bright side they are quick to comp a drink cause it's so bad."
7/29/2011,3,"Amazing! I always order the volcano roll and Japanese bagel roll. Though the volcano roll is amazing, it is not the traditional shredded ""krab"" meat mixed with spicy mayo atop a california roll. Still truly amazing! My boyfriend always orders the bento box with a variety of items and also comes with a cute little dessert. The shrimp tempura is MY favorite. I have also had the spicy tuna don. This also comes with a seaweed salad that, to my surprise, tasted awesome. The reason I am not giving Bento 5 stars is because of the times I have sat down to eat here and the to go system. First, every time I eat here service is horrible. Most of the servers are rude and cannot keep the orders accurate. You have to get your own refills and sometimes wait over an hour for your food. Also 2x when i ordered to go, my order wasn't even processed! They charge $0.50 for spicy mayo when most places will give you as much as you want for free. I always need to check my order and receipt because it is never correct (missing soy sauce a lot) and they charge me for stuff I didn't order.In conclusion, food is AMAZING, service is HORRIBLE!"
11/28/2012,1,"Nothing Japanese about this placeLoudTv's everywhere ,bad serviceFood was fair"
12/21/2012,4,Love to come here! The bento boxes are always a great deal and just enough sushi for me. Also the staff have always been pleasant :) My daughter really enjoys it here too.
1/3/2013,2,It took almost 15 minutes to place a take out order with only 2 people in front of me.  For the next 30 minutes I waited and watched them botch every single order.  It was comical.  When I finally received my food I left out of frustration without checking it.  I made it 200 feet outside before I was chased down because I was given the wrong bag.Food was good but we have too many choices in Orlando to put up with such terrible service.
8/26/2010,4,Very nice restaurant inside and very clean. my last visit i had this bento box and it was very good. Only been there once and i am going to say a good time to dine on an evening. Service seems very professional and well mannered. Great sushi too by the way! thank you staff and chefs!!!
1/25/2012,5,"Awesome food. Very tasty. Friendly staff. I have eaten here for years, never had any issues. Hot, fresh tasting noodles or bento boxes! Yummy sushi! Sushi lunch special is the best, high quality low price."
10/5/2012,5,"I love this place! It's got a great combo of Asian dishes and sushi; so it's a perfect when I am out with my non-sushi friends.  I have pretty much tried everything on the menu but prefer the Curry Katsu and Spicy Cream along with any sushi they make.  Love that you can choose between Shrimp, Chicken and Beef with most of the dishes so the variety is awesome! The staff is always delightful and always ready to suggest something.  And the prices is awesome! Their edemame is the best in town by the way."
2/28/2013,5,I don't like sushi and I'm extremely picky about my fried rice (it can easily be ruined). I took one bite out of my fried rice bowl and fell in love with Bento. The prices are amazing and I can't wait to try more of their menu. The portions were perfect and the employees were friendly and took great care of us. Can't wait to go back and get another bowl of friend rice :-)
4/21/2015,5,I get my sushi from Bento at the Solar Bears games. It's the only place I'll get food from in the arena because it's the BEST! Please come back next season. If you don't I'll go hungry at the games!
4/10/2015,5,These guys are great. What a treat to have them at the magic games. It's delicious and one of the only healthy options. I hope to see them in Orlando city's new stadium!
6/7/2013,5,I love Bento!! every time I go visit my ex in orlando we eat here. We especially love the bubba tea and the bento box!!!! And the owner Johnny is very nice as well. Very clean restaurant and the staff always has a big smile on whenever I go. I definitely recommend Bento to all my friends and family.
12/27/2012,5,"Bento is hands down my favorite lunch spot in downtown Orlando. Their call-in service is so quick (I have my food within 10 minutes of calling in) and the portions are filling and generous.I'm impressed by all of their veggie options ( and their menu clearly designates which items are vegetarian). Their tofu blows me away, and I don't say that lightly. It's always chewy and flavorful, never soggy. Even my omnivore friends order the tofu  occasionally - it's that good.The red curry tofu noodle bowl is my all time favorite. It's so creamy, spicy and perfect that I almost always pick it (although the garlic sauce and the basic stir fry are winners too)."
7/7/2010,4,Went to lunch here today for the first time and it was very nice! there was this tempura shrimp covered in a spicy sauce kinda tasted like the spicy mayo sauce they have and it came with white rice .... it was incredibly delicious! then i had the mexican roll but instead of eel sauce i had it with spicy mayo - as you can tell i was in the mood for spicy - but nonetheless it was pretty impressive and very chilling ... especially watching the germany vs spain world cup game! :p
10/30/2010,5,Just came back from Bento Cafe. 10/30/10.I spent Appx: $10 including tip and tax.Ordered: Thai Coconut Yellow Curry Bento BoxFood Quantity: 10/10Food Quality or Taste: 7/10Food Price: 10/10   You get more then what you paid for.Food Menu Choices: 10/10  There's many to choose from.Wait Time: 15 minutes after ordering.I would sacrifice the small portion of yakisoba and string beans for a decent portion of salad and little bit of extra rice.  I like the small dessert portion they provide with the bento meal.Recommend: 10/10For Age: 21 to 35
1/19/2011,5,"I don't know much about traditional or authentic Japanese, but this is my FAVORITE sushi spot! I always go for the Lunch combo, where you can choose two types of regular rolls and you get 4 each, plus 4 California rolls. Your box also comes with a cucumber salad (I think it's called sunomono), seaweed salad (YUM!) and your rolls. All for $8 -- PERFECT for a lunch.My favorite rolls are the Mt. Fuji, Spicy Hotate and Special Mexican. There are also a bunch of ""executive rolls"" which are fancier -- more expensive, tho, and not allowed in the lunch box combo.I'm confused by those who talk about bad service in this place, tho, because it's not really that type of operation. It's counter service, where you go up, place your order & you get a number for your table, so they can bring your order out to you. You even go get your own drinks. What kind of service do you want in a place like that?I've rarely had a less than great experience at this place. Last time I was there, I decided to step away from my usual lunch combo and try the Kawaii rolls -- lighter version, wrapped in lettuce. It was good, but WAYYY too small for me. I left still incredibly hungry.The boba bar is gone (rumor has it it's going to return at Mochi next door very soon) and I understand they're not validating parking in The Plaza's structure anymore. But if you're lucky enough to be able to walk over there or can find street parking, it is definitely worth every penny!"
3/17/2011,5,"I'm mostly in line with dear Tabitha on this review, great food, great place, and theirs a yummy yogurt shop next door more or less. If I had the money it'd be my regular sunday sushi place with the girlfriend."
11/22/2011,1,"So, Bento and I have a bit of a history. I used to order from them all the time on Doorstep Delivery because I wanted to try some sushi rolls in the comfort of my own home. The delivery food was awesome, and was always delicious. Let me be clear, the food is great but...Good luck getting any of that delicious food. The wait staff ignored my wife and I on at least two separate occasions, and from what I'm told, this happens more often than not. So, for delivery, this place is excellent. If you want to actually go to the location, forget it."
3/11/2012,5,"This is one of the best restaurants i've been to in a very long time, and I live near New York City. I food was excellent, i'd say 4.8 out of 5 but what gives it the 5 stars is the overall package. The restuarant design is very nice and modern, the waitress was very friendly and the overall ambience was great. The portions of the food are really big, and I have enough left overs for breakfast. On top of all this is the very reasonable price: if you want to, you can have a really filling dinner for $7.50. I ordered a little bit of everything so I paid more but for everything I got I still had a great deal. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this place is so that you people don't steal it and drive up the prices!"
6/17/2014,4,"I ordered in from Bento, and I was a little worried with the estimated 1 hour wait for the sushi to arrive, but it was delivered in half the time, and the dumplings were still hot! The sushi was good, but I haven't tried enough items on the menu to really pick out what's great and what is so-so, but I'd recommend it, and I'll be ordering from here again."
5/9/2012,1,"Waited for my food for over a half hour, meanwhile I was told it was ""on it's way"". If you forget to make an order just say so, don't lie and make me waste my time. Not worth it."
8/3/2013,3,"I have been to bento cafe in downtown Orlando multiple times and have had the same problem with varying severity: timeliness of seating. Being well versed in how a dining room and patrons should be handled, more often than not, the typical 20-25 minute wait doesn't bother me as I'm usually there on the weekend and 20-25 minutes to be seated seems reasonable to me. However, tonight's experience was bad enough that I felt a review was necessary. I gave 3 stars because the food is always good and at a fantastic value, it borders on great with some dishes. But I came in tonight to celebrate my girlfriend's graduation with her family and was quoted at a 20-25 minute wait. With there being 6 of us, that's no problem. But there were roughly 30 available seats. After waiting 45 minutes I asked why we couldn't sit in any of those available seats and I was told that they were reserved. What restaurant holds a reservation for 30 people for an hour past their reserved time on a Saturday night? During that time, at least 15 people walked out due to frustration. Had they not found a table at the last second, we would've left, too. I understand trying to be patient, but you don't turn away guaranteed business for a group that probably won't show. In case you were wondering, the group never came. If you don't learn how to manage a dining room, great food is going to waste."
7/31/2010,5,"I love Bento! I usually eat here at least once a week ever since being turned on to the place two years ago. I have never had a bad meal there. Ever. The food there is really special. Depending on my mood, I either go with sushi, or a noodle bowl. Can't lose either way. Thing is, they could really get away with charging a bit more, especially in the location it's in. The food is that good! The atmosphere is also fantastic. It's got a really nice, chilled out vibe to it. Modern, and trendy, but not stuck up. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. For my friends and I, so many great nights downtown have first started out with a great meal at Bento! Enjoy!"
4/24/2011,5,"Bento was awesome. The decor is amazing. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The restroom is also very interesting, they have a TV in the wall so you do not miss any of the game. I really enjoyed all the food. I did not get to try the sushi yet but the menu looks amazing. I did however get the bento box. It is basically a 3 course meal. It includes a salad and a dessert. I also had the Sakitini. I don't usually like Saki, but I got an apple flavored one and it was really good.The other thing I really loved about it, is that it is so reasonably prices. You can get an entire meal for $10 which is unheard of Downtown."
6/6/2011,4,"So good.  Perfect stop before you hit the movies.  Great looking place, they are fast sweet servers.I love the Asian American cuisines, they only bad food I had was some of there sushi rolls aren't great."
3/7/2012,5,"My girlfriend and I just got home and couldn't wait to write a review. We were very very pleased with the service here. Our waitress was Tammy, and she was talkative, knew her stuff, and was very attentive. It is my birthday today, and my girlfriend's was five days ago, so we were celebrating. And turning 21, we were curious about the alcohol. We ordered two glasses of wine and sampled the sake. We weren't charged for the alcohol, and were given some free Red Bean Ice Cream-- which was yummy. Now I'm boasting, but really, the food was great, well-prepared. It was my girlfriend's first time eating sushi, and now she loves it. We want to become regulars there, it was that good. The prices were very fair as well, especially considering they are in the middle of downtown Orlando.The atmosphere was mellow, fancy, and still casual. I'm no professional, but it's a great place for a first-timer, for a sushi lover, and we stuck to the sushi, but I'm sure all their other stuff is great too. ^^ We ordered some sushi to go, as well. :D We'll definitely be back. P.S-- The Crunch Roll is a must-have!"
7/4/2012,5,Amazing food and atmosphere.  Very good and fresh sushi.  A must check out in Orlando.
12/10/2009,3,"From a Californian's perspective, this place is pretty good because of one thing - the prices! An average descent roll in California is about $10-12, at Bento it's $7! Can't beat that! One gripe though, when the description states spicy, then it should be SPICY! I didn't taste spicyness. I should've brought along my Tabasco for added taste to the rice bowls."
12/12/2009,2,"My friend and I went here for a quick bite before a movie.  We split sushi, soup and pad thai.  If I did not know that we had ordered pad thai, I would have never guessed.  It wasn't bad, or good, but I wouldn't order it again.  The hot and sour soup was neither sour or spicy.  The sushi had too much rice and not enough fish.  With all the other dining options around, I don't see myself coming here again."
10/22/2013,2,Came in on a Sunday night and ordered a lychee sake (they were out so we ordered the white peach...which was the only one they had anyway..) green tea ice cream and a spicy seafood noodle soup bowl. After two tables that had sat down after us received their food and the server never came back after dropping off our waters we had grabbed another server to check on our food. She came back and said she had just fired our order which we had already been waiting 25-30 mins for? Then our original server came back and said our order had been overlooked and then said our entire meal was comped....thanks? I'm assuming the server was new and having our meal comped I gave the two stars.
3/2/2014,3,"I've visited to Bento on three occasions; twice for dine in and once for carry out. Overall the food quality, prices and portions are ok. That being said I only rated 3 stars as the product quality is mediocre at best. Having sampled from both their sushi and hot offerings I found the rice and noodle bows to be the best items. For lunch you can't beat their prices and the staff & atmosphere have always been welcoming."
6/1/2013,3,"This place is ok.  I've been to this place twice.  Once I ate at the bar the second I was with a party of five.  The first time at the bar I was attended very well and the food was delivered without a hitch. The second time it was disastrous.  They sat us down in a booth and then the waitress took forever to take our drink orders.  Then she forgot to put in the order for our appetizers, once she did get around to putting the order in she put it in wrong.   The food took a really long time to come out, as we were sitting waiting for our food we noticed that the sushi chefs were just standing around the food preparation are while there were orders still to come out of the kitchen and the sushi bar.   The only reason that I'm give it three stars is due to the food quality.  You have to know what to order on the menu for you to get good to excellent items, there are other on the menu that don't stand up."
8/5/2013,3,"Really good sushi, but ho-hum bento. My main dish was okay, but the accompanying noodles and beans were quite dry and flavorless (not even soy sauce could moisten the noodles), and the salad and dessert were throwaways (which is kind of to be expected, given the cuisine). The chicken katsu was amazing--not too heavy or greasy at all. I liked the ambience and decor, but unfortunately the women's bathroom was disgusting. I'd go again for takeout sushi or a rice bowl, but not much else."
7/17/2013,4,"Went here on a whim, glad we did. Sushi roll was good and the garlic chicken was delicious without being over the top. Wife had the Orange chicken with noodles and she loved it. We will definitely be back to try the other bentos!"
10/18/2010,2,"This place is not good.  We went here for lunch today and I was pretty excited b/c there were a bunch of people waiting for them to open.  (We got there a little too early).  The food came out slow b/c we were seated with a few other tables.  We tried the veggie spring rolls that tasted store bought and came with packets of duck sauce on the side on a gross piece of lettuce for decoration.  We also had the katana roll which was the best thing we had there.  I made the mistake of ordering the tuna tataki salad bowl which had no flavor at all.  It was by far the worst tuna tataki I've ever had.  We also ordered a roll that was wrapped in cucumber (can't remember what it was called).  It was just ok.  I had the sliced beef udon noodle soup and he had the cajun chicken noodle bowl.  The broth of my soup was really dark brown which was odd.  It was just ok.  I was staarving when we went here (I didn't have breakfast)  so it probably wouldnt have been that hard to impress, but that just shows how bad the food was!  Our bill came out and it was $60 with tip.  What a waste!"
7/26/2013,4,"Since writing the initial review I have visited Bento 3-4 times, with the most recent visit a few days ago. When dining here it has been a positive experience and the food has been great! I might add, the way that the owner handled my last review was above and beyond what I was expecting and really served to make me feel like a valued customer. Will keep Bento in mind as a food option when downtown."
4/21/2010,4,My favorite quick sushi lunch spot. They have great sushi bowls and salad bowls. They have fast service and good food.
6/30/2009,4,This is owned by one of my friend's friend. It's a cool hip Asian fusion place to go to. I do prefer their rice and noodle bowls over their sushi. It's inexpensive and a quick eats type of place. I prefer to go there for lunch.
4/21/2010,4,"This is a good, fast place to get sushi. I have never tried anything other than sushi here, and I haven't had a bad experience. Their volcano roll is pretty good. It is more of a quick lunch spot than a dining experience, but I was impressed with their sushi. I tried a Boba drink before and I am personally not a fan, but if you like that sort of thing maybe you'd like them there. Their seaweed salad was always good, too. Give it a try."
9/2/2012,4,"I was looking for a light lunch and ended up ordering a dragon roll. It was pretty standard, though the sweet sauce on top was really delicious. The cashier was very friendly and struck up conversation while she was ringing my order up. Great value for the price- I love sushi but can never find a place that won't leave my wallet completely empty, and this did it for me. I'll definitely have to try a bento box next time I pay them a visit."
1/28/2013,2,"I've  coming to Bento Downtown Orlando for some time for lunch.  I am addressing the lunch experience and have not been here for Dinner.  At lunch time, you stand in line to order before being seated (Similar to fast food).  They subsequently hand you a plastic number, and you go on your way and wait for your food to arrive (it is brought to the table in a one time trip from the server).  Typically, if you order there anytime after 11:30, you are faced with a cramped long line at the door.  Call ahead ordering is a little better, but make sure you order at around 11, as you are still forced to wait in the long line of people who did not call ahead.  While they claim to have a register dedicated to pick up, it is not clearly labeled as such, and you face scowls from those waiting in line who believe you are cutting in front of them.There are two menu styles.  I have tried both, with varying measures of satisfaction.  The sushi receives a higher grade than the bento boxes or rice bowls.  The regular rolls are generously portioned and the executive rolls are equally generous.  The executive rolls, while pricier, are generally tastier and more creative.  I have had only one bad experience with the sushi where the scallops that topped my roll were overcooked.  Overall, the sushi and rolls get a solid A-.  The rice bowls and bento boxes are inconsistent.  One day, they are good when ordered, while other days they are not as good.  This inconsistency has caused me to Order these entrees with caution or not at all.  For this reason, the bento boxes and rice/noodle bowls get a C-The most compelling reason behind two stars as opposed to three or even four is the service.  I have never had incredible service here, but my most recent visit (today) has left me wondering if I ever want to return. It should be noted that there are not a lot of choices for lunch in Downtown Orlando.  As such, I will probably be returning when I get tired of the scarce other choices in Orlando, but if so, it is under protest.  Upon receipt of a large bill for payment, the person who was taking my Order informed me that she did not have change.  While I understand that it was a large bill, I would expect a place in the middle of downtown Orlando to have change at least have access to a manager who does.  She didn't bother to ask a manager to assist.  She instead displayed and attitude and became combative when I insisted that I had nothing smaller.  She even went so far as to request that I go get change from somewhere else.Finally, when I persisted that I did not have anything smaller, and was unwilling to go anywhere unless she accepted my bill, she proceeded to get me the change that she claimed she did not have.  In my opinion, this Bento location has a history of hiring young attractive women to work the front registers.  However, attractiveness does not compensate for insufficient problem solving and customer service skills."
10/26/2008,4,"Hell's good stuff!   went there on our way downtown and it looks a little highend for me, we checked out the menu and the staff was great!   they helped us with our order and we had a blast!!!"
11/19/2022,5,Love their bento box and mex rollToo Love the Thai soup aswellCustomer service is great
11/18/2022,3,"I would still have to say this place is a solid three stars.I received a virtual gift card, and two of the staff had no idea how to put it into the computer to apply it. It took a few tries, but they finally figured it out.Food is just alright. I ordered the sushi bento again which I found some of the sushi pretty bland, and my husband tried the udon soup which he said the same. Boba tea is pretty good, but I asked to sub the honey Boba for popping boba, and they wanted to charge .75 for it so I kept the honey boba. I can get if I wanted to add extra boba, but I don't understand charging to substitute when you're taking something away.Service was a lot faster than last time, but for some reason, even though the server double checked, we asked to dine in and they put to go.This is a place I'd come to again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for. I'd definitely come just for boba if I'm in one of the plazas on Sand Lake."
9/16/2022,1,Second time I've given then a chance in the past two weeks. Last time they had us waiting more than 20 minutes for a chicken and veggie bowl...... As I watched ppl come in and be deuces in 5 minutes. I cancelled the order.I'm sitting here now waiting on a simple to go order since they haven't had air conditioning for a week..... No fans in the dining room...Ridiculous
12/13/2022,5,This restaurant is a gem. The atmosphere and ambiance is nice. It does resemble an authentic Asian restaurant. You have to order at the desk and get a number but it moves fast and the staff is engaging. Staff will help you with choices and recommendations. The food is wonderful. We have only tried the Mt Fuji roll and the Hot lava roll. The Hot Lava roll is absolutely amazing. It does have cooked scallops on the top so seafood allergy people beware. If not allergic it is well worth it. The prices are reasonable and they are military and veteran friendly with a 10% discount. I do not give recommendations easily but I recommend you try this spot
7/12/2022,4,"Having never been here before, I was told by a friend that I NEEDED to try it. When we walked up I was pleasantly surprised by the menu options and the service. It was a busy Saturday night but the woman still helped me and answered all my questions. I ordered a bento box with tofu as well as a Lychee boboa tee milk smoothie. The smoothie came out right away and was very good. The rest of the food came out shortly after and the tofu, rice and noodles were delicious. The side green beans and salad left some to be desired but overall it was a meal. I was a bit unhappy with the dirtiness of the place as well as the pricing ( two meals and a smoothie for 47 dollars) but overall it is a place I will be visiting again."
1/25/2022,3,"Went with the Pao pao chicken ($14) (they did not have shrimp available) and the add on of a pork egg roll and a drink for $4.5.The meal was good, green and red peppers were crisp and the string beans were not soggy either. Service was quick and I was back to work."
3/1/2022,3,"Yum! So many options, so little time. Really enjoyed this quick serve Asian restaurant which offers sushi, bowls and stir fry options. I opted for the Sesame Stir Fry in a white rice bowl with shrimp. I was surprised to find 6 shrimp in the bowl which is a more ample serving than most places. It came with roasted veggies like broccoli, zucchini, carrots, red peppers and mushrooms in a soy sauce. Really tasty and generous portion. Coke fountain beverage options along with Boba teas and beers. You order at the counter, and the food is brought to your table. Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices. Low FODMAP and gluten-free eaters may find it challenging to find onion or GF options with all the sauces. A little on the pricey side, but the food was fresh. Nice lunch option."
5/18/2022,3,"This was my first time trying a restaurant like this. Me and my family came in on a Saturday night, there wasn't much of a line and it wasn't packed. I like the amount of varieties/ options their menu has. You could literally mix and match anything you wanted, and ordering was very simple. Our appetizers came out in about 5 minutes and our food followed behind about 8 minutes after. Everything was hot, and although all of us got something very different everything was correct. All of us enjoyed our food, my only thing is I wish I received more teriyaki sauce with my bowl and I wish the noddles were more flavorful. Other than that it was good."
11/28/2022,5,The place was clean and the staff was nice and attentive. We had a party of 3 and everyone ordered a different meal. The service was pretty quick and the food was prepared correctly. As for taste - very good is a great way to summarize it. Overall a great spot.
2/3/2022,5,Another winner for me. I love this place. It's right next to my friends apartment and the food is just so delicious. I go for their General Tso Chicken bowl w/ extra green beans because it's just so good and crunchy. I also love their garlic edamame. Every time i went there it was for to go. So I haven't dined inside but I am sure it's a great experience. I definitely try to come here at least once a month since it is a 15 min drive from my home.
1/3/2022,4,Stopped at Bento's on the way to Trader Joe's with my son for dinner. I don't frequent Bento's often. We ordered 2 build your own bowls and 2 bobas. I ordered a kids bowl with 1 protein and my son ordered a regular. When they brought our bowls out they forgot my avocado but chopped some up for me when I brought my bowl up to them. After all the poke places I have been to around town I think I like Bento's for the variety of toppings available. I had shiitake mushrooms and my son added kimchi to his bowl. Those are not available at most places. Avocado is usually an up charge at most places too but not at Bento so definitely a plus. The price per bowl is a little more though. The service was good. The staff was friendly. I think I would come back for more poke bowl.
3/6/2022,5,"Love coming to bentos, definitely one of my favorite places. The wait time is never too crazy and the staff is always nice. You can never go wrong with any of their bowls or their boba!"
9/9/2022,5,"Very nice! The workers were attentive and friendly. Good selection of food options and portion size was decent. I got the yellow curry, not spicy. We would come back for sure!"
10/23/2022,4,"Ordered through Grubhub for delivery at the Hard Rock hotel. Order arrived timely, correct and the food was tasty! Pao Pao chicken was wonderful! Delivery was smooth (gave instructions to meet at the round about in front of the hotel). Highly recommend for resort delivery!"
2/10/2022,4,"Great place to eat Japanese food. I ate the Orange Chicken which was sweet and definitely delicious. The pork dumplings were sautéed perfectly. I would definitely recommend coming here for a great, quick bite to eat."
12/4/2022,3,Food was good but a little too salty. I got the Mongolian chicken and Shrimp and there was barely any chicken. Portions could be a bit better. The rolls were great though!
11/6/2022,1,"That's the second time I visited this place, same issue, Horrible customer service and expensive."
6/18/2022,5,"Great little sushi and Japanese restaurant They take your order off  the menu when you walk in and give you a number to put your at table and deliver it to youThe line was long when I walked in but moved along very quickly I ordered the sushi bento box, ginger salad and miso soupEverything came out fairly quickly even though they were crowded Everything was excellent. Sushi was fresh and soup and salad were great Servers were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean Great experience and excellent food Would definitely go back"
2/28/2022,4,"This is my go to quick service sushi spot. I'm in love with the Florida roll because you get salmon and tuna, avocado and cc. All my favorite ingredients. I also love the garlic string beans. It's a nice compliment to sushi because it's really crunchy and seasoned. Perfect balance. The staff is always friendly and the food never takes that long. Lots of tables inside and booths clean as well. I love coming here. It's a casual atmosphere but it's also a great spot if you want to come here with family and friends. I also love that they service Boba tea here! I find myself coming here about 2-3 times a month to get my sushi craving covered. Highly recommend. Never had a bad meal here. It's not high quality sushi but you get what you pay for. It's worth it."
9/26/2021,5,"I ordered takeout from this restaurant for dinner. I ordered the miami roll, steamed pork dumplings, and miso soup. I enjoyed all of the food. It was still hot when I received my order and the sushi was very fresh. I would recommend this place for sushi and more."
1/27/2022,5,I love this place so much. How can you not when they have spicy pao pao. The service is fast and efficient. Every staff is always so kind and helpful. I enjoy everything on the menu. Their bento box is cost efficient and a great deal of food.
7/9/2021,5,"This has to be my favorite asian fusion restaurant in Orlando! My husband was raving about Bento and we finally went on a Friday night around 6 PM so I could try it out. The restaurant decor is modern and hip. You pick up a menu, pay at the counter, and then find a place to sit. As a vegetarian, I had tons of options to choose from. I decided to do the Tofu bento box, you can choose from white or brown rice, and then pick your main entre. I decided on the veggie stir fry that would come with the protein of my choice, Tofu! We also did the avocado sushi rolls. My husband ordered the coffee boba tea which he  loved. After we paid, they give you a number stand and you can then place it on the table you sit at. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, it came out within 10 minutes. My tofu stir fry was delish! The tofu was flavored perfectly and the garlic sauce that coats it was so flavorful. The bento box also comes with salad, lo mein noodles, and veggies. The avocado sushi rolls were equally good and everything just tasted fresh. The only negative is that it is pricy but well worth it. Overall, I'm surprised by the 3.5 star rating. This is a solid restuarant and I'd be back to try more of their offerings!"
8/9/2021,1,"This was the worst sushi place I've ever ate at. It reminded me of hospital food. The tofu was like eating a kitchen sponge. The food quality in my opinion is terrible.** I received a reply from this place asking if I would email them what menu items I had so they could verify if their recipe was being followed so they could make my next visit great?????? Not sure if it was an automatic response but the store owner should consider sending some unknown patrons in to order and investigate this themselves. At this point, I don't recall exactly what we ate, ( other than the tofu was God awful, but would never try it again. I don't get to eat tofu out all that often so when I do, I'm super happy but this was the worst tofu I ever had."
1/29/2022,1,"We're a party of three who ordered through ubereats. 2 of us received orders a bit different than ordered. Mine was meant to be a chicken and tofu paopao with added bok choy but I received a tofu teriyaki (the sauce was v sweet and had sesame seeds in it) and my cousin ordered a gochujang bento but what she received definitely wasn't gochujang. The poke bowl (although the pic is blurry) was exactly as ordered. The bentos were good! We were never going to complain, however as I was eating the broccoli from my main dish I felt something hard. I assumed maybe it was a bone or something and spit it out to inspect it but it was a literal piece of metal . I'm in shock. I've never had this happen before! It's a piece of almost gold or copper colored metal. Looks like it chipped off of something (I don't have metal dentistry at all so not from me). That definitely tipped me into mildly annoyed to completely upset. That's a safety issue!"
2/22/2022,4,"Bento is always a solid, reliable option for sushi in our house! Prices are reasonable, sushi is decent, but nothing out of this world amazing. I love the poke bowls, and usually get the 'small' or 'child' portion - it's only a little smaller with only one protein option, but still 5 toppings! They also have a decent happy hour with BOGO beer Monday - Friday 4-7. They no longer have servers so everything is order at the counter, seat yourself, and then they bring out your food. Sushi's never the fastest food, but Bento is pretty good on timing unless they are super busy, so you're never waiting more than 20 mins. Overall, it's a great place for decent, quick sushi!"
5/19/2021,2,"So far yikes. Not rude or anything but not very friendly staff. They gave me tuna instead of salmon in my poke bowl. When I asked her about it she just said no that's tuna and grab the ball and dumped it in the trash. She turned around and I saw her go to the cashier and was not nice to him. All she had to do was say no that's not tuna and add some salmon. I wasn't blaming her nor was I rude. I've been to other locations and I've never had any problems so the order being wrong wasn't a big deal. It was the way it was handled. Anyway. Place is very clean and the food is always fresh. Food is always so good. Today is my birthday so I'm gonna be nice and keep a 4 star because everything is all good here.Wait Nevermind.... not even an I'm sorry and when I got the replacement it was wrong again.The table next to me got refunded on 2 items, a visit from the manager and they actually asked them if they needed anything else.  Lol. Well yes sir I did but not anymore."
1/5/2022,3,The entree was of decent size. We ordered for delivery. I liked that the bento came with a lot of sides. The taste was ok. Nothing special. Sushi was ok as well. A bit pricey for the taste in my opinion
7/24/2022,5,I always receive friendly & expert service at Goldsmith's.  This is where I take my jewelry to be repaired or created.
7/18/2020,5,"Bento is one of my favorite semi fast food restaurants. The food is good quality, they  have a variety of options, and you cant beat it for the value. They are currently only offering take out, but they have outside tables so we were able to order and sit outside. Grub hub and uner eats also offer deliver. The line outside waslong, but our food only took 20 min and our order was perfect and packaged well. They have so much to choose from; bowls, sushi, and bento boxes. We ordered two bento boxes: the monogolian steak box and a  Sriracha garlic chicken box, and also ordered the caliente sushi. The monogolian steak was cooked well, packed with flavor and quite filling. My  Sriracha  chicken was spicy, but the spice wasn't overwhelming. The caliente roll was filled with crab, jalepeno, and topped with yellowtail tuna- we enjoyed it. Sad that we couldnt dine in, but glad we came."
5/14/2021,5,"First time eating and dining in at this location. Food was great, service was alright, and the seating is kind of funky. Compared to the location on University, this location is mediocre. Told the cashier that I had a seafood allergy and he told me that they cannot guarantee cross contamination."
7/16/2022,5,i love this place. i get the build your own poke bowl and it is soooo so good. last time i went i had the jasmine milk tea and it was amazing. allof the food i have seen people get looks delicious as well. this place is very vegetarian friendly. they give you a lot of food in your bowl. i had enough to take home for lunch the next day and it was still good as leftovers!
6/8/2022,1,Not Japanese food.  Americanized to the point I could really recognize the dishes.  The red curry over rice?  Rice was not prepared properly and there wasn't enough curry.  The Pad Thai was terrible.  No nigiri sushi only rolls with odd ingredients like cream cheese.  If you are expecting good Asian food.  This is not the place to go.
3/14/2022,3,"It's a shame that I have to write this, but I feel it is my duty to make others aware that there is a possibility that the quality of the food at this location may not be up to par. On Saturday, 12MAR22, I ordered a Build-Your-Own Poké Bowl through GrubHub. I ordered salad as my base, with the addition of the soy tuna and fried tofu as my proteins. I added asparagus, edamame, and cucumbers along with tempura flakes and Furikake. As I was eating my meal, every few bites something tasted ""off""-- I was thinking maybe it was just me since not every single bite was unappealing. I get to the bottom of the bowl, and unfortunately, I found a bug. It was laying there, legs and all for me to see. I was immediately grossed out and called GrubHub. I explained that I did not expect a full refund since I *did* happen to eat to the bottom of the bowl, however, I did feel that I was due some sort of compensation for finding a bug in my food. GrubHub handled the situation swiftly and with professionalism. It was two of my dear friends who suggested that I post this review along with the photo proof so that other patrons can make a fully informed decision as to ordering the poké bowl at this restaurant. To clarify; I'm only discouraging other customers from ordering a poké bowl, as there might not be a quality issue with their other food offerings."
4/11/2020,5,"I absolutely love Bento. There's a little something for everyone. There's sushi, poke bowls, bento boxes, and bowls. I regularly eat here for dine or takeout.One of my favorite dishes is the garlic Sriracha (I usually get it with chicken). It has such a yummy flavor that's a bit on the spicy side, so be careful if you don't like spice.The poke bowls are great. You can choose from a couple of predetermined combos, but I find it so much more fun to build your own. The staff has always been super friendly when I've come in whether it be for dine in or takeout. Definitely keep an eye on their social media accounts for any specials or deals they run."
1/12/2021,5,Very classy establishment friendly attentive staff. Good food reasonably priced. Phoned order in had to wait its very busy and Being a little early
5/27/2022,1,"Slow, confused, unstaffed restaurant.  Their work stations are filthy with food on the floor, uncovered food sitting out in the open for long periods of time. Many people waiting for orders much longer than told initially. Don't bother. A waste of time."
2/8/2020,5,"As much as I prefer ""mom and pop"" shops and small vendors, I must say I am impressed by Bento's service. I was planning an event a month im advance with an up-and-coming sushi chef who then never emailed me an invoice or menu, then I began to plan with a mom and pop sushi restaurant which I personally recommend - and they informed me two days before my event they can no longer cater nor deliver. Luckily there's Google and I found a vendor called ezcater which took me to Bento. I've dinned at Bento's plenty of times but I was looking to order sashimi which I know they don't have... But here I was a two days before my event and I just needed some sushi! I encountered issues with delivery time and Bento's opening time via ezcater... but luckily I came in contact with Jade Pham- Catering Manager for Bentos and Less than 24 hours before my event of 20, Jade was able to accommodate an early pick up!The order was on time, included all utensils, was visually appealing, everyone raved about the taste, and the portions were just as noted on their catering menu.Thank you Jade and the Bento team!"
7/10/2021,5,"The cream chicken spicy on udon noodles is a home run if you're hungry but don't know what to order. I haven't had their sushi but from what I saw on the surrounding tables, it was a grand slam"
3/3/2022,5,Great spot for fast and easy poke bowls. With the quality of a sit down restaurant in five minutes. Very happy we found this place so we could get back to exploring the area.
5/22/2021,5,This place never disappoints! I often get the bamboo roll which I love but the other day I decided to get the veggie stir fry bento box and that was a home run! The family loves coming here as it is always reliable and of great quality.
8/14/2022,2,"This place went down hill after Covid. I used to come here all the time but I'll never come back. They changed the menu and have so many limitations. I ordered a simple bento box that took almost 30 minutes to come out because they prioritized the to-go orders. They have terryaki and steak but you can't get them together anymore, makes sense. They changed the wonton chips to basic regular Chinese food wontons with no flavor and no longer serve the dipping sauce which was the best part of coming here."
12/6/2019,4,"Good spot for lunch! They have a happy hour special where you buy 2 rolls and you get a classic roll for free. I haven't tried their sushi yet but it does look tasty. It does seem like they can get backed up during peak lunch and dinner hours.However, their thai pineapple fried rice is a must have! I get it with steak and shrimp for an extra 3.00$. So worth it! The past couple days I've also tried their udon shrimp tempura soup, shrimp pad Thai, and fried pork dumplings! All very tasty dishes!! The tables and soda station can use a little more attention but overall clean dining room as well!"
2/17/2022,5,"Overall meals are prepared well and pickup time is always fast! Great service and one time they messed up my order and the manager was very nice and gave me a gift card to come back, so I feel like the management cares about their customers and take pride in doing things right."
6/21/2020,5,"Ah Bento, how I love thee. First things first, check-in! I got a deal on the Yelp app that said ""one free appetizer with a $10 purchase."" I got my usual lo mein noodle bowl with Pao Pao Spicy Cream chicken and as my free appetizer I got the krab wontons which were fried amazingly but the dipping sauce was not that amazing.My noodles tasted phenomenal, they also udon or ramen noodle options, and the spicy chicken has the perfect amount of sweet and spicy mix. It does have veggies included in the dish such as sweet peppers so if you don't like it I would said opt out. Though I did not get it this time, their mongolian beef with rice bowl with white rice is another amazing option as well as their general tso chicken with any rice or noodle option! Sometimes, I get the spicy cream chicken bento box which is pretty filling and offers great variety if you don't want to settle for just rice or noodles."
8/4/2022,5,Always great quality food & quickly prepared . Never had an issue with my orders . I can always count on this location when I'm looking for a quick well rounded meal.
7/18/2022,1,I ordered Togo and got food poisoning... the food was great but the aftermath wasn't.
5/20/2020,4,"I ordered to go from Bento last night and had an excellent meal. Ordering was easy on Postmates. I decided to try the General Tso's Chicken with Fried Rice and an Egg Roll. I ordered and left my house, it took 30 minutes to get there and food was ready when I arrived. I asked if they had a spicy mustard and they did not.  The only hot sauce option was a spicy mayo. I like using it on my egg roll.  Everything else was perfect in the bag.  I drove home and opened it. It was still hot! I love it when I food is packed well and stays hot. The egg roll was more than I expected. It was an orderOf two and they were cut in half.  These could have been packed better. The plastic clamshell didn't not keep these warm.  I heated them in the oven and they were good.  I wish I had some hot mustard though. The chili soy sauce was ok.  The Fried Rice was worth the upgrade it was delicious. It had a lot of great flavor and veggies.  There was a good size portion and it paired well.  Now onto the General Tso's.  It had a nice flavor but lacked the most important part, heat.  There was no red pepper or hot flavor with it.  They did give you a good amount of broccoli for veggies.  Overall it was a great meal that could have been improved with a better packaging for the egg roll, a hot sauce option, and some heat on the General Tso's. I will definitely be going back and look forward to trying some other dishes."
3/3/2021,1,"My boyfriend decided to order a poke bowl after his grueling 12 hour shift today. He was raving about how good it was until I heard him pause and a look of horror came on to his face. He then proceeded to pull out a screw from his mouth. There was a full blown SCREW in his poke bowl. How this could even happen is beyond me. I've never seen this before. He literally could have died if he ingested this. I don't know how careless a restaurant has to be to accidentally mix in a large metal object into their food, but this place is doing it. Do not order from here. We are both traumatized and I hope this does not happen to anyone else."
11/14/2021,1,"Very disappointing experience!!! Because American Social was to busy next for we decided we would give Bento a try, and really disappointed we did. The same amount of time we would have waited at AS we waited the same amount of time to only have our order lost. With very patrons in the restaurant we still had to wait 30 minutes for food that didn't even taste good. In fact, our chicken was undercooked so after all the waiting we just threw it away along with the money we spent."
6/6/2019,3,"I've had bento here at this location several times, as it's a pretty good place to stop and get some food with friends after doing an activity in the area. Yesterday I ordered their vegetable stir fry bento box with chicken and white rice. My husband ordered the pow pow chicken rice bowl. His pow pow chicken was delicious (probably the best thing I have tried here), and my vegetable stir fry chicken was pretty decent too. Even though I have been here several times, I have yet to have a ""favorite"" meal because I am never ""in love"" with what I eat. The food is good, but never really all that great, however the pow pow chicken may have changed that. Out of ordering a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box, I usually go for the bento box style, as I like the variety of having the rice, noodles, ginger salad, green beans and little wonton dessert, along with your main protein choice. I have had their boba tea before and hated it, as there were still large chunks of ice left it in and it was not blended smoothly at all. Plus the flavor was far too artificial tasting that I just said I would never order another one again."
2/19/2020,4,"Great spot for lunch! Prices are totally reasonable, food was delicious, staff was conscientious. I had the TNT roll with the salad. Came with ginger dressing as advertised and was exactly what was expected. No disappointment here. I really enjoyed the TNT roll, the seared tuna was delicious. The people I went with all ordered different things and everyone enjoyed their meal, but that is as much as I can offer because I didn't try anyone else's food. I am looking forward to my next visit and would absolutely recommend this place!"
1/7/2019,4,"I've heard mixed reviews about this Bento location but after trying it out, I would definitely come back. Eating Bento 4 years straight during my UF days, I know their menu pretty well. This however is the first Bento location I've been to where you don't order first and then sit while a foodrunner brings you your food. This is much more formal as a dine-in restaurant. With that, there comes wait times.Walking in, I had a 25 minute wait for a party of 5 on a Saturday night. Then, we had to wait for our server to bring us our drinks. We had to wait for our server to take our orders. Wait for the food. I didn't like this style as I'm much accustomed to the fast paced Bento the other locations practice. Anything I needed, I needed to wait for the server.All our food came out delicious though. There was only 1 person in our party who mentioned that their chicken was cold. I ordered nigiri sushi. You get 2 pieces of nigiri for $4.50. I tried their salmon, shrimp and eel. They were fairly large but fresh and tasty. I also ordered the udon noodle soup. A favorite of mine. They had provided it with 4 pieces of shrimp tempura on the side. The shrimps were not the large shrimp tempuras but smaller pieces which I liked. My son ordered the kids bento box and it came with string beans, lo mein, his chicken teriyaki and a wonton chips dessert. It was a great deal for the price of $7. The restaurant was clean and the service was great. Our waitress was very friendly."
2/25/2020,4,"Popped in for a quick lunch with my husband and took advantage of the sushi promotion. Monday - Friday from 3pm - 6pm you can enjoy buy 2 get 1 sushi rolls. We went with the TNT roll and the crunch roll and selected the rainbow roll for our free roll.  They also had a bogo beer promotion so we split 2 Sapporo's. Our total came to $31 with tip which is a steal.The rainbow roll was the run of the mill classic but the fish tasted really fresh. The TNT roll came apart immediately when we tried to eat it but the flavor profiles made up for the lack of stability. The star of the show was the crunch roll. It was crispy, fresh and delicious! I would definitely order again.4 stars for a quick service sushi spot that leaves you feeling full and satisfied."
4/7/2020,5,"I absolutely love this place. This place has amazing selections that are not expensive and you can also make bento boxes. They also have Boba tea which is my absolute favorite drink! They have really good lunch specials as well. I believe they also offer a theme park employee discount as well. They are located near universal, and downtown Orlando. It's a great place to try new Asian dishes you haven't tried before."
3/10/2019,4,"Mmmm love this place. So glad they came to open up Bento restaurants in Orlando. When I was in college in Gainesville, I would eat here 2 or 3 times a week!Favorites:1) Curry Pork Katsu over rice2) Salmon & Eel sushi don3) Spicy Cream ChickenThe Food: by no means is it fancy or super authentic, but it tastes good and usually hits the spot for me. Good sized portions.The Space: there's a large amount of room for parties of all sizes. Today we came as a group of 8 and they sat us right away.The Service: friendly workers, helpful with orders and bringing out the food. Usually you go to the counter and order your food. However, some days or times of the day they change it to a sit down and order it from the wait staff.Worth it? Yes, for Asian fusion food, this is a staple for me when I'm back in Orlando."
9/28/2019,3,"It's been a while since I have been to Bento, and I was a bit disappointed in my recent visit.  Service seems to have taken the biggest hit recently - it just seems like there isn't anyone who is acting as a manager.   Lines are long and they seem to be only focused on to-go orders, they can't really explain the ordering process or menu, no please or thank you, chaos when delivering food, etc.  The food itself is now just ""ok"".  Very greasy, fatty, weird flavor, etc.  Not sure I will go back."
12/7/2021,1,"Horrible experiences. Three times in a row they charged me for ""extras"" that they claim they were out of (after the fact), but never advised us of same either when ordering or picking up. AND STILL CHARGED US THE EXTRA MONEY. THREE TIMES IN A ROW. We will NEVER give them another dime of our business and advise that you don't waste your money on them, either. What a shame. They used to be good. Now, they don't even try."
6/7/2018,4,"Came to Bento because of a local friend's high recommendation and it did not disappoint! The Bento Box is the only way to go here, hands down! I got the creamy garlic shrimp (which don't let the sauce name fool you, it is more of a garlic citrus than anything else) bento and was floored w/how much you get for $11!? Also, be sure to use your check-in offer for a free app. The fried dumplings are where it's at over  the steamed #trust. I also got their house cold sake & a Sapporo for a quasi-makeshift sake bomb and both were very reasonably priced. The atmo is good as is the service. When we walked in the place was practically empty, but it filled up fairly quickly, but our waiter was on top of it and our drinks/food came out so fast!Would def recommend and I will def be back next time I visit Orlando!"
12/7/2021,1,"unfortunately we had a horrible experience at bento asian kitchen in dr phillips, orlando! it was an internet/pick-up order. one of the dishes was supposed to have extra boc choy, which they charge for, but were out of. there was also supposed to be extra bean sprouts, but they didn't put any. this is the third time this restaurant has failed us! we should have trusted our better judgement, but didn't. the manager ""echo"" (claims is her real name) was not at all apologetic! she offered to refund the one meal, but had no concern about the lack of attempting to contact us to advise they were out of ingredients! yet they had no problem charging for the missing/neglected ingredients. we are contacting corporate to advise of our complete dissatisfying treatment. our tecommendation is eat taco bell before choosing bento asian kitchen!!!"
4/1/2018,4,"Yum yum yum! Sushi! I really like the sushi here. I had their signature dynamite roll and it was very fresh and flavorful. My friends had the bento box and I helped them finish their plates, and their chicken was so delicious. I didn't like that we all didn't get our food at the same time but they were busy... but still! Although they were busy, you can tell the staff was on it to ensure a great dining experience. Oh and the pork roll as an appetizer... wow! That was delicious! And they have eel sauce! Done. Sigh, I wanna go back!"
3/16/2021,3,such great amazing food!! always so yummy! however it feels like staff doesn't want to be interacting with customers and is kind of rude at times. I do recommend eating there
10/10/2018,5,"Best bento  food in town. Never disappointed with the food every time visit. Tonight is Saturday and the place is packed even on the rainy day. The staff is friendly and it took a little bit longer for the food to get to the table, but the food are still very delicious. We order Szechuan beef noodles,udon stir fry Chicken, I would give it a 5 star review for making the food so delicious and it makes me feel like I could eat that all over again.If you are near these places Gainesville Jacksonville Orlando and soon Winter Park be sure to go to the restaurant to see what you've been missing and whenever you have the craving for delicious food bento  is the place to go so be happy to enjoy it's delicious and wonderful contentsOur waitress is extremely friendly and when we asked for more rice, she brings it to the table with no problem. We had great dining experience!"
10/23/2018,4,"Love the new additionsWhat did I getI got the pick 2 poke bowl (Regular I believe). I got double the salmon (regular and spicy). I got it with half brown rice (didn't cost extra!) and half greens. The protein portion is surprisingly good. I asked for half and half on the base... but it was only a layer of veggies covering a big bed of brown rice. I also got 2 sauces, I am not a sauce person... But I am surprised they did not have wasabi mayonnaise... Overall it was a decent bowl of PokeEnvironmentQuite busy during lunch hours. During that time they usually have the order and then sit down and they bring you the food. In the plaza where Bar Louie is, decent amount of parking but can get busy. Once you place your order, you get a number and they bring you the food. There is also utensils and fountain machine to help yourself.Niceness of the staffThe line went pretty quick. The staff that brought out the food was really nice and offered to bring anything else neededDollarI thought the poke was quite pricey. The 2 poke was for $11. They do have a mini bowl with one poke and that is for $9.Yes?I have always been a fan of their for years, getting the noodle or rice bowls. The poke addition is great! Just need to add more greens in the half and half pokes.#WendyWanders"
2/25/2022,4,"Ate here a couple of times, food is amazing, pretty good portion and they also have boba which is amazing and it was really good too I literally have nothing bad to say, the service was great also."
10/16/2020,5,The server Spencer... Best customer service I have had. Verbatim. Can't explain how much he helped. ABOVE and BEYOND his duties.Can't push this enough. The meal? 8/10. Spencer's help? 11/10.
1/24/2018,3,"I don't usually check in to this Bentos, it is by my job and I honestly forget. I order from here frequently...sometimes sushi, but mostly the Pad Thai or something similar.For a chain restaurant, they are decent, however I must PROTEST their change in spring rolls. They used to be good and bigger...now they are SMALL and always look over fried to me. This is very disappointing. I don't know if they changed distributors or what, but it was a BAD choice. They need to go back to what was already good. As they say, if it ain't broke, DON'T fix it!That is why they are getting 2 stars.Will I still eat here...YES... I love Asian food and sushi, but watch what you order.UPDATE:::: added another star for their Boba Drink Selections. Various flavors and add-ins.Worth a try!!!!!"
10/19/2017,4,"Came by for lunch with a friend and was a bit taken back, I normally love bento cafe but this is the third time I've come in and they deliver one meal and forget to bring the other person's meal. For starters we ordered edamame and for my lunch I ordered SZECHUAN BEEF NOODLE SOUP my friend ordered sushi that looked amazing by the way. Our appetizer came out instantaneously so which was a plus, my meal came out and then we had to wait for 15 minutes for my friends sushi, now I was brought up not to eat in front of someone if they're not eating so I opted to wait. By the time his sushi came out my soup was cold. I tried to speak to the people bringing the food out to see if they would be able to give me an idea but no one stopped as I tried to get their attention so I just gave up. Overall, the young man taking my order was very sweet. The food was good but the rest, we'll have to try again...."
7/10/2020,3,"Bento is one of those fast-casual chains that gets a lottttt of stuff right. You cant really walk into the place and complain about the service, the portions, or especially the prices. I personally love the customizable nature that their menu offers, such as the option to grab only half a roll of sushi for $4 instead of spending the whole $8 and wasting food. Plus the Bento boxes are a good value! But, every time I go, I'm struck by how unmemorable the food is, specifically the sushi. It's bland--kinda feels like airport sushi sometimes. If you're looking for run-of-the-mill, American-style sushi, this is the place to go. Heck, I know at the very least my stomach is filled when I visit bc the portions are again very substantial. But the sushi gets more bland every time I come. HOWEVER, upon posting this review the first time, the business owner replied and told me that they do in fact serve nigiri and sashimi, both options I was unaware of until the business owner of this particular restaurant made it clear they offer both selections on a ""secret menu."" So I will deeeefinitely be back to try those, and hopefully they will be good!I will say, when we went to this particular Bento, the staff was very friendly, got our food to us in as timely a manner as possible at lunch rush, and everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. I guess i just need to start ordering the pad thai."
9/21/2020,4,This was pretty good. I order online and picked it up. They only issue is I order right when they open and it stated it wouldn't be ready until 45 min. Which was strange. I waited only to find out it been ready way before that.
5/2/2020,5,Probably my favorite local Asian flair food! I 100% recommend their sushi as the price is so legit as well as I recommend the orange chicken on Udon and of course the spring rolls! The husband enjoys any of their tofu options. Love that they deliver during this time for when we crave it but what to maintain our quarantine.
9/16/2019,2,"This place has gone down the trash. The dining room is filthy and no one to clean. There's maybe 5 tables sitting. It's 3:15 on a Monday so it's after the lunch rush. Employees just hanging out chatting. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location again. I used to recommend Bentos to everyone, but no more. I'm in the hospitality industry and I will not be telling my guests staying at my hotel to come here again. I try over and over agin to give it another chance but no more. Downtown Bento will be the place I go to from now on."
6/20/2021,5,"One of our favorite chains since we discovered it in Gainesville 10+ years ago.  There is a chain back home in South Florida (Davie location), but we still get takeout here at least two times when we visit Orlando.Food is always great - we love the noodle bowls and Pao Pao chicken the most.The sushi combo is great as well - 2 half rolls and a California Roll.  Online order system does have issues once in a while, but convenient when it works.  Or just call ahead your order.Also, they have specials often, so make sure to check out their social media/emails for them."
12/31/2021,1,"I loved this restaurant for many years, but they stopped accommodating special requests. I've been ordering my chicken tempura rolls with avocado added for well over 3 years. Now they can't accommodate the request even though I pay extra every time happily! The manager even refused to cancel my order even though my request couldn't be honored. Literally ordered this week from them and had no issues but tonight with the customer service I won't be back. If you don't want to be bothered with a phone call with special requests maybe just add modifications to the menu options online then."
10/20/2020,4,"Bento is doing pick up services well during the pandemic. I've been a frequent customer of Bento. Some of my frequent picks are: taro bubble tea with pearls, shrimp tempura, Special Mexican roll and Pao Pao shrimp with Udon. -the pao pao shrimp with Udon can be quite heavy at times -the Special Mexican Roll is an Americanized sushi roll, with avocado and tempura shrimp -taro tea is good, though can be on the sweet side -have had the Thai tea and found it too sweet at timesThis place has easily become a community favorite and has been a family favorite for years. It might not be my go to place, though it caters to different tastes which makes it easy to enjoy."
8/15/2020,5,"We LOVE Bento! The amount of food you get for the price you pay is top notch. Great bang for your buck and quality food. Easy, quick and delicious!"
3/27/2018,3,"My coworkers and I were looking for something different for lunch today and decided to give Bento Cafe a try. We arrived a little after 12 and the restaurant was nearly empty. For lunch, I ordered a bowl with brown rice and Mongolian chicken. I also added miso soup. My food was served promptly. The miso soup was good, but the Mongolian chicken was super salty. Unfortunately my coworkers did not have as much luck with their meals being served promptly. 2/4 of us were served food 15 minutes after the rest of the party. Half of us were done eating before the others even got served. It was a little bit confusing since there were hardly any other patrons in the restaurant. Overall, I'd say my experience was average. I probably wouldn't return."
1/25/2022,2,"My son wanted to come here. The food was good....HOWEVER...Although my food came out first within 5 mins,  my son had to wait 30 MINUTES for his food because they forgot him! We went up to the counter twice to remind them and they would just say ok and still no food.. they were not understaffed and the place was not jammed pack... they even forgot the extra sauce I had to pay for and when my son's food finally came out there was no apology or reason given to why his food was served to him 30 minutes after ordering.. My son who is a server himself in 2 high end restaurants was disappointed on the service... We won't come here again. What a shame, the food was tasty"
6/18/2021,1,"Poor online order  management.. They missed the online order I placed.some one says they made incorrect order and prepared new again. No good order management. Handed over the food close to an hour after placing the order. No courtesy at all for causing the delay highlighting their delivery time can take up to an hour and saying they still met their delivery within window, very poor."
4/30/2017,5,"Bento Cafe was a spot my daughter likes so we popped in earlier today. What can I say, my daughter has excellent taste.  Even though its walk up Ordering off a laminated card, there is a touch of class to the place. The ambiance definitely gives it a vibe that is more than just a fast food experience. And the food was above that expectation as well. We got a rice with chicken bowl and a red curry shrimp with noodles, respectively.  Both were killer good.  Ad the accompanying egg rolls were top notch, fresh.  The boba teas we got were strawberry and I got a Matcha(just to be different).  They were solid.  The strawberry tasted like the milk left behind a bowl of fruit loops, but I think that's what they were going for.  We had no issues. The service was even good, with our guys giving good suggestions on what to get. Next time my daughter wants Bento, I will not hesitate to go."
9/27/2020,1,"I get it's Covid season, but you have one person managing the whole dining area and carry out orders? Ordered online 1hr before I picked it up and then waited another 45 min to be handed my bag of food that was just sitting on the shelf the whole time. Paid a $20 tip ahead of time which I regretted. Not mad at the poor guy managing the whole place, but whoever manages this place and thinks that is feasible for one person to manage the whole store when you have 10 people in the kitchen area should be fired. Also several items missing when I got home, sooo disappointing. So basically got robbed of time and money."
11/22/2017,4,"This establishment offers a great value, especially on restaurant row. The Service was excellent, the food was great and the portion size was more than adequate.  Plus the menu has tons of options.Update: November 22,2017- we continue to  eat here once every couple weeks.  The service has been a bit slow as of recent, especially when waiting to be seated.  The food continues to be reliably good. The variety is great, you could eat here weekly and not worry about eating the same thing repeatedly.  I have eastern numerous of the chicken dishes either as part of a bento bowl or a udon noodle bowl.  You can sub brown rice in the sushi or rice bowls for no additional charge.  The only thing I have had that I wouldn't order again was the pad Thai; it's just not the same flavor profile as a standard Thai restaurant."
6/9/2019,5,"I love going there for the sushi bento box mainly. I think it is a great price for the amount of sushi they give you. The fried avocado is the absolute best!!!! Love the little salad that comes with the sushi, the dressing is really good! Keep an eye on yelp as they have one free appetizer with an entree of $10 or more so we got dumplings which was crispy and yummy! Order in advance if you want it to go to avoid waiting quite a long time!"
1/12/2020,4,"This location introduced me to the bento chain. I've always had a good experience here! I recently visited with some friends from out of the country to introduce them to decently priced asian food, sushi and boba tea. The girl at the counter taking orders was nice and addressed any questions they had very well. We ordered , took our number and waited at the table for our food which came out very quickly and the young man who delivered was very kind and helpful. Overall, I loved this location but it gets busy and they should have more than one person taking orders when the line gets very long."
7/13/2020,4,"My friends love Bento, we usually order it thru food delivery services and I think it's okay. I ordered a bento box, which was a decent sized lunch portion. It came with a little salad (dressing they put on top was good,) some noodles, and a 4 piece of the 2 rolls you pick, and then a California roll. Like i said, it was good - and the presentation was good, Bento box is definitely the way to go for lunch. I love the rolls that have raw fish piled on top so I think I was thinking the signature rolls would be more of that when I was reading the menu... something more dense. But I'm definitely going to be more adventurous next time and order a full signature roll to try out something new. I will be trying again."
11/21/2018,3,"There was no salad or boba tea available on 11/20/2018 :( I've never been to Bento so this was a sad thing to know coming in. Our server for the night was Jonathan. Very sweet, kind and patient! His service was outstanding. Always checking on my party of two. 5 stars for service. We came in so hungry! We ordered dragon, kawaii, philly and another roll I cannot remember. The food was only okay. A simple ""meh."" I didn't really like their selection on the menu. I think I'm more used to seeing more options and sashimi available. I don't think I'll be back soon but it's worth a try to anyone else out there! Don't knock it till you try it. Unfortunately, I'm knockin this one out."
2/25/2020,4,"Bento is the chipotle of sushi.  Always a solid choice and you won't break the bank.  Quick, fast and to the point.  Sushi was delicious.  They could however use better rice, as the one we received easily breaks apart and caused a mess... happy hour 3pm-6pm.  Buy 2 rolls and get one free, also BOGO beer.."
11/9/2018,1,"Tried to give them business, called to put in to go order. But was told they were about to close and they don't take to-go order with 20 mins before closing.  Smh"
1/6/2019,4,"I always enjoy a bento box and this one did not disappoint for the variety and amount of food provided in the box.I did the box with brown rice and katsu chicken.  It also comes with some string beans in a vinaigrette type sauce, salad with some good ginger dressing, and some lo mein noodles.  It was a lot more food than I would typically expect in a box (normally I have seen noodles or rice).Our table also shared some veggie spring rolls, pork egg rolls, and pork dumplings.   Everything came out hot, fresh, and fast.I am looking forward to coming back in for another box."
9/10/2020,5,Amazing food! Amazing service! I order my food at peak rush time (5pm) and yet they still had my food ready in less than 15 minutes. I go in to pick up my order and was treated by the nicest staff! They had SO MANY mobile orders and were extremely busy but still find the time to smile and give me great customer service.
5/8/2019,5,"Cute restaurant, staff was really friendly and explained any questions we had about the menu. Food was really good! It was our first lunch in Florida and was definitely not disappointed. I wish we had one of these locations where I was, but when we make another trip we will definitely visit this place again!"
8/6/2020,5,"I ordered delivery and it was surprisingly good. A little overpriced but I wanted to try it out. The rice bowl had too many onions and peppers and not enough meat but overall it was good. The pork egg rolls were good, I had them with the sweet chili sauce which is tasty. Milk tea had it with boba, typical milk tea, nothing special. And the kimchi was good :)"
6/26/2020,5,"We love bento!!!  We order all the time from this location, food is always great. Denice the manger is best !! I can not rave more about her we had a problem with our order and she made sure to go above and beyond to make sure it was taken care of! What a great team leader! Thank you for being so kind and professional."
7/11/2018,5,"Tammy was right - those krab wontons were a delight.  They were perfectly fried, came with a great dipping sauce, and didn't have too much cream cheese filling.  Also, this round I had the sushi 'bento' box which is great because it is easy to customize.  With our table of 4, we were all able to try different rolls - which was a perfect plan."
2/15/2019,5,"I have been here numerous times and it is one of my fave go-to restaurants due to the very relaxed atmosphere and no fuss food. There are so many options for any of my plant-based friends. Yesterday when I went however, I was blown away by their services. Yesterday was Valentine's Day and I got there around 8:00; there was no ridiculous line or wait time. It was AMAZING! It's a great place to host big dinners (I did that for my undergrad and grad school family dinner). Plus it makes a great chill date night; especially if you order the peach sake, SOOOO GOOD! PS: you must try the spicy cream at least once!!"
6/25/2020,5,"Delicious! Would order again! We ordered a Mongolian noodle bowl, a sweet and sour pineapple bowl, a crunch roll, spring rolls, and a side salad. The bowls were plentiful and lots of veggies! The order was delivered quickly and with utensils/napkins. Again, delicious!!"
3/15/2018,5,"So happy to see another Bento Cafe!!!  Coming from Gainesville, Bento was always one of my regular spots.  When I saw there was one here in Orlando (by the same owners) I had to continue the tradition.  They have a few proteins to choose from prepared a variety of different ways as well as a great sushi menu.  You can get your protein in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box that comes with various sides like rice, noodles, green beans, and a small cake.  They also offer sushi/poke bowls that are delicious! The atmosphere is always really great and the staff are super friendly.  Oh, and I could not forget the boba tea!  I always go for the Royale (coffee and almond) milk tea that I've been getting since college.  This location is just as good as the Gainesville ones and I'm glad to see they decided to expand down here."
10/27/2018,4,"A great casual restaurant for lunch and dinner. They serve sushi rolls, poke bowls and these customizable rice/noodle bowls or bento boxes. They also have thai iced teas and other boba/milk tea drinks which is always a plus for me. I've come here for both lunch and dinner. The restaurant is pretty spacious so they can accommodate groups if you have one. For lunch one time, my company came with 12 of us and they were able to get us seated pretty quickly and cater to our large party. They do get pretty packed though so there might be a slight wait at times but that's a good sign because the food is good! I usually get the bento boxes because I like a little bit of everything. It comes with a scoop of rice (you can request for brown rice at no extra charge), some Lo mein noodles, a side of string beans, a salad, and an entree of your choosing. I had the sriracha garlic shrimp and the curry katsu and both were delicious. It also comes with these fried wonton chips drizzled in condensed milk so it's a legit full meal. I also always get the jasmine milk tea because why not? It's your standard milk tea, not bad and not amazing, just good enough to satisfy your craving. My friends have ordered the sushi and  they enjoyed that too. Everyone I come with is usually pretty satisfied so I definitely recommend this place! It's a regular for most of us. The service has been good the last couple of times I've been here as well. They also do takeout orders which you can pick up at the register if you don't want to dine in the restaurant. Free parking in the lot but it gets packed sometimes since it's in a plaza with multiple restaurants."
6/10/2018,3,"3.5/5I think this place is pretty good, definitely for the price point it's up there in value. Unfortunately my table had a couple of disappointments that prevented me from giving this a 4 star.I had the build-a-poke, which came with a wide variety of choices for proteins, additions, toppings, and sauces. For $11 or something around there, the poke was excellent. The portions were huge, and the fish was high quality and good taste.To finish my meal up I had the lychee boba tea, which was also well done.Most of my friends ordered bento boxes, and their experience ranged from really good to really terrible. The katsu in particular had criticisms of it being extremely dry and hard to eat, and the ""creamy"" chicken was anything but.Service was not the best. After our orders were taken, the server never came back to us to ensure water was filled, and rarely come back overall.I'll probably consider other Japanese places next time I'm in Orlando, but wouldn't say no to returning if needed."
5/7/2020,5,"Picked up lunch today, general tso's chicken bento box,excellent choice, comes with main dish, salad lo mein and green beans.  All items were fresh and tasted great.  Excellent lunch choice"
2/5/2021,5,"We ordered the sushi combo box and an order of krab wontons to share between two of us. There was enough food and it was very tasty!  Cali, Mt. Fuji, and the Mex roll--yum! Oh, and boba tea was great!  Mango popping in slush and milk tea with lychee popping. Perfect!"
10/1/2020,1,I ordered from Bentos through Doordash. When I placed the order it said 40 min delivery time. It kept getting pushed back in 15 min. Increments by the restaurant until it was 2 hours late. Doordash offered to comp the meal and provide a credit. It was supposed to be 10 more min. So that seemed fair. After 3 hours I called Doordash and they called Bentos for a status update. Bentos said they can't complete the order because they were getting ready to close.  So 3 hour delay and no food. I am really disappointed in the poor customer service.
9/25/2018,1,"This place isn't as good as 4 years ago. I've been going to Bentos for 8 years now, and these past few times have been disappointing. Today I gave it one more shot, and I'm done. I won't be coming here, and many of my close friends who were regulars have stopped going for months now. The food isn't good (it's extremely unhealthy and heavy), I actually had an upset stomach right after. The service has gone down; the waitress I had today was SO RUDE, and hard to communicate with. It's as if she went out of their way to be rude to a random person. Who does that?!The prices have gone up but the experience has gone down. There is no longer silverware (forks and knives), no lemons for your water and the food was presented just ok."
6/17/2019,1,"Vegans Beware!!!I have never in my life been to a less vegan-friendly Asian restaurant chain!!! First, they don't even have a comprehensive allergen guide since it doesn't contain anything about dairy allergies; second, the guide they do have is kept behind the counter where customers can't see and is not available on the website at all; third, the staff are completely ignorant about what ingredients go into the food they're serving.It was actually impossible for me to find out the ingredients for several of their sauces ""because the kitchen manager wasn't there"" right then. I was told their orange sauce (?!) and many of their other sauces weren't vegetarian because they contained fish sauce, and was shown the actual packaging for the base for ALL their curries which has DAIRY in it -- so all the people who have posted saying that their curry is vegan have either been LIED TO or have asked employees who just don't care enough to check.Out of their 20+ sauce options, the staff was only able to verify 3 as vegan, 2 of which were too spicy for my family. And one of the employees actually said that lots of ""authentic"" Asian sauces contained fish sauce -- you know what authentic Thai curry does NOT include? DAIRY!!! And I've never encountered an orange sauce with fish sauce in it before. I guess now I understand why they don't have their allergen menu anywhere customers can find it -- because they're ashamed of their pathetic vegan options, or if they aren't they really should be!"
12/10/2017,4,"The restaurant is located inside a strip mall, so we had a little trouble finding it  but we are glad we did. We ordered take out. Service was fast and friendly. We were unfamiliar with the menu and the cashier was patient with us. We had a poke bowl, a pad thai, and a bento box. All the food was fresh and tasted very good.  The pad thai was probably the only dish that I was a little disappointed in, since it only seemed to be loaded with noodles and not much else. We were offered water while we waited, and food was ready in an amazingly short time. Overall great experience, particularly considering this is a chain restaurant."
8/19/2018,5,"I came here based on a friend's recommendation, and I'm glad I did! We were able to be seated right away on a Sunday evening. Everything we ordered was really fresh and tasty! I will definitely be coming back!"
2/23/2020,5,"This place is a favorite of mine and go to spots, I can always try a new dish and never be disappointed. Always get a bento box and is worth the price. My favorites are the Beef Bulgogi and the Chicken Red Curry."
6/27/2019,4,"Never disappointed. It's bentos. Anything on the menu is delightful, sushi, a bento box, bowl..  plus they have so many things to toss your meats in. Wish there were more convenient locations instead on in the middle of downtown or in the middle of I drive madness. But I understand, location location location."
9/7/2018,4,"One of our go-to once a week dining spots.  Spicy tuna bowl, chicken with yellow curry bento box and Sushi...Kua'i roll is our usual order!  Oh wait...forgot the Katsu chicken and boba milk tea.  Service can be a hit or miss during peak hours. We usually order from the to-go order line and sit at the sushi bar for immediate seating. Hardly anyone sits at the sushi bar unless it's extremely busy.  Servers are consistently friendly.  With any bento box you get your choice of the main entree plus rice, noodles, ginger salad, fried green beans, wonton chips with a sweet sauce.  Yellow curry chicken was delicious!  The tuna bowl was delicious as well.  Fish was fresh and abundant.  Katsu chicken is tasty-meat tender and outside crisped. Try the Boba milk teas...there are many varieties.  Love the Jasmine, Taro and regular milk tea!  Make sure you get your boba tea frequency punch card!"
8/22/2020,3,"SO Disappointed with this once favorite quick lunch spot! Although the service was ok.... and admits the COVID restrictions, we decidedly sit dine in... the reason I leave this review is entirely the fact that they had 0 working bathrooms. When I alerted the waitress that there were SIGNS that said they were out of order. She feigned surprise, walked away for a total of 30seconds to confirm my statement. When I said ""are you serious!?"" Which is my god given human right reaction, to the fact that there is no working plumbing. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Aside from that fact that she was rude and did not offer any solutions, they continued to take orders at the door KNOWING there were absolutely NO working toilets. As a restaurant it is illegal to have dine in customers without working restrooms, and the fact that they continued to sit people regardless of the fact, that if someone wanted to use the restroom after a long day at the parks, or a long drive there, or even a preganant woman... there was nothing available, but the hope adjacent restaurants wound allow service with out being a customer. I will no longer eat at Bento, and will no longer recommend."
7/2/2018,5,"I love Bento! Visited the Dr. Phillips location (I usually go downtown since I live downtown) but the parking here is a lot easier. The service was great as always, and I love the atmosphere! You can be seated at a table or at the ""sushi bar"" and watch them put together your roll, which is pretty cool. I ordered my favorite, Special Mexican roll. I get it every time!! Great sushi spot for a reasonable price and even better quality!"
12/2/2019,5,"Wheny here on a double date with friends, the food was amazing we all got something different. Everything tasted great there was plenty of food, you could easily make two meals out of your entree.I had the yellow curry with chicken and rice, it was really delicious had great flavor had some heat but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. Definitely go back again!"
6/3/2018,5,I swear i love this place! The food is always so fresh and tasty and the people have the best customer service ever!
1/15/2018,5,"Came here for a birthday and ordered the spicy cream chicken which was pretty good. The portion size is really filling, enough to share in my opinion. Comes with green beans and red/green peppers. Also got the lychee sake was also really good! Light and refreshing. We also got a poke bowl, which was really good! It was salmon, white rice, avocado, seaweed salad and furikake. Everything was fresh anParking was readily available with plenty of space. Probably my favorite thing about our visit was our waiter, Alexander. Very thorough and just an all around nice guy that didn't have a problem getting us something when we needed. The wait isn't too bad on the weekends but can get kind of long. This location differs from the one by UCF, which is kind of in and out versus this location is more of a sit down."
12/8/2017,1,"Quality of food and service have decreased as Bento has gained popularity. My holy grail entrees have always been the Neo Tokyo Kawaii roll (tuna, krab delite, cucumber, avocado, drizzled with sweet chili sauce) which is now discontinued and the udon tofu curry katsu noodle bowl. So I allow myself one cheat meal a week and I was looking forward to my udon tofu curry katsu noodle bowl. Imagine my disappointment when the server brings out a large bowl and a few strands of udon noodles with 10 string beans. Remember this is my holy grail meal that I order every time I come here so I'm familiar with the portion sizes. I mentioned my observation to the waiter and he offered to take my bowl to the back of the kitchen and then brings it back and apologizes. For an additional charge the cooks can open and another pack of udon noodles to place in my bowl. They only use one pack of udon noodles. Mistake number one was letting the waiter take my bowl away and return it to me the ""same."" If you've worked in the restaurant industry you know what may or may not happens when a customer complains. At this point I was starving and dug into my miniscule bowl ignoring any warnings my germaphobic intuition may be alerting me.  My colleague who always reluctantly accompanies me to Bentos offers to share his food with me. He also observed the dearth in portion size compared to the previous visits. He also kindly remind me that he did not want to eat here because of his previous disappointments at this location but came at my insistence. Service is a work in process. My colleague ordered water with no ice for me. Water arrives with ice. No big deal. Ice will melt and turn into water. When ordering we requested separate checks. My colleague requested for a fork when ordering appetizers since he can't use chopsticks. His appetizers arrived and he used his hands to eat them. I get up and walk to the soda machines to get him a fork. The first fork that I fished out had  debris stuck to it. I placed it onto the counter and grabbed a second fork that looked cleaner. *cringe* After the appetizers were finished. A fork was provided to him along with our entrees. A different server comes and offers to clear the remaining plates while we were eating our entrees. She took one plate. ONE. Ignoring the several empty plates on the table.When the check came it was not separated. We asked again for separate checks to pay for our respective meals. Check came back and it was split in half evenly. Whatever. We sign the receipts and leave.Our server was very sweet and nice. He seemed new and and I wish the best for him.At this point, this was the final nail in the coffin and I'll be avoiding any future visits to this location. I left feeling so hungry from the disappointing portions."
6/9/2017,5,"Benton has been sitting in my bookmarks for too long. Mom and I finally took the leap and stopped in for lunch and I am so glad we did. I am a huge sushi fan and they have it in spades. I chose the Sushi Box which includes an 8 piece Californai Roll, then I chose a 4 piece Special Mexican Roll and a 4 piece Alaskan. If you check in on Yelp there is a great coupon you can use to get a free appetizer with any $10 purchase so we ordered the Pork Egg rolls. Mom ordered a Sesame Chicken rice bowl with brown rice and she chose a drink from the refridgerator while I chose an iced tea. After ordering we were given a number and then found a seat. Since Mom has a walker one of the servers offered to remove a chair from our table so that her walker had a space, which was very nice. We received our egg rolls first. They were crispy and flavor ful. They were served with a tasty sweet and sour sauce which I really enjoyed. When my sushi box arrived I was so excited. I didn't know where to start. So I started with the Alaskan roll. It contained krab, smoked salmon, avocado and masago. Wow, loved the smokey flavor, not what I was expecting. Already loving this place and it just uped my feelings. Now I moved onto the California, filled with krab, avocado, cucumber and masago. Pretty typical of other California rolls but the freshness of the ingredients really shined through. My final roll was the Special Mexican and was my absolute favorite. Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, steamed shrimp, spicy mayo and eel sauce. Before digging in one of the servers stopped by to check on us and he recommended I try the white sauce with my roll and so I happily agreed and I am so glad I did. This added an additional zip to the already dynamic flavor. Of the 3 rolls, this was my favorite. From beginning to end, we both loved our meals. We look forward to returning and trying more menu items. I especially look forward to try a bubble tea.Happy dining!!!"
6/7/2017,5,"I came here for the first time today, meeting up with friends for an impromptu lunch date. I was quite impressed with the location, seating and overall dining experience. Conveniently located on ""Restaurant Row"", which is West Sand Lake Road, Bento Cafe offers you a yummy sushi experience that won't break the bank. You order at the counter, pay and are given a numbered table flag. Food is delivered to your table. Menu is fairly varied, with an average of 8-10 dining options in the form of rolls, noodles, rice, poke bowls and some appetizers. Beverages are also decently varied. Boba tea is available, as are fountain drinks, some beers and Japanese sodas in the cooler, among others. Prices are good starting around $5-6 for appetizers and some of the rolls.Seating is a plenty, and there are Happy Hour specials!I say check them out. And order a Kawai Roll. You'll thank me later!!!!"
6/16/2017,1,"I used to always order from the downtown location for Bento Cafe using Uber Eats. I fell in love with the food instantly. I recently moved to this side of town and I was extremely excited to find one 15 minutes away on Sand Lake. I came with a few friends along with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I ordered about $50 worth of food and waited a considerable amount of time for it all to come out. When it came out, I wanted to request a little more soy sauce and ginger. A girl called out ""I'll be with you in a moment"" and proceeded to stand at the servers drink fill station with four other female employees while talking amongst each other while also looking at us occasionally. For five minutes. She never came back. Several different servers passed by us and also did not acknowledge our existence. After a while, we got annoyed and a server heard us talking about it and asked us what we were waiting for. I kindly asked for some soy sauce and ginger and he said sure. I then watched him go to the drink fill station and speak to the other employees that were talking. Five minutes pass and he gets up from his talk and grabs my stuff and sends me on my way. We took it to go and when we got home, I realized we had two full rolls missing from the bag. We called back and they asked if we lived nearby. We drove basically 30 minutes close to midnight for two full rolls that should've been in there in the first place. I feel that after all of this I shouldn't gotten more of a refund but nah. Nothing they could do about it, except offer 2 free rolls next visit. They brought out a binder of lists of guests who need things comped from past mistakes, and added us in.A thick binder. Unsure if I want to go back to this location and even redeem it."
7/1/2021,1,We arrived at 11:02.  Seven employees visibly present.  We ordered four sushi rolls.  As of 11:30 one roll has arrived to the table.  No plates.  No sauce.  When we approached one of the seven employees for plates and sauce we were told to ask someone else.  We will not be back.  Horrible service.  Can't tell you about the food..still haven't gotten telos remainder of our order.
6/16/2019,4,"Ordered a decent amount of food on UBER last night. Had a few people over and it was an easy solution for dinner. We had about 8 entrees some sushi and a kids meal and everything was perfect. Arrived hot, everything tasted great. Came with utensils and sauces. Definitely a great fix for an easy dinner without the hassle!"
6/1/2019,1,"Kids got food poisoning May 23rd, and several other neighbors after I started a blog.Very poorly handled by management.Filed a Fl dept of health complaint , they are investigating.Shall not go back there any time soon , eventhough we were regulars."
6/1/2020,1,"Just a quick note... togarashi (which is simply chili pepper flakes) now cost $1.00. In my opinion, that's ridiculous!!!!! Really? Just to add some spice to my edamame. I wonder if they charge for salt and pepper?"
6/4/2020,5,"My fiance and I love Bentos. Coming from South Florida, this location was amazing. Great portions, amazing food and great staff. 10/10."
4/15/2017,2,"So, I had constant debates with myself if I should write this review or not because I normally take food over service but the last time we visited this location it was pretty bad. Pretty bad that I was on the verge of leaving but I was hungry so decided to wait some more. We arrived on a Friday evening, gave us a 20 min wait for 4. We sat down in ten so was under the impression that we would get out on a reasonable time. Waiter came, brought us water, took our orders. Now the issues start. We ordered an appetizer and some sushi rolls to share, 20 min came by, still nothing. In the meantime, our server never once visited us. I had to get up and find someone to get an update on our food. Main entrees arrived like 10 min later. Noticed that two of our orders were wrong, came with lo mein noodles instead of mini udon. Runner took it back to correct it. Update, server still hasn't visited the table at all. I had to get up and get utensils for the littles ones and refill our own drinks. Finally our food came and damn they 100% jipped us on our noddles. Came with like 10 noodles and they were the wrong ones. They were the huge udon noodles not the mini. I was so hungry by this time that I didn't care to send it back. I have picture for proof. It was so sad too cause my katsu chicken was so bomb today. After we finished eating, our server decided to bless us with his presence and brought the check without us asking. Noticed they didn't take the appetizer off since I used the check-in offer from Yelp. Told a server, not ours, cause he didn't stop by to pick it up in a timely matter. Server came back and said thanks! And returned our card. We open the checkbook to retrieve our card and leave a tip when we realize they hadn't even charged our card yet. At this point, I was completely over this experience and wanted to leave asap. Almost thought about doing a dine and dash since the server should have realized they didn't swipe our card before he said thanks. But decided against it and just went up the cashier to see if they can process our card. Go for lunch when they don't have ""servers."" This location should switch to the lunch way at night if they can't figure out how to run their business with servers."
8/21/2019,5,"Coming in not expecting to enjoy my meal, I was pleasantly surprised by the food, price, and staff. According to yelp Bento does not have very good rating so I never gave the one near UCF a try, thinking I would be disappointed. I really enjoyed my sushi here, and in comparison to other fast Asian restaurants, the sushi was very fresh and made when you order. The rice bowl my friend order was very tasty and even though it is not a fancy authentic Asian taste, you get the fast food Chinese taste you crave, but even more fresh. The portions here are very large as well, you really get what you pay for. Overall I would say that Bento is a great option if your looking for fast Asian food, but don't expect a sit down restaurant like Hawkers or Sushi pop."
5/5/2020,1,Manager did not honor the yelp check-in saying its no longer valid even though it's still active on the app-beware. The cashier James was super nice though!
6/7/2019,1,It would be nice if there was a sign that says please go to the cash register to order your meal... I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my order.Then finally asked if someone could take my order and they said  - oh you have to Order at the cashiers ... above the cashier sign it says pitcher for orders to go... So I had no idea you were supposed to stay in there to order and in Restaurants order as well.By this time there  was a very long line.I asked to speak with a manager... and no manager came.Finally one of the service came to me and I like that you just said they hang a sign up that says the order here - and walked out and went to another sushi restaurant across the street Oh well.  Not a big deal... just was a bit frustrating
2/17/2017,4,"Yuummmm, everytime I eat at Bento I think of my college days at UF. I don't think this location can ever compare to my Gainesville student struggle experience but it comes rather close with giving me the right type of spice and sushi to fulfill my bento cravings. My favorite entre is the curry katsu noodle bowl, I love the level of spiciness the sauch has and usually get extra. I also like their milk teas with boba, they have a punch card so if you drink milk tea often you'll eventually get a free one. My favorite rolls are usually all their cooked sushi options (Im kinda allergic to raw fish) they have all been satisfying.Notes-Check in on yelp and get a free appetizer if you spend more then $10.-Ask for milk tea punch card if you purchase them often.-Lunch time line is usually crazy long, enjoy during their less busy hours or order take out -Their food is filling and you get large portion sizes, I have never left feeling hungry-Enjoy!"
10/16/2020,2,"Waiting for over an hour for my ""25 min"" pickup and they forgot half my order. I understand its Friday but simply adjust pickup times to accurately reflect. Half of my order will be cold by the time I finally get the other part of my order."
4/12/2019,4,"Their taro milk tea is the brown version not purple version. I'm used to purple taro milk tea where the best way to describe it is 'the milk left after eating fruity cereal' but this brown version is more like 'the milk left after eating chocolate cereal with a mild coffee flavor'? Not fruity at all to me. It wasn't as bad as other places that I've been given the brown version, this one was still sweet, creamy and tasty but just didn't hit the spot for me on the taro flavor I was looking forward to.I enjoyed a mini udon bowl with steak and garlic broccoli! Very delicious, the portion size for me was very filling with still some left over"
1/29/2020,4,"Super yummy,fairly cheap, and quick go-to spot for Asian food! Plenty of different sushi, bento boxes, and bowls to chose from! Rice bowls are huge and I always end up taking most of it home with me but who doesn't love leftovers! My only complaint would be the staff from time to time. I've had my order messed up several times which in my case (allergy) is a huge mistake. However, they have always kindly fixed my order."
3/31/2015,4,"My boyfriend and all of friends would rate this restaurant as a solid 5 stars. I on the other hand would rate this restaurant as a solid 4 stars. The food is always consistent. For the most part, I always stick to the same dish - udon stir fry noodle bowl with chicken. Over the weekend, I tried ordering this dish with pork but for some reason they couldn't make it that way. I've tried other things such as: wakame salad, krab cheese wontons, california roll, and mongolian beef. My boyfriend on the other hand typically orders the crunch roll and curry katsu with pork. Overall, the food is pretty good and the portions are nice. They offer happy hour Monday - Friday from 4pm - 7pm. For the happy hour - if you buy 2 rolls you get one free. If you check into Yelp while dining, you get a free appetizer (anything from the starters & sides). Overall, the prices are reasonably priced. I'm not really sure why this restaurant doesn't have better reviews. I'm a fan (hence the 4 stars) but it's not as good as it gets."
6/6/2021,1,"The sushi was okayish, but the service was horrible. The waitress and waiter serving us were just tossing the plates in the middle of the table and walking off. The restrooms were very dirty, too."
5/23/2021,3,"Food always comes out good at this location but the customer service is poor half the time and could definitely be improved. I am a loyal customer and I usually do online order and pickup. When I stopped by today to pick up my order, the employees weren't attentive that I was standing at the front for a good 2-3 minutes, discussing a previous order. When they finally greeted me I told them I had a pickup order and the young lady told me my order was t ready yet, which was fine. I then waited 30 minutes after that and saw multiple online orders go out so I went to the counter myself again and asked if my order was ready because I had ordered about an hour ago and come to find out it had been sitting there for lord knows how long. I would've appreciated if the young lady who checked on my order was more attentive on the status of it and handed it out when it was ready. The resultant wasn't busy at all and there were only a few dine in and take out orders so for that mistake to happen is irritating. When the restaurant is busy how much more are they not paying attention to the customers?"
3/6/2019,2,"I'm a huge Bento dan - but not a big fan of it now being all quick service. It was a terrible experience vs. eating in. So sad my favorite ""restaurant"" no longer exists!"
2/1/2020,1,"Came here for dinner with 2 others and all of us recieved almost 0 sauce on our meals, went and asked for a little extra sauce and their employee Brandi was extremely rude. Been living in the area my whole life going here, will be sure to never go back. Thanks Brandi."
11/11/2016,5,"Always a great lunch place!!!!  Food is delicious and very affordable! Love the fact that they are very quick with preparing the meals so it's great for a 30min lunch break! Also, there's a Yelp check-in free appetizer if you spend $10 or more which is a big plus!"
12/14/2018,5,"I love this cute little cafe. Dropped in wanting sushi but quickly changed it up with the big selection. I ordered noodles with teriyaki chicken bowl. It was delicious and a large quantity. Definitely didn't leave hungry. They had pad Thai, sushi, rice and noodle bowls, regular sushi and then sides and add ons."
10/12/2016,3,"I enjoyed my veggie spring rolls and bento box! :) The food is definitely fresh! The service was really good too, and the food came out at a fast pace, which was nice. Surprisingly the food wasn't as hot temperature wise as I would have liked, but overall the food tasted good! The ambiance is nice and has a cozy feel, yet the restaurant space and layout is large enough to accommodate everyone in every corner of the room. There is a TV screen as well for anyone who wants to be entertained."
1/7/2018,3,"Friendly staff, LOTS of different options and plus a bubble milk tea option. We had pork grilled cajun rice bowl and half florida roll, with the lava roll. We also ordered green tea lychee with bubble and regular milk tea with bubble. Teas were pretty good.  Rice bowl was good too. I have to say, the sushi was a bit disappointing, rice has no taste, the lava combination with krab on top wasnt a hit. It wasn't flavorful enough. The sushi was a bit soggy.. other than the sushi the rest was good"
1/5/2020,1,"Asked for a side of sauce with my food, asked multiple times for the sauce I asked for with my order took 15 minutes to get the sauce I asked for. Food was cold by that time, then I asked for another sauce because the container was half full and it was a problem. Sorry but I just paid 12 dollars for my food sauce shouldn't be a problem if I ask for another one."
1/24/2020,5,Ordered delivery from here to our hotel last night. Everything was delicious and packaged well.
10/20/2016,5,"I've been to this place a couple of times, and have only had great experiences! I've had the vegetable stir fry, pad thai with noodles, and an avocado sushi roll.The atmosphere is modern and clean. The restaurant can get a bit noisy. The service is super quick as well! There is usually a line out the door when I've gone, so be prepared for that. Their tofu isn't mushy or gross, which is a huge plus for vegetarians."
1/16/2017,3,"Lots of items on the menu to choose from: Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc. Asian fushion for sure. I came here few times and every time was ok. Food flavor is forgettable, nothing that stood up to me. I tried their sushi few times and they were just mediocre. I mean I could eat them, but they taste pretty bland to me and I can never remember what I had for a meal afterwards! It never left an impression on me. Even their Thai or Chinese dishes were mediocre, I'd rather go to a Thai place to have a more authentic dish. It's a great place to hang out with coworkers."
2/11/2020,2,"This is a very popular spot for college students and the younger crowd. We ordered the special mex roll, and the Tuesday teriyaki bowl deal as well as the bogo Tuesday boba tea. We were in the waiting area for a solid 20 minutes just looking at the menu because there were so many options to choose from! When we arrived there was no crowd and a few minutes later there was a long line. When at the counter we encountered a very rude employee who at first ignored us at the register, and then was rude as we ordered. The Mexican roll was good, though certainly not one of the better sushi places I've had. The teriyaki bowl was terrible, the chicken was dry, and the rice bland. For boba tea I got the Thai tea with strawberry popping boba which I loved, and mango milk tea with regular boba which was awful, i changed it and asked for a suggestion which was the coconut milk tea mixed with the vanilla mixed tea and it wasn't so good either. The to go boxes were directly next to the trash can less then 4 inches away and some were upside down next to the trash can! When I asked for a water cup the employees seemed overwhelmed as they all mentioned how busy it was. At the time I would say it was busy, yet almost nobody was seated as most were to go orders. Overall the food was average to mediocre, and the service was god awful."
4/6/2017,4,"Great restaurant for a fast healthy meal. Their miso soup is delicious ! I like that you can order your own sushi roll with any proteins and other adding.its very affordable to eat here! There are a lot of vegetarian options too, Tofu is good and available for any if their bowls or bento box"
1/5/2020,1,"This bento is inferior to all the other bentos I've been to. The service is slow, they bring your food out of order and they are extremely stingy about their sauces. If I ordered a full plate of food, one sauce container filed only half way is NOT enough for my $12 plate of food. I am a paying customer and should not feel like a delinquent when I ask for more sauce. The lady even looked in my Togo bag when I asked her for more sauce to check if I already had some. On top of the fact that I had to go out of my way to ask for it twice, because they forgot. Oh, and they brought my soup like 15 mins after my food had gotten here and I was already full. Soup should've been the first thing out."
6/22/2016,5,"I cannot begin to explain how much I love Bento! For years it has been my go to sushi restaurant and I just wished I lived closer to it. It's located in Dr. Phillips and is a little on the small size. It's a quiet, intimate restaurant but on the relaxed side. There are also tables outside if the inside is packed and they have take out available as well. The staff is always really friendly and attentive. In the afternoons, you can order at the counter and then they will bring the food to you. In the evenings, it's a full service restaurant.My first love here is the Boba tea! I cannot go here without ordering one. They have tons of flavors but I'm perfectly content with the plain milk flavor. My next love is the sushi. Their noodle bowls always look so good but I always end up with sushi and sashimi. My favorite is the Special Mexican Roll. My husband loves their O Town Roll. Their sashimi plates are huge! Their fish is always fresh! This trip we used the Yelp coupon for a free appetizer when you check in. We got the pork dumplings but someone made a mistake and brought us the chicken dumplings too. They were super hot and we preferred the pork but I wasn't in love. For dinner I tried something new! The spicy tuna don sashimi bowl was to die for! Tons and tons of tuna in a bed of rice with avocado and cucumber! I have a new love! It will definitely be hard to pick something to eat now that I have multiple favorites!"
12/9/2019,1,"Went 2 times, 1st time forgot spicy mayo for poke bowl and sushi. 2nd time was a 43min wait for a pickup order. Nobody was in the restaurant while the sushi chefs stood there and talked, finally got up and said is my order ready after 25min.  Tried giving this location the benefit of the doubt, but no dice. I won't be back."
2/1/2017,5,Love the food here. Looks like happy hour will be my next attempt. Lots of choices and something for everyone
1/28/2017,4,"I used to go to bentos when I lived in Gainesville.  It was one of my go to restaurants. When I saw it was in Orlando as well, I had to go! They have locations in Tallahassee and Jacksonville as well.  I got the bento box and as always it was great! The green beans and ginger salad are really good.  You really can't go wrong but I usually get tofu szchewan or tofu hunan.  They have excellent boba teas as well.  I got the Thai tea with popping mango boba and my friend got the milk tea smoothie. We both loved it!! The service is great and the staff is very friendly.  This location has ample parking and there is outdoor seating options as well.  I was highly recommended eating here for a quick asian meal!! Also, doubt forget to use the check in deal- I got garlic edamame ( super yum!)"
4/20/2017,5,"Love this place. Low key with reasonable prices and free wifi. Good place to grab lunch and do some work or relax. Menu has a lot of variety, including rice bowls, noodle bowls, and bento  boxes (duh!). All the typical Asian favorites too - pad Thai, bulgolgi, teriyaki, katsu, sushi rolls, and Boba tea. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."
3/6/2019,2,This food better be great. Took them an hour to fix a Grub Hub to go order for one person! Like seriously?! I'm pregnant and HANGRY it's not even peak lunch time! I'm also mad they have the driver waiting...tying up their money. Do better!Update: I apologize it was Door Dash. They can't possibly say they didn't have any long orders because i had to call twice. My driver just left there 5 or so minutes ago. I'm still waiting.
1/9/2017,4,"Food is great, service leaves something to be desired. Volcano roll is amazingggg comes with 10 peices. Sushi combo box for 10 bucks is a great deal. I went there for a birthday gathering my waiter forgot to put my meal into the order meaning while my entire party was eating i was waiting. When everyone was finished my dinner was finally brought out very unpleasant situation. After i expressed how i felt The manager very generously gave us $3 off our $80 check. Which in my opinion was insulting. Great place to get food to go not worth the Hassle of sitting and waiting hours for food."
7/18/2018,1,"Bento is officially bent-NO for me after my experience there today. Between the lack of customer service and bizarre mishaps, I truly would rather go elsewhere for ANY meal. Let me begin. 1. The line was literally out the door and they had one person handling in store orders and online orders. I honestly witnessed an Ubereats person waiting for over 20 minutes to then be told they didn't have the order because they didn't have power? If this is the case, there needs to be some communication here. Unprofessional. 2. By the time my friend and I got to the register and started to order...the person taking our order was snapping at us for items that were UNAVAILABLE due to ""no power""...for example udon noodles. Again, if this is the case, there's a way to say things and not to say things to customers. There were about 30+ people waiting behind us still at this point receiving the same customer service. 3. I paid for my meal on an employees personal cell phone. To the point that I could see their push notifications from different APPS on their phone as I was paying. That is very strange to me. There should be a plan in place if your systems are down.4. My friend and I basically enjoyed our meal in the dark because the power continued to go out multiple times. Listen....I know things happen, but the way the staff was acting was unacceptable. They were more concerned with fanning themselves with their menus due to the no AC then anything else taking place in the restaurant. 5. They finally decided they should close the restaurant and placed a handwritten note on the door saying ""SORRY WE'RE CLOSED"" in sharpie. It was honestly comical. Again....they should have closed as everything taking place was a train wreck...BUT...the note on the door could have been a little more descriptive and polite stating they were sorry for any inconvenience. I really could say more, but I think you get the point. When my friend and I left we looked around at the rest of the plaza and everyone else had power. Not sure what was going on but it was truly a hot mess. I can't even comment on the food because the saga of events truly made my meal unmemorable."
4/30/2020,5,"The best Sushi in town! They have great happy hour specials,  so make sure to check those out!"
3/23/2014,4,"I ordered delivery from Bento, so I can't comment on the atmosphere or service at the physical location.Bento has quite a mix of options - there's sushi, Thai curries, Korean BBQ bowls and even some Chinese options. That worried me a little - when a place tries to do everything, quality usually suffers. Fortunately, the sushi was pretty tasty and very fresh.I had the Golden Knight & Red Dragon rolls - pretty much slightly different variants on shrimp, crab & tuna combined. If you want a sauce (lets say sriracha...) it's going to run you $.50 to $1 extra. Otherwise, the prices were extremely fair - from $8-13 for the special or ""executive"" rolls. The presentation and knife cuts on the fish weren't the prettiest, but for delivery sushi who cares?Overall, I was really happy with Bento Café. The delivery min ($12) was reasonable, my order arrived about 15 minutes early & the driver was friendly and my food was really very good. I'd order again with no hesitation."
6/1/2018,4,My co workers love Bento!  It's right in the heart of Dr Phillips and is near I-drive.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  Try a strawberry milk tea with boba (~$4) and the spicy creamy chicken with white or brown rice (~$8).  You can get noodles or sushi too.  Order ahead so you don't have to wait in the long lines.
2/27/2020,3,It really shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to make sushi bento boxes when the restaurant was empty when we got here.  Food seems good - I haven't received mine yet - 32 minutes of waiting.
10/2/2016,4,Always come here on my first night in Orlando. Love it. Always have a bento box as well as a spider roll and an appy. Loving the new Tokyo roll. And a nice cold Sapporo. Try it next time in town. I've fallen for the sushi combo bento box. Go for the Mt Fuji roll and the rainbow roll. Great.
3/18/2020,5,"If I could give this place enough stars! I live in the same plaza and eat here at least once a well! Love their poke bowls, rolls and chicken!"
4/22/2018,5,I always get my spicy cream chicken today I decided to do a rice bowl instead of a bento box!  The food tasted fresh I was able to finish it all!  Since we came in around 10pm we had to order our food first and hen seat versus getting seated.  Downtown Orlando has this concept I like it!   Our food came out pretty fast.
10/26/2016,5,"Bento Cafe has been one of my favorite Asian quick service/table service restaurants in Orlando for many years now. It was a usual stop for me with friends or solo when I was deeply craving sushi. I just went back the other day for the first time since moving back to Orlando to indulge in some Sunday sushi takeout. They have not lost their touch.Lunch at Bento is quick service style. You order at the counter, you get a number, and a friendly staff member will bring you your food. In the evenings for dinner though they do full-service. I like that mix where lunch is a faster go than in the evenings where I would prefer to sit down and have a longer chat with family or friends. Two menus are available. You've got your sushi menu with some awesome weekday lunch specials and then your regular bento box entree menu. I can honestly say I've tried a range of things at Bento and loved all of them. A dear friend of mine (shout out to Ada C.!) is a big bubble tea fan here. She couldn't get enough of that stuff. As a matter of fact, she was the one that introduced me to Bento Cafe. All in all what I mean to say is Bento is an awesome lunch spot."
2/14/2020,5,"I love this place! They have so many options it's insane! I typically order a rice bowl that I design. I'm a vegan and the tofu here is to DIE for. I don't know what they do, how they do it, but it's incredible. Some of the best tofu I've had. The staff is always friendly, polite, and hard working. When they are busy, they try their absolute best to make sure everyone is happy. This place is always a go to for me for food quality, quantity, and the staff!"
3/12/2020,5,I really like the Poke regular bowl. The steamed shrimp and salmon were perfect. Try the sushi rolls with Spicy Mayo it is the best combination. Pretty nice presentation.
10/26/2016,5,"Despite the name I've never had a Bento Box at Bento Cafe. I love the sushi at Bento.  My favorite is the TNT roll which elevates and clarifies the flavors of the spicy tuna roll.  The flacors are crisp and jolting.  I also enjoy the crispy dumplings which are served with an amazing sipping sauce--no boring soiy ginger here--this sauce is firey and spicy and tangy--it gives me life!The service at Bento is always too slow for an impatient person like me, so I typically call ahead and pick up my order.  The decor is modern, dark, clean lines, and spacious.  They have a few locations around the city, but not enough for my tastes!"
4/17/2020,5,"Today my daughter ordered chicken tariyaki for me and it was delicious, love the way the food was placed, it was very presentable, Thank You bento, my wife and I, dont eat asian food just any where, but after enjoy your food, i will continue to order from you folks thank you again bento in margaritavile, in Kissimmee, Fla"
11/25/2018,4,"Casual style dining were you order at the front, sit down, and food is brought to your table. There are plenty of hot dishes sushi, and poke. We ordered the build your own poke, and the flying dragon roll. The fish in the poke (spicy tuna and spicy salmon) as extremely fresh. This place was very busy the entire time we were there on Saturday around 12, which is good helping confirm fresh food. I appreciated that the had toppings such as avocado and cream cheese, since a lot of poke I've had charge extra for avocado, and I haven't seen any that offer cream cheese. I wanted to try the boba tea, but we way too full. We definitely enjoyed the food here, the service was really friendly, and there also lots of parking. I definitely recommend this place, and I would  come back"
9/25/2018,4,"I wouldn't say the food is high quality but they have a great variety of Asian foods. They have noodles, sushi, and rice bowls. If you check in you also get a free appetizer! We had a pretty large party come in, and everyone left with a full belly. Every time I go to Florida, I have been back to Bento for the spicy cream pao pao. The portions are generous, if you are looking for smaller portions they have mini poke bowls."
2/8/2016,4,"This place makes me nostalgic for my UF undergrad life... But you're not here to read about that. The sushi is good but not great, the Cantonese pork chop bento box is generously-sized, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. They recently did away with table service but this is still a great place for a fast lunch or dinner. Bonus: most of the food is really reasonably-priced!"
6/27/2014,3,"I pretty much grew up on Bento in Gainesville (original beginnings of this restaurant), so I was happy to hear that they were opening two locations in Orlando (where I am originally from).  The food quality is about the same but the prices are a little more expensive than Gainesville.  I did not enjoy the layout of the restaurant versus both Gainesville locations.This location is more of a wait-staff type restaurant, which is OK but the implementation here is not stellar.  I'm not sure why it took us 40 minutes to get our food, but that's a long time compared to the speediness of the Gainesville locations.  Needless to say, I like the food, but I would be hesitant to come back due to the slow implementation."
9/18/2016,5,"Just had an awesome dinner at Bento! Boyfriend got the lava, balihai and 151 rolls. All were so good. The 151 was a gorgeous presentation! The best I have ever seen anywhere and we eat a lot of sushi. I got the tuna salad bowl. Perfect combo of flavor from tuna, avocado, Wakame salad and ponzu sauce. So fresh and filling. We also started with the spicy edemame. Gotta love a free appetizer with Yelp check in! Nice kick if you like spicy. Service was also very friendly. Great dinner all around. We will be back for sure. Might be our new fav sushi place!"
5/25/2016,4,"Bento is always a must to visit here when in the Orlando area.. Especially when your boyfriend is obsessed with the Spicy Cream. ...it is hard to find disappointing though. I've eaten at their Gainesville locations as well. All with friendly and quick service. Almost every dish I've tried has been very good. All of their prices range between $8-15, but I think it's all affordable for a night out. The sushi rolls are also worth mentioning and are either 8 or 10 pieces each for the same price range as mentioned above. We're pretty excited for their Davie location to open up!"
6/19/2018,4,"This is a great, counter service restaurant. The service is great and fast. I enjoyed my Mexican and Volcano rolls. The price is great. I'm glad they added pokè bowls into the menu."
3/13/2016,4,"This place is nice right in the middle of all the action in Orlando. They have a wide variety of options including sushi, rice bowls, and salads with sushi. I ordered the build your own salad. The prices are pretty good for what you can get. I got spicy salmon and pan seared tuna. The salad was a nice size with fresh vegetables. The service was kind of slow though especially if being a Saturday afternoon. That was my only complaint but otherwise this is a nice restaurant to come to for a healthy option."
5/28/2019,1,I got terrible food poisoning from eating here two days ago along with my brother and my mom. We ordered sushi and the lo mein and spicy cream chicken. I will absolutely never return here. I don't know what's up with their cleaning practices but I warned you guys.
5/27/2019,1,My girlfriend and I got terrible food poisoning from here.. puking non stop for 6 hours. Either salmonella or E. coli.... Do not eat here!!!!!
12/1/2015,4,"If you are looking for quick and casual Asian cuisine, Bento is your place. Yes, Pei Wei is just up the street but Bento's menu has a better assortment of Asian food and dishes feels more authentic. If only they had the fanciful Coca Cola machines...Menu highlights include Bento boxes, noddle bowls and rice bowls. They also have an extensive sushi menu. I'm not a fan of seafood so I'll just say they have tons of options.If you haven't tried Boba Teas, go for it! You only live once. My favorite is Taro."
11/13/2015,3,"The key word to remember when walking into Bento is ""variety"". They have an extensive menu with a sampling of noodle dishes, rice dishes, salads and of course sushi. Location wise, it is tucked in the same shopping center as Bar Louie right on Sandlake, which is a pretty good local for the area. We went with the basics of what you expect from a sushi bar and ordered sushi. They have a plethora of rolls and even a few specials that allow you a sampling of atleast 3 or 4 rolls, which is what I went with and glad I did. There were a lot of interesting house rolls, so I grabbed a few of those and went on about my day. Overall, the sushi quality was good, it was not spectacular and was far from disappointing. I would stop by and grab some rolls at Bento again when in the area, no question. Also, my friend apparently is a Boba tea enthusiast and almost lost her mind when she realized they served it here....so, if that is your thing...there you go!"
7/29/2015,4,"Definitely a place I would recommend and would return to. They have a wide variety of options representing Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese and Chinese cuisines. It was really tough to decide - I probably took 10 minutes looking at the menu because there are so many things I wanted to try. You can get a rice bowl or noodle bowl or soup bowl or bento box...My waitress was getting restless so I just went with one of their signature items - spicy cream rice bowl with chicken.  It wasn't really spicy fortunately but the sauce was very sweet. Too sweet, in fact and the main reason I went with 4 stars. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. No problem though as I'm sure I can find many other items on the menu to please my taste buds. Their drink menu is also extensive. Many flavors of milk teas, green teas and others that you can choose from and add jellies, pearls or boba to. They also serve a variety of beers and sake. Desserts include mochi and green tea ice cream.The restaurant has a cool, modern motif and the chefs frying, chopping, doing what they do, add to the ambience and energy of Bento.  They have many locations throughout Florida and soon TAMPA!!!!!"
6/16/2015,5,"American Sushi at its Best!Great new location with lots of parking.A lot of ""millenials"" enjoying dinner here!Restaurant Vibe is Chill!I had an excellent Sushi combo of: California Roll, Fuji Roll, Dragon Roll, Algae: Everything Delish!Check: Reasonable!I love it!!!"
10/30/2018,4,"Four star review with a caveat: I would never get any of the poke or sushi here. If I had to include a review of their poke/sushi options, this review would be 2 stars at best, but since I just ignore those options entirely, I'll base this review on their cooked entrees (bento boxes, rice bowls, etc).For the price, Bento delivers quality meals. Katsu chicken, curries, sriracha chicken, stir fry, even the vietnamese pork chops are awesome here. The miso is decent (not the best) and their servings are generous.They can be pretty busy, and the lines can move slow when new customers have all the options explained to them at the counter. But if you can wait for ~15 to place an order during a lunch rush, it's worth it. Even better if you can stop by when things are slow. Service is usually fast.Now let's talk about the sushi/poke options briefly. On the few rare occasions I've had the poke or sashimi, I've found bones. There have also been a handful of times that the tuna poke had very inconsistent quality in the same bowl (probably came from multiple fish, at multiple times of the day). And worse of all, the servers often forget during busy times to provide a soy sauce dish with sushi/sashimi entrees, and they can be impossible to call over since they only pop out to deliver food, and never to check on tables (it's a serve yourself environment).Despite having horrible experiences with the sushi/poke options (due to quality and service) I still love the rest of the options."
6/9/2017,5,"First time here. Order at a counter and a server brings your food to you.  I had the Sesame Chicken Bowl, rice, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, snow peas and sweet soy sauce. Delish. Chicken was moist, the vegetables crunchy and the soy sauce blended all the flavors. The pork egg roll was crispy and savory. I had a lychee to drink, sweet with pulp. The server was attentive and continued to check with us. Excellent dining experience."
4/20/2017,4,"My favorite part of Bento Cafe is all of the options--you can get sushi, traditional American Chinese food, Poke Bowls, and a few other Asian options. I can be as healthy (or unhealthy) as I want, and everything is really reasonably priced.Until 5 Bento Cafe is more of a quick service restaurant--ordering at the counter and having the food delivered to you. After 5 it turns into the traditional sit-down experience, and I really wish it wouldn't. The service that I had when I visited last week was pretty terrible--my water was never refilled and it took ~15-20 minutes to get our food, which was pretty ridiculous for how un-busy it was. I've loved all of the sushi rolls that I've had here (the Florida roll is my favorite), and the krab wontons were tasty. Last time I went my boyfriend and I both ordered the General Tso's chicken, and we were really disappointed. The sauce didn't have nearly enough flavor--it just tasted like sweet, fried chicken. Overall, Bento Cafe is a great (relatively) local option for fast-casual food in the Dr. Phillips area."
4/19/2018,4,"Came here with my friend on a rainy evening-- great decision! This spot cured my craving for Asian food. Their boba was surprisingly delicious, I'll definitely be returning for it. The bento box was awesome-- lots of food and all delicious. Plus, noodles AND rice? Such a winner. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night, so we'll have to come back and try it out again!"
1/18/2018,4,"We go here often, mostly because it's close, and a great value for the sushi. We've only ever been for lunch. Sushi is always good, the udon soup is great, and the boba tea was the first thing that got us in the door. One of the few places on this side of town to get decent boba."
12/29/2017,3,Food was a little to oily for my likings. I ordered the Spicy Cream udon noodles. But it was surprising when my food had alot of oil.
4/30/2013,5,"**This update is based solely on the follow up**I was contacted by Bento Cafe's GM regarding my Yelp review about a week later, apologizing on my first experience at Bento's. She wrote about what had happened that night and invited us back to the restaurant to give it another chance. I was super surprised that the GM actually cared enough to reach out to me... that is AMAZING customer service. I definitely appreciate those in management/leader positions who acknowledge the problem, and do something about it to fix the situation. Great follow-up!"
11/14/2018,5,"I went this afternoon and had a great experience. The menu is clear and easy to understand, and the mini poke bowl isn't what i would consider small by any means- i'm going to get 2 meals out of it. the fish portion is generous and the flavors are delicious. it's a nice combination of self service and full service, the restaurant has a nice ambiance. I will definitely be back! My pic is after I had already taken a bite, very delicious!"
1/14/2018,4,"Constant customer! I am always coming here. Their sushi is yummy. But I will admit, do not come in here and expect their sushi to be the ultimate best, authentic sushi in the world because that's not Bento. Their sushi is tasteful, good portion size, and the price is very reasonable. Presentation is done well. They're other dishes like the rice or noodle bowls are also delicious. Spicy creme bowl is my favorite. I would recommend this place since their food is good and affordable!! The atmosphere is chill so that's another plus"
8/20/2015,5,"This place is very posh. And when we came during lunch time, it was absolutely packed. All the tables were taken, and there was a long line to order. I had a Milk tea bubble tea, sliced beef noodle soup, and we shared meat steamed dumplings (3). The bubble tea was pretty good! The tea was a little sweet, but I just added water. The bubbles had good taste. The noodle soup was such a big portion! The noodles were delicious and just the whole thing in general was delish haha The dumplings were ok My family got the bento boxes w salad lo mein They were Americanized, and not as good as my noodle soup!"
5/11/2015,5,"I don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars. It's the best sushi restaurant. The rolls have so much flavor and are a good size. This time I got sushi rolls to go. Crunch roll-seaweed on the outside with tempura, tuna, cream cheese, krab and cucumber inside, eel sauce Special Mexican- shrimp, krab, avocado and cream cheese, spicy mayo sauce"
3/9/2015,3,"The three stars are for their slow service and boba.  I enjoyed the beef pad Thai.  Since I've been to so many sushi restaurants these past two months, I can't really say if I enjoyed it.  I'm sushi'd out lol.I also did the yelp check-in to get the free appetizer, but he didn't adjust that off the bill.  I even reminded him and he still didn't."
11/30/2015,3,"I've dined at Bento Cafe a number of times, and realized I've never written a review! Here goes:First, this place is a solid 3.5 stars. I really enjoy the food here. Their sushi has always been fresh and delicious. I really like the Bali High Mango, Gucci, and Volcano rolls. Of their stir fry / grill menu, you house flavor, a protein, and whether you want it a a Bento box, rice bowl, or noodle bowl. For the price, their portions are generous and filling. My favorites are the beef bulgogi, rr Mongolian beef, and the spicy cream chicken. I love bubble tea smoothies, sometimes with biba, sometimes with jelly. I'm sad to say their Boba is not always fresh. I've tried it multiple times, sometimes the texture is perfect, but just as many times the Boba is hard and cold. The jelly is always a safe bet here... although they did stop serving the strawberry jelly. Now they only have mango jelly (which they were out of tonight), passion fruit (I need to try), and lychee (yummm). They have also added on the fruit flavored bobas, the type you get at the frozen yogurt placea.  There are 2 flavors. I don't recall what flavor they are. When looking for a quick, fresh, delicious meal in the Restaurant Row area, Bento Cafe is a great option."
12/15/2019,1,"Not good... constant problems whenever I go or order online. Both with door dash and Uber eats always have problems. They are not customer centered, and do not try to accommodate their customers. They have messed up my order numerous times, and do little to fix it. Constantly forget items when I order online. Normally not one to complain, but they have messed up my order 90% of the time. Gets a bit old. And they aren't very apologetic. My parents have been in the restaurant business for many years.. your business will not keep its customers if it continues like this."
10/12/2015,4,"We loved the sushi that we tried here! It had a nice variety rolls to try. The happy hour deal kicked ass and allowed us to try even more rolls! Also, enjoyed the garlic edamame. This was the first time that we experience seasoned edamame and it was fantastic! It appeared that this location can get busy during peak hours."
12/20/2018,5,"I first came into Bento in a whim. I needed food and it was nearby, but boy was that a lucky choice. First of all, the restaurant is well-designed and CLEAN. It looks like a high quality national chain, despite being relatively small. Staff is friendly and the food never takes long, even if there are a lot of people there. They can handle a rush well.Now to the important part: the food. I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but they have plenty of other options. The bento boxes offer the opportunity to have some of their protein options without having too heavy of a meal. The rice bowls let you get a lot of their protein and the sides offer an easy way to sample some of their other fares. They have a lot of food/protein options that are highly customizable. Thus far, my favorites have been the garlic broccoli with steak and the Polynesian chicken. My mouth is watering just thinking of these.The prices are very reasonable for the amount and a quality of food you get. Overall, they have easily earned their 5 stars every single time I go. I would recommend this for a good work lunch or a casual night out!"
1/23/2019,4,"Ever since we discovered the place, we kept coming back every time we visit Orlando. The only place I really love the crab wanton. Don't get the egg rolls. Doesn't taste good.. sushi is not too expensive. The way the service of this place is kinda weird. Lunch time u order at the counter then take a seat. Dinner time they have servers. Kinda useless."
3/26/2018,4,This is a really great spot for some good sushi and they always have new rolls to try.  The place is super clean and the staff is very nice.  The setting is pretty relaxed but not super casual.  Their rice and poke bowls are really good too.  Only four stars because their service has always been rather slow.
5/27/2018,4,Great sushi! Fresh! They skimp on the wasabi but not hard to ask for more. I've only had the rainbow roll and edamame both times I'vegone. Staff is friendly. I've had bites of other rolls of my husbands and friends and they were great! Definitely recommend.
1/6/2017,1,"Service is almost non existence and they don't care. Management there is no presence at all. Came in on a Thursday night sign was up for please wait to be seated. Not a problem, waited for 5 minutes for someone to come up. When the hostess did arrive she stated that it would be 5 minute wait. Really there were empty tables all around and it's not like I had 10 people with me there were 3. I was trying to make the sushi happy hour and it ended at 6 lol I got seated at 557 and got attitude from the server to want to order."
3/8/2017,4,Not so bad! My daughter loves the boba tea choices and we usually get the lunch specials to maximize the meal choices. I'd love to go back and try some of their other sushi to see if it's as good as it looks. The menu is large and there is plenty of seating for everyone. Check it out and see what you find on the menu that you may like. I need to venture out some too so let me know.
10/6/2019,1,I give this place 1/2 star. First the crab wontons were just cream cheese. The garlic broccoli chicken noodles had no flavor. Would never go back.
3/10/2015,5,"This is by far my favorite Sushi spot in Orlando. In the last 2 months, I've probably gone 6-7  times. Their service has been GREAT each time and their food is fresh, quick & amazing! Great, laid back atmosphere. The ""Gucci"" is my favorite roll so I definitely recommend that with some chicken fried rice. Comes in a huge bowl, too! Their pricing is fair - pretty common for Sushi restaurants. For 2 plates of sushi and fried rice, my girl and I usually spend about $35."
5/17/2019,5,"SO SO GOOD. I was very happy to eat here. Happened to go with a large group of people for lunch and was very pleased. They did not have lunch menu but prices were amazing which is why I'll definitely be back. I paid $11.75 for the sushi combo box and I was so pleased. Very tasty and while I wasn't ""full"" after I was satisfied. Would e totally bought more since prices were minimal but I had somewhere to be after and did not want to get the itis. My food as well as my other party wmmeber who got sushi came out last compared to everyone else at my table who got cooked foods or poke bowls. But I'm certain that's because they had to hand roll the sushi at the counter so I'm okay with that. Plus it was a busy lunch hour on a FRIDAY so I was not phased when it came out 10-15 mins give or take after ordering. Place was very well kept and the staff was SUPER on top of clearing the table after eating. What's special is u get a complimentary special dipping sauce. I had the poke soy and it was AWESOMeeee if u like to dip your sushi in soy sauce I recommend that. There are others but this one seemed like the lightest option and closest to soy sauce. Also added a bit of wasabi which set it off. Wasabi was also fresh which I appreciated (meaning it was soft and not hard and had great taste--if u like and eat wasabi u know what I mean). Will totally be back! There's a happy hour too 3-6. And there's an extensive bubble tea list! And it's decently priced 3.5-7 I think. Great for families. Dates. And so on. Thanks bento!"
9/15/2017,4,"It's very hard to go wrong whenever you eat Bentos. I've been to multiple of their locations (Downtown Orlando, South Florida, and this one) and all of them always have pretty good service and of course good food. If you're ever craving for quick Asian food than bentos is definitely the way to go! Or if you're in the mood for pretty decent priced sushi or poke bowl too. Spicy cream chicken noodle bowl is always a favorite of mine as well as spicy tuna poke bowl."
4/7/2018,5,"My girlfriend and I recently tried this for the first time, she loves Poke Bowls and was interested to try this place out. I got the Mongolian bowl with Steak and mini udon, she got a Mexican roll with a salmon poke bowl. Every single bite was fantastic, the fish was top quality, and all the sauces were on point. The drinks were superb as well. But what really made this meal special was our server, Wenderson. He helped us decide what to get, with his own flares on certain plates and had a plethora of knowledge from the menu. He constantly checked on us, and was incredibly excited when he heard we loved our food. He is easily one of the best servers we have ever had, bar none! If you like Asian Fusion, make sure to stop by here, and don't hesitate to ask for Wenderson. He was an absolute delight and you can quickly tell he loves what he does and is an expert in his craft."
9/27/2020,2,Can't take a simple order online without messing it up. Very rude when i called and and complained.
6/30/2018,3,"The cashier was friendly and nice. There was 5 of us and  we ordered about $100 worth of food. Seems a little pricey for lunch, but maybe we have big appetites lol. The place wasn't very busy but half of the tables weren't clean? Okay maybe they finished with a rush... By the time I flagged someone and ask her to clean the table we wanted to sit at she just replied with ""don't worry I am on the way"", I wouldn't say it was with a negative attitude but I would assume I was bothering her by asking, based off of the tone in her voice. The dumplings came out pretty quickly and were delish! Great size and good portion. The bowls came out next. I had ordered the Szechwan beef and asked if i could get it with udon noodles. IT ALREADY COMES WITH UDON NOODLES. But the receipt isn't itemized so I can't confirm if I was up charged for the change to larger udon noodles. The sushi took the longest to come out, about 27 min for 6 rolls. They were good. The food was good, not great, I don't believe it's worth the price considering we have other options at the same price point for better quality."
6/14/2018,5,"Bento has great staff and management at all locations that I've visited. Very clean and welcoming.  The Bento Box menu item is my favorite along with some of the rolls I've ordered.  Never disappointed in my meal. I've introduced friends to Bento and they've been very pleased.The wait for my order is reasonable considering how busy they get at times.  In and out within a lunch break. If you haven't tried Bento, i assure you that you'll enjoy!Thank you owners and staff for making such a great product and for serving your guests with excellence.Eric"
10/10/2019,2,"Been here several times and the food really is great. Pretty dissatisfied with my experience tonight though. My experience tonight is owed to Jenyelle. When my wife and I walked up to the counter, it seemed like we rudely interrupted her conversation. She spoke apathetically and quietly. Clearly had better things to do. She got my order wrong (Szechuan noodle soup) and when I went up to have it corrected I was greeted with ""oh you wanted the noodle soup. Ok. that'll be $12"" I said no thanks I'm not paying more for what I should've had to begin with. I'll go to Susuru the next time I want ramen."
5/22/2017,1,So annoyed by them. I have eaten there several times. I have also Uber ordered as well. And it was amazing. And great price today I got all the way through placing an order for my family and then it said unavailable. So I thought fine I will call and pick it up. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I figured they are busy and forgot me so I called again to only get a busy signal for the next 10 minutes of trying.
7/7/2019,5,"I went with my family from Jacksonville, because we LOVE Bento Jacksonville location, but we came to Orlando to enjoy our summer and decided stop at this bento to eat! We ordered volcano special thinking it was be the same menu as Jacksonville , but to our surprise, it's not! And the manager, Clarissa, made it possible for us and it was amazing!!!! Even better that the volcano special from the Jacksonville location! Five stars to this place for their food and their service!"
5/3/2013,4,"Consistently delicious! I tend to frequent Bento Cafe for dinner with a friend, and am never dissapointed. They offer an extensive sushi menu as well as several other dishes that can be cusomtives as a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box with your choice of protein. If you visit between 4PM and 7PM, the offer a happy hour which includes a buy two get one free sushi offer. Prices are resonable. A noodle bowl with tofu or chicken costs $7.75 and the Veggie Delite sushi roll I ordered costs $6.25. As I usually stick with vegetarian sushi, I enjoy Bento as they have a few more veggie options than most places. The Veggie Delite roll is by far my favorite, as it is topped with a piece of fried tofu that really adds to the roll. As far as the other entree options, I have always opted for the noodle bowl and have never been displeased. There are a good 20-30 different styles for the bowl, so I always look to try something new and always find it enjoyable. Bento Cafe also serves Boba tea. Although I have not tried it personally, I know it is something that is relatively rare in the Orlando area!I highly reccomend Bento Cafe!"
2/11/2020,2,"I came for the Tuesday Special which is the $6 chicken teriyaki bowl & I added the Special Mex roll (4 pieces) for $5 & of course I couldn't leave without the BOBA tea BOGO (Buy 1 get 1 free). The wait was pretty long (10 mins to order) but it was pretty busy which is expected on a Tuesday. When I placed my order the waiter was VERY rude. She told me the wait for my 4 piece roll would be 20-35 mins, I just asked her why is that? Out of curiosity & She replies ""because were busy"" with a huge attitude & rolled her eyes. So I ignored it and placed my order anyway. I noticed another guest had a Bento card and got stamps so I asked her about it and wanted to get stamps as well, yes she gave me one but when my friend asked for one she rolled her eyes. Very unprofessional. So after we take our seat our food comes out. The sushi she said would take 20-35 mins came after 3 mins , the teriyaki bowl comes 5 mins later. The portion was pretty big however, my chicken was so dry I left all the chicken and just ate the rice and green beans however I didn't get my BOBA tea until I have eaten 80% of my bowl. (About 30 mins later) And when I mention my tea was missing the staff is acting like I annoy them. It was to the point where we were scared to ask for a To-go box. But after finding the courage to ask for one, the staff points to the TRASH can where the to-go boxes are located upside down ! Very nasty image when you think about putting food in it. However the only good thing I can say is the Special Mex roll was the highlight. Very good. The BOBA BOGO deal is great too if you can find a tea that's actually tasty. Overall I had to give the restaurant a 2/5 stars and that's being generous."
8/15/2019,5,"This place is my jam after work! So friendly, the food is amazing, and such quick service! But I'm so sad they took away so many Milk tea flavors! The LAVENDER MILK TEA was my favorite! Please bring it back! My cashier/server was so sweet to punch my boba tea card extra when he realized they didn't have what I wanted."
11/12/2016,5,Was looking for an Asian Fusion place near Universal and this place was amazing. I just wish I could have tried more of their menu and that they had a location in Tampa.I love that they price some of their sushi rolls at 4 pieces. The terriyaki chicken bent was amazing and the rice bowls are huge.
4/3/2018,5,"Bento's sushi never fails. Honestly it's sooooo good, though the prices may be higher than other sushi spots it's delicious. Our server Shaun was the best. He's helped us before and he's part of the reason we come"
6/30/2020,5,The sushi is fresh and great and the ramen noodles are good!! If I'm ever back in the area I will be eating here for sure!
6/17/2017,5,Food was delicious. Very good flavors and nice presentation. BUT customer services is the worst ever!! We have to put our hands up like 10 times for one of the servers noticed us. Since the moment we arrive I knew it was gonna be tragic the greeter wasn't in the front we had to wait for him. But well... food is really good and the place very cute. Other than that needs better customer service
4/7/2019,4,I like this place but my wife and her family say the quality has gone down over the years. Decent Asian food at a decent price. Food comes quick.
7/24/2020,5,I love everything about this place. I've been going for years. Buuuuuut I think it's time for the sushi chef to sharpen his knives haha... the rolls weren't cut all the way through. Still super tasty tho
5/8/2020,5,This Bento service is great. This was the first place I dined at after moving to FL. The food is good and I will go back.
7/20/2019,4,The environment at the restaurant was pretty chill. The staff was awesome and made the experience great for my family and I. I ordered the yellow curry and it was exactly what I expected. The only thing I would have liked to have improved was the salad didn't have as much ginger sauce as I expected. Other than that would definitely recommend anyone who likes Asian food.
7/14/2020,4,I used to come all the time until it went downhill. I'm glad I decided to give them another try because I was very impressed with how they were handling covid procedures. I really hope they keep their online ordering system after all of this because it is so much easier than being placed on hold multiple times when trying to place an order for pick up.
9/5/2016,5,Second time was as good as the first. The sesame chicken bento box was delicious and plenty of food for the money.We'll be back!
3/24/2017,4,"If it hadn't been for service, I would have given it less stars but the food here is absolutely incredible! The make your own poke bowl is our favorite. We love to combine tuna and salmon with the mixed greens. Our favorite sauces are poke soy and spicy mayo.The problem we have with service is that wait staff pretends to know how to take orders without writing it down on paper but they really don't have that kind of experience. It's totally OK to humble yourself and take down the order on paper just to make sure it gets in for the chefs the right way."
9/9/2016,5,This is our go to sushi spot. We've been patrons of Bento for many years now. They have great options if you're not a sushi lover. They have great prices and the quantity of food is fantastic. Try the O-town roll. It's my personal favorite and it's quite delicious. Check in on Yelp and get a free app. We always get the pork pot stickers. Fried of course.The servers are always friendly and attentive. I was looking for my server and another server swung by to see if we were okay.They also now provide wi-fi which is awesome since their building has terrible cell service. This is a great place to pop in and out if you're in a time crunch.
8/6/2020,5,"I don't ever leave reviews but the service that Bento's gives even during this pandemic is better than any other restaurant I've been to since quarantine. You order at the door but the two people taking our order were really nice and helpful with everything we needed. We then waited outside for our food to be made and it was pretty hot outside so after a few minutes one of the guys who took our order came outside and joked around with us a little bit before asking if we wanted water bottles and immediately got them for us. Very good service and nice people, oh yeah and the food was absolutely fantastic as well :)"
4/18/2019,5,"I have been to a lot of Bentos but this location is great! From the sushi to the boba teas everything taste amazing. I can also truly say that the front hostess employee Echo, was absolutely the most helpful hostess/server I've ever had! Not only did she know practically everything on the menu she was also able to multitask! She helped a line of people ordering in such an efficient and timely matter while answering phone calls and giving out Uber eats! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting some good food and even better service!"
6/17/2019,1,"I agree with everything she said (Sarah C.), but would like to add, at her suggestion: Try Pei Wei instead!"
5/1/2019,4,"I've been coming here for a long time it's always a solid place to go for some sushi and rice bowls. I usually get the Korean rice bowl little bit spicy which is my thing and super filling! Very satisfying meal, only thing need to work on is being a little more efficient when ordering"
11/13/2018,5,I'm addicted. It's seriously the best. Everything they have is amazing! Bento sushi box
2/18/2015,4,"Bento Cafe is always a stop my friends and I take when in Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Orlando. Another restaurant Tampa could use! Bento was a variety of options of Asian cuisine to choose from- Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc. After you choose your ""style"", you get to choose the main protein of the dish (chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp) as well as whether it comes in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. The price varies of these three options but usually one meal is never more than $10 which is a steal!Their sushi is also pretty okay. Out of all the rolls I've ordered I have yet to be amazed at the sushi but that's not to say it's bad or anything. I just have yet to try any signature rolls. Overall, I am always satisfied with the food and recommend the spicy cream shrimp, chicken katsu, and bulgogi! The service is also always excellent."
1/31/2019,4,"First time at Bento and it was awesome! Ordering was easy, but it did take a little bit for our food to finally come out, but that's probably because half my family ordered sushi rolls. I had the bento sushi, which comes with the California roll (I think), then you pick two special rolls. I had the Mexican and the Rainbow roll. The rainbow roll was definitely my fav of the three. All of them were so delicious though. And did I mention they have Thai Tea!? I think it was about $3.50 and it comes in a pretty decent size. No refills though of the specialty drinks so drink 'em slow. I can't wait to go back and try their Boba teas!!"
1/17/2020,2,"I used to live downtown and went to that one weekly. So when this one opened up I was so excited. I was thinking this is my new spot. The food and customer services was always amazing at the other location so I was set. Unfortunately, for this location the customer service & food isn't as good. We've been in a couple times and every time something comes out wrong or if I get a to go order I'm always missing an item. I normally say something or call if that happens but they don't really care much. The food is great when I get it correctly. The customer service just feels like they don't care. It is what it is to them. Some people don't care about customer service but it can make or break a place to me."
8/18/2017,5,Great food. This place is good for lunch. They have good-quality sushi. Their vegetable and steak stir fry also tastes great.
7/12/2014,4,We love this place! Best deal is the sushi box.  My favorite roll is the Mt. Fugi sushi roll. We also love the Korean beef bulgogi and the Japanese curry. Pretty much can't go wrong with anything.
4/30/2018,4,"My kids and I ate here for dinner a few nights in Orlando. I know that these places have been around for some time, but I've never been to one even in Philly. My first time trying a bento box was delightful to say the least. Everything was delicious and fulfilling. The entire time we spent in Orlando, Bento Cafe was really the only place I wanted to eat. The variety of choices was appealing mostly because I am a vegetarian. So it was good to find a place to eat that accommodated my diet. The menu could be a little overwhelming, so many types of protein, sauces, noodles, etc. My next stop will be to find a good Bento cafe in Philly, I'm sure someone has Yelped about one, lol."
4/7/2017,3,This place was ok.  Fried rice dishes were decent.Bento box was lacking...only the entree was good.  Salad was old and wilted.  Noodles had NO flavor.Service was alright.I won't be back...
7/31/2018,5,"My girlfriend and I are constantly going here just about every other week. It's perfect for date night, sushi is amazing, chicken bowls are amazing, boba teas are amazing, there's nothing bad about this place!!"
12/18/2017,1,TODAY WAS TERRIBLE No avocado no brown riceServers was too slow...Holidays coming up ?I think quality is getting lower and lower
5/13/2020,1,"I used to love coming to this location like 5, 6 years ago but it has gone so downhill in the past couple years. From the customer service to how they prepare the food, definitely the worst Bento franchise which is very disappointing because it's the closest one to me. The straw that broke the camels back was this last Ubereats order, I wrote in the notes that I have an avocado allergy. When I received the order, I saw that they wrote on the receipt ""no avocado"" so I know that they saw it, and of course, my roll had avocado on it. The restaurant was closed after my food arrived so I did not expect for them to replace my food tonight but I called to let them know the error and how inconvenient it is for me now that I have nothing to eat for dinner. I work in a restaurant myself and allergies are to be taken very seriously! However, the woman I spoke to on the phone was so rude. I asked to speak to a manager because I wanted to make sure someone took this complaint seriously and she claimed that she was the manager, but I doubt it being she had such a bad attitude. I'd expect more patience from a manager, especially since I was not being out of line or rude myself even though this was very inconvenient to me, I do have respect for other people. I regret not asking for her name. Anyway, now I'm stuck here with nothing to eat for tonight & I will not be giving this location any more chances. Very disappointed. :("
4/16/2016,5,"By far the best Japanese restaurant ever. Sushi is first rate and the service is killer. For sushi I strongly recommend the Special Mexican Roll and a classic Spicy Tuna. For an entree, definitely go for the bento boxes as they're a great value. When you go ask for Jessica her service is above and beyond and definitely not just ""alright"". I'd eat at this restaurant everyday if I could.Ps Josh you shouldn't have taken Jessica out of your Yelp review just saying."
7/5/2014,4,"Happy hour is amazing!  Buy 2 rolls, get 1 free.  Doesn't get much better than that especially if you're hungry :)Well done! I'll definitely be coming back."
5/11/2019,5,Great fresh food. If your vegetarian. Tofu is great with that cream sauce. The sushi is so fresh as well.
9/24/2017,2,"Let me start by stating how much I love the food and the service at the downtown location. Now moving on to the Sandlake establishment.......1. They messed up our order and the server wasn't professional enough to say sorry or let me get my manager....... nope. He said : "" I didn't hear you order."" ..... really??2. Brings the order 20 minutes behind the rest of my table. 3. The check comes and the same server charges me for the others on the tables food and mine, plus takes 20 in cash that was provided by one if the people at the table.4. After all this inconvenience....... you would think a manager would appear correct???? Well nothing. Zip.Worst experience ever. Thing is I love the food, but this location has no professional courtesy whatsoever. Very disappointing."
2/20/2016,1,"I love going to this place never had a lot of issues but let me tell you why I gave it one star. I placed a to go order for their limited edition pork ramen soup and come to find out when I get there that I in fact couldn't get it to go after I've already paid for it. Now that's fine, it's whatever. But here's the kicker. When I got home and I'm digging into my salad I bite into something hard and rubbery and when I take it out, upon further examination, it's a wad of fucking gum. Old ass gum. It looked as if someone picked it out from the trash and placed it into my salad. I'm livid, who wouldn't be? So I called and spoke to the manager and I'm upset because I feel like it wasn't taken seriously as it should have been. I'm really saddened about my experience but unfortunately this will be my last visit."
5/7/2019,3,Get ready for you me food to take forever.  The food is very good and the boba tea is great.  The workers are nice but it just takes forever.  Every time I've gone I wait awhile.  It's quicker for food if you eat there.  Today I went to order to go.  I waited 22 minutes for a salad poke bowl and boba tea.  Another time I ordered ahead and it told me 20 which was fine I get there at 20 minutes later and got the email saying it was ready but then inside they tell me it's not and I waited 10 minutes.  There was then no point even ordering ahead.
4/5/2018,5,"The food was great! Very clean, loved the boba tea. Also enjoyed the free appetizer for checking in) Will definitely go back again!"
6/17/2016,5,"Excellent fried rice, boba tea, chicken katsu and beef bulgogi. Service was excellent! Highly recommend this place! Too bad there's no Bento Cafe in Chicago."
6/29/2018,5,"Had pad Thai and ""create your own"" veggie roll for take out. It was delicious. Plenty for two. Reasonably price. Will definitely be back."
2/9/2019,5,"Delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect and they definitely exceeded my expectations. Had the miso soup, a chicken teriyaki boul and some salad. All in all great experience."
9/7/2016,5,"We love this place. They have so many options so it's the place to go when you're craving good quality Japanese food. The bento box is jam-packed with food that will keep you satisfied for the rest of the day. So happy this is in a close location to me, making that amazing menu so accessible. The curry katsu is phenomenal!"
7/20/2017,5,"I visit Bento at least once a week. I love it. I've dined in, placed orders for pick up by phone, and placed takeout orders in person. I've never had a bad experience. They have amazing customer service. On Tuesdays, they have buy one get one free bobba tea and specials on week days between 4-6pm...like buy two sushi rolls get one free! My go to roll is the Miami roll with teriyaki sauce. I've had rice and noodle bowls as well the bento boxes. The red curry katsu is amazing. I also recommend the pineapple Thai fried rice. Like I said, I've never had something I didn't like from Bento Asian Kitchen!"
4/24/2014,5,"I was so happy to find a Bento in Orlando as it was one of my favorite places for cheap eats in Gainesville. It was just as good as I remembered. I've never had sushi from Bento, I always get their namesake bento box and it's always delicious. Curry Katsu chicken is the way to go and ginger beef is close runner-up. Not sure if my next trip will be to Orlando or Gainesville, but I know it will include a stop at Bento Cafe either way. Highly recommend!"
3/4/2018,3,"I have such a fondness (bordering on addiction) for Bento. I've been frequenting them since I was a college student back in the days when they only had the one location in Gainesville & I had friends that worked there. Then, I essentially chased them all around Florida as the new locations started popping up in Jacksonville, Tally, Orlando, & Davie. The thing is this place has all my Japanese food fave's: lots of milk tea options & toppings, customizable sushi bowls, modern casual, & young vibe. I've been to all their locations except one. At this location, the taro milk tea & pearls was very creamy & sweeter than I last remember. The spicy cream & sweet and sour chicken bento boxes were delicious & exactly like others. The dynamite roll & crunch roll were both good, but the crunch roll wasn't very warm when it came out & was practically cold after a few minutes which isnt something you want from a deep fried roll. Ordered a salmon & eel don that was perfectly fresh & tasty. While the server at this location was very sweet, she disappeared for long periods of time & the wait was rather excessive. Appetizers came out within 10-15 min but the meal took forever... at least 45 min to an hour. I had to stand up to ask for appetizer plates we never received, then sauces, and then to-go boxes... Another let down today was the the eel sauce was watery. Either way, I would still go back again & again because my love for Bento seriously runs deep."
10/19/2016,5,I've been coming to Bento Café for years and it's always great. I usually get the general Tso noodle bowl with mini udon noodles & tofu - so good! Also the seasonal zombie roll they have right now is awesome. Bento is relatively cheap for the amount of food you get. Love this place and I always come back :)
8/28/2014,4,Found this Gem on Yelp as I was driving around the area. I have expectations coming from CA. I ordered the Chirashi bowl. This chefs choice sashimi dinner was great and was presented well. The wait staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere is very young and chill. I will be coming back soon. Especially to have my sashimi fix.A suggestion would be for the sushi chefs to cut the raw fish pieces in thinner slices. It helps make it nore appealing and will help even out mouth portions during meal. Sashimi is normally served thinner to be eatten with rice. The thicker the piece the more it resembles cubed beef.
12/25/2018,5,"I enjoy coming here for the spicy cream chicken. I should of ordered on the phone since i wasn't gonna eat at the restaurant, so I had to wait for some time. Even though their system was down during that time, their staff knew how to handle each transactions."
2/27/2018,2,"Before I even begin, I've been coming to Bento's for the past 7 years or so. Over time I've realized how much has changed throughout the restaurant and as a person who throughout college worked in a restaurant, I look forward to changes in an establishment. But the changes that have been occurring at Bento Cafe is one I do not like at all.They have taken away certain sushi menu items.They use to give a discounted price for the lunch sushi bento box, but that no longer exists. They also were able to substitute the California roll out for another classic roll or could change out a classic roll and use one of the specialty rolls for an added up charge. I was always happy and willing to do that because I knew that what ever sushi that came in that bento box, I knew i was going to eat it and not have it go to waste. Now the main reason I decided to write this complain...I came in this past Sunday with my boyfriend who had only been to this establishment once before. first of all, they tell us to sit at the sushi bar and someone will be with us, but we apparently were suppose to order at the counter.. so we were waiting at the bar for a hot minute. Then when the food came out, it came out with the shrimp being tempura-ed, but nowhere next to the food item did it state it would be. My bf dislikes tempura anything and so we were disgruntled. We informed a manager and it took him FOREVER to come to us then he says he can change and it says that for the way we want it,it'll be a $1 up charge but they will take care of it. First of all, yes you were going to take care of it, and second of all, there is a way to speak to guests. The issues isn't at all about price, because we would've paid for that plus more, but the professionalism in the management team is severally lacking. Then he has the audacity to charge us for mushrooms... you just ""comped"" the redo meal and we still technically paid for the first meal that was ALL wrong, but now want us to pay for mushrooms? yeah no. At the same time as we were waiting for our meal, which took over 30 minutes, two other guests were complaining about horrible service. And then the manager has the audacity to ignore us the rest of the time and give us rude looks. How UN-professional.SERVICE is ridiculous. Corporate really needs to get this checked because my boyfriend has made it very clear that he'll never step foot into that establishment nor recommend it to anyone."
11/1/2016,4,"Good food, nice location near hotel, fast service.What more can you ask for, was surprised it was so good with the lunch rush and as busy as they were"
10/31/2015,1,"If you like good sushi that you can pay to wear with a side order of awkward interaction with your server this is the place to go!Where most servers have the common courtesy of saying, ""hello my name is"" as an introduction was lost with her. She continued the awkward silence with standing there looking at us, when anyone else would say are you ready to order? She then brought us our appetizer which was incorrect. The grand finally of this painful experience was her splattering us with soy sauce! Once again this servers lack common courtesy  only muttered,  ""oh"" then grabbed the splattered plate and went to the kitchen. After wiping ourselves off and asked for the manager we were approched by the hostes claiming she was the manager. She appologized, gave a minor bad service credit, comped us the small appetizer, then presented us with the bill. To bring this to an end, we come here often when we want good sushi. This has changed everything for us and we are telling our friends about this as well."
12/26/2016,5,Spicy cream chicken.... Enough said!You get plenty to eat with it including noodles or rice. Ask for extra sauce and pour over your noodles!
6/14/2014,5,"I love the sushi bowls at Bento! I feel like I haven't been able to get something similar to their sushi bowls anywhere else. It seems like a simple menu item but haven't found a place that has a similar taste to it. The  combination of the sushi rice flavor, wakame  salad, avocado and fish with spicy sauce is excellent! I highly recommend it. I personally like the spicy tuna and salmon don. Don't forget to check into yelp and get a free appetizer with a $10 purchase!"
6/4/2018,5,"Alright, so this is my friends and I's favorite spot when we're craving Asian food. Inside, it's a very modern environment. I used to always get the rice bowl with spicy cream chicken-- let me tell you, spicy cream is the BEST sauce and it's actually not that spicy for those who aren't a spice fan. However, as of lately I've been ordering their noodles, and I've officially turned over. SO good! Their krab wontons and sushi rolls are also a must have when you eat here."
10/6/2015,5,"Always a busy restaurant at lunchtime since you get the flow of office workers from the nearby office buildings. Get here around 11:30 or you'll be waiting. Can't go wrong with the Hot & Sour soup or the Spicy Cream with Tofu on top of mini-udon noodles. They have lots of selections and endless combos you can make and it's all catered to your taste. Service is quick and food is consistent. Once you're done eating in, just leave everything on the table and you're good to go."
12/15/2019,4,"The menu had many options. Quick turnaround on our order. We tried the poke bowl, ramen, dumplings (steamed is a must), and a few other items I can't recall. Everything was really good. We would opt for Bento over Pei Wei."
1/26/2019,3,"Writing this review as a 2 out of 5 on the hope that the food is at least good but couldn't tell you, because I've been waiting on a NOODLE BOWL WITH CHICKEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR as 3 tables behind me with a bigger party, get their food before myself. I've never had to wait so long......Update- food was average for a sushi place recommend the volcano roll, compensated for the wait with a $15 gift card... they made up for it."
9/17/2018,5,"I've been coming to this bento since I was in high school (10 year high school reunion just happened if that indicates how long it's been!) and our server, Windser, was absolutely amazing. My friend in I came in for a quick, informal birthday dinner and he was the most attentive, kind, sweetest server I'd ever had there! Wanted to take a moment to let you know what a fantastic employee you all have. He made my entire night! Thank you Windser for such a lovely evening"
10/25/2018,5,Phenomenal food and service! Sriracha garlic chicken is hands down my favorite item on the menu! I come here as often as I can! Love this place so much! Favorite spot to introduce my friends to! They've all fallen in love with it every time!
2/22/2019,1,"It took 15 min for a togo miso soup. I know it's premade. So 15 min to ladle it in a container, put a lid on it and put it on a bag."
4/16/2018,4,"The food at bento isn't supposed to be fantastic quality, for me this restaurant is made for fast Japanese style food. I feel like bento definitely does that right.. I'm a huge fan of their red curry bowl. People tend to try their sushi, but I'm not a huge fan. Their bowls are worth a try!"
8/11/2018,5,It's amazing food. I enjoyed the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl and I would definitely rate it as one of the best food in Orlando.
6/18/2019,1,"Went in for their ""free sushi"" roll today. Waited 25 min on a broken foot with no communication from the staff. When I was shoved by a server going to her table, she told me the wait was at least 45 min after you actually order your food. When I spoke with the manager she said it was at least an hour and that servers should be coming through the line to communicate. Not a single one was doing that. What a waste of time and no kind of accommodations for people who aren't able to stand.  The line is around the corner and mostly in the rain. Such a shame that a business who's been around this long doesn't know how to communicate or prepare for a large crowd when there's a promotion going on. It's not even like people get to choose what they want off the menu(everyone gets a choice of spicy tuna, Mex, or chicken tempura). Even though it's ""free"" it's a waste of time, patience, and a lack of respect towards the customer."
4/27/2015,2,"Unfortunately two stars for service and atmosphere based on multiple visits at both lunch and dinner time.The last straw was Wednesday: while waiting to put our names in for a table, a lady came barging past everyone in line saying she was going was going to put her name on the list. I politely told her that we, along the people in front of us, were waiting in line to do the same when to hostess came back. After the hostess took our names we were all told the wait was ""15 -20 min plus"" (even though half the tables were empty) because they only had 3 servers and could not sit anyone at any of the empty tables. A few minutes later the hostess comes back up front and calls not the next name on the list, but the name of the lady who tried to barge past everyone and seats her party of 3 before any of the people who have been waiting well before she got there. Another guest comments that they usually sit people of similar background before others. WTF? You get preferential seating at Bentos because you have the same ethnic background as the hostess?  There were many other groups of people who had been waiting well before we even got there got there (partys of 2, 3 & 4) who were still waiting for a table - and they did not seemed happy either that this happened. That was the last straw - we left and went next door to eat and most likely will not be back for a long while - if ever.I will say that the food is usually good, however the last time we ordered Crab Rangoons they were soaked in whatever grease they are fried in - grease literally filled the insides and leaked out when they were broken apart.  After telling the server they were not edible, he just looked at the plate and then took it and walked away. When the bill came we had to ask that they be removed from the check, to which he said we ordered them. I had to remind him that they were full of grease and in addition, we had redeemed the free Yelp appetizer offer so we should not have been charged in any event. I had to show him the Yelp app again to prove it so he would take them off the bill.Just a few other issues with service / atmosphere that add to why we will not be back:~ If you come for lunch, come early because they will have only one register open for walk in orders and the other one for call in orders. They will take individual orders for a large party then insist on giving the entire table the same number - somehow this translates into half of your party getting soup at the end of the meal, one person getting food, and the rest having to sit around until all sushi or kitchen food is ready at same time so some is cold or forgotten. One time we were told it would be a 25 minute additional wait for food (AFTER we all ordered and sat at a table) because they needed every sushi / kitchen chef to help catch up on take out orders. FYI Bentos - not everyone is a tourist and some of us need to get back to work from our lunch break. Our party woukd have gone elsewhere if we were told this upfront.~ Multiple times there have been fruit flies swarming the tables in the back which is never a good sign.~ The women's restroom used to have a small tv in an alcove advertising the specials (like in the main room)- this looks to have been literally ripped out of the wall as all that is left is an empty dusty space with cables and holes in it. It has been this way for over 6 months.~ We have seen servers napping in the back booth during slow dinner hours~ One of the booths by the side window has a major tear in the seat cushion- large enough to snag on clothing. This has been this way for close to a year, and the hostess never seems to understand why I don't want to sit there if I'm wearing a nice dress. Some duct tape would probably help if they need a cheap fix. It won't look pretty but it will prevent snagged clothing. ~ If using the free Yelp appetizer, check your bill - 9 times out of 10, you will have to remind the server to take off the appetizer.~ If dining durring happy hour, check your bill to be sure the correct HH prices were used and not the regular prices. Normally we would let some of these items go on an occasional basis, but they have become a consistent issue. Also, how hard is it to have general repairs made? If the area the public sees is like that, what does the kitchen look like?Overall, this is a shame because, as I said, the food was usually good (exception being those greasy ragoons) and it was one if the lower priced sushi options in the Restaurant Row area. However, there are many other places to get sushi (and be seated in the order you came in)."
4/24/2018,4,"Have loved Bento since living in Gainesville even before they opened up their Orlando locations.  My favorite entrees are the Szechuan chicken and the red curry chicken as a noodle bowl or a bento box.  For those unfamiliar with the box, it usually contains green beans, ginger salad, lo mein noodles, white rice and a dessert.  I also enjoy their boba tea from time to time.  They can get busy in the evenings when it turns into a sit down restaurant so plan on getting there before you turn hangry."
9/12/2016,1,"Took 30 min at the register to find Hamachi Kama item, then they charged us double for that (they put different item in it , price was 15$) been eating this item over 3 years never paid 15$ (8$ some changes) our server Silvia came back told us that it's what it is , ( she went to her young asian looking manager , and manager didn't even bother herself to come and talk to us to  find a solution, she just ignored us and start texting )  we decided to return that order and get our money back ! Never will be back in to this location! Downtown location you are only one that I ever will go , IF I GO AGAIN !!!!! Thank you for great memories Sand Lake Location.Tips for owners- pls train your managers before putting them on the floor , if you don't want to loose all your customers! ( I was spending in Bento locations weekly around 200$) NEVER AGAIN!"
12/2/2018,5,"I really enjoy my meal every time I come here. The sushi bowls are my favorite, I usually get one of the house specials like spicy tuna, or I make my own with the many choices of delicious options. I am also a sucker for the boba teas, I can't figure out why such a strange drink is so tasty. I just took the whole family and even the kids found food they really liked (fried rice, grilled chicken)."
11/17/2015,5,"Best Sushi in town! Mount Fuji and special Mexican are my favorite! I love the staff they are all so nice! Special thanks to Jade, Jessica, Carrie, John, Kevin, Ray! For making me feel like family :) the only thing I'd change about this place is their water as it taste like lake water!"
6/27/2016,3,"Amazing as usual. My szechuan beef noodle soup was great!! My cousin's sriracha garlic chicken was good.But the spicy creamy shrimp was a BIG disappointment. I remember back in the college days of Gainesville UF & post-college eating at this location the shrimp was normal sized and delicious. I don't know what they did, or if it's because of food cost/economy, the shrimp inside the breading has become micro-sized. Literally barely any shrimp for the size of breading. I hope this gets corrected."
5/11/2018,5,"It's our first night in Orlando... we came here and had a wonderful experience! The service was great, especially our waiter Winderson was AWESOME! He took really good care of us. One of our family members didn't like the dish that was turned out, but Winderson was so patiently helping us! Highly recommended!"
11/8/2018,2,"I honestly prefer the Downtown Orlando location. Downtown has much better service, quality of the food is different and the sauces are FREE.The location at Sand Lake just coming in the floors are sticky, tables are as well and the smell is bad as soon as you sit down."
10/12/2017,4,"Decent vegan options, but make sure to ask your server since a lot of the sauces have fish in them. I was told by the helpful server that on the entree menu the Red Curry, Yellow Curry, Sesame Soy and Sriracha Garlic were the only vegan sauces. That being said, we ordered the Red Curry and Sriracha Garlic rice bowls with Tofu. They were both pretty good, I think I like the Sriracha Garlic and fried tofu better though and will get that if I go back. The Red Curry was good too, but after almost devouring the whole thing I noticed what looked like a small bristle in my bowl. It could have been a piece of my chopsticks?Or maybe the from the snow peas? After seeing that I noticed more little pieces and wasn't able to figure out what it was so I stopped eating it. I'd go back and try something different, but I'll be searching for those bristles the whole time! There were a lot of fingerprints on the front door like they hadn't cleaned in a month which kinda made me want to wash my hands before I even sat down. Overall though, service was amazing, and food tasted good, just needed a little detailed cleaning."
10/29/2018,5,My Girlfriend and I came here for Dinner last Night and I was Highly impressed. I don't care for Sushi but they had other Menu options and I can't wait to come back !
4/4/2015,2,"I have been this place's one of the best customers last 5 years. To be honest very good quality sushi with great prices. I try to eat here almost twice a week but unfortunately something going on here last couple of months. You can easily see that quality of service was descending. Today (Saturday 7 pm) which is prime time for restaurants, i came to eat with 5 people. They do not have COKE to drink which they say out of stock, NO Silverware (no fork no spoon) to eat, and NO plates. Also NO Lobster to use in the specific sushis. This is on Saturday evening. Are you kidding me? It looks like a joke but correct."
7/31/2018,5,"This place is always a staples for my mother and I. Great food but this particular visit our server William was absolutely amazing he was extraordinarily kind, wellmannered, and provided over the top service. He should be where the bar is set for all wait staff in restaurants. Kudos William and thanks for the great service! Returning for he food and William's service next week!"
12/7/2015,4,"I have been to this location several times and have always left happy. I really enjoy the crab wontons and have ordered several different sushi rolls. The sushi rolls are very fresh and tasty, not the absolute best I have ever had, but still very good. I have tried the bento boxes, sushi combo, and a noodle bowl or two. The value is excellent.This is one of the few sushi places I have gone to that I feel is truly family-friendly. I have an 11 month old who likes to yell out of happiness, smile and stare at people in neighboring booths, and drop a snack or five on the ground. Every time we have come here, there have been several families dining with young children and it is pretty nice to be able to relax and not worry about bothering other patrons.Get a boba tea to go and check in on Yelp for a free app!"
3/20/2013,2,"We just had a very disappointing experience at this location.  This was our 3rd or 4th visit, and we probably won't be back.  By far the worst part was my husband's dish.  He ordered the steak teriyaki bowl with white rice and broccoli.  The rice was just horrible.  It was very dry and overly chewy, it was either old, not cooked properly, or both.  I didn't try the steak, but my husband said it was tough and bland.  The service was also disappointing.  We were seated pretty quickly and didn't wait long for our dishes, but upon receiving our plates our server never, ever checked back.  My husband wanted a fork instead of chop sticks but our server was either at another table or behind the register on the other side of the restaurant.  Every other server who briskly walked by didn't once make eye contact with us so, he was stuck with the chop sticks.  I had to grab soy sauce off of another table because I knew there wasn't going to be any brought at any time.  Our server did come by the table once, but we were done eating.  She brought the check and after waiting waiting for her to pick it up and bring back changed we decided to leave what cash we had which was a slightly lower tip than originally planned, but in retrospect seems fair.  It's also worth noting, that when we got our drinks, I asked for some sugar packets for my tea and was told the restaurant was out of sugar, they only had sweet n low.  This was not my first bad service experience at this restaurant but the first time the food was unacceptable as well.  They have gotten my sushi order right each time however, but based on this most recent experience, I don't think I will ever go back."
1/14/2016,4,"I have been here several times and all my friends love Bento. I really enjoy it too, everything tastes fresh, and it is a quick and good-priced place to eat. I'm not too crazy about their teriyaki bowls, but my friends love it. I've had the pad Thai a few times and it's decent as well. There are tons of healthy options here which are great too."
9/25/2019,5,If you want good Asian food that's made quick...I suggest Bento. Good food and for a decent price.
1/29/2016,4,"Service is still oooohhh soooo slooooowww.  But I found a way around it, just order pick up! New Bento favorites -- Curry Katsu and Spicy Cream.  A++For bubble tea -- On tuesdays, it's BOGO (buy one, get one)!  And don't forget to get their boba card which entitles you to one free bubble tea after you buy a certain number of bubble teas."
1/12/2010,4,"Great VALUE and tons of CHOICES!  You get a lot more than you would at other Asian/ethnic casual restaurants.  A lot of sides and the bento box is great for a take out lunch to take back to the office.I went on a slow Monday night and they were experimenting on the ""full-table-service"" versus their original order at the counter format. Not sure if they are going to stick with the full service but I hope they don't raise prices to go full service.If anyone is a ""boba"" or ""bubble tea"" fan they serve them there too!"
3/1/2018,3,"I loved the Bento in Gainesville and was pretty good when I came to this location a couple of years ago. But I've been twice in the past three months and it's just lacking. Both times they were out of the noodles that go in pad thai, and the items I got were just ok. I'd go back to Bento if someone I'm with wanted to go, but it definitely hasn't been a memorable experience lately."
7/24/2019,4,The food is consistently freshly made and tasty.  This is our go to in Dr Phillips for shrimp fried rice.
6/3/2018,2,"Foods good but not the best in the area for the style also I went in once for bubble tea and they didn't have boba, so I asked I'd be paying less since I wasn't getting full product and the girl ringing me up rolled her eyes at me and charged me full price. That's annoying to me as most places boba cost extra. There's it comes with the drive but if it's not with the drink why should I pay the same price for just milk tea then milk tea with boba. Also I wasn't told there wasn't Boba until after it was made, so I wasn't given the option to change my mind about it, I mean I guess I could have rejected the drink but I felt bad because it was already made"
5/29/2018,5,The food here is amazing and quick. The employees are always professional. This is one of my favorite places to eat with family and friends.
5/25/2015,4,"Reliably good sushi for fair prices. Happy hour prices go from 4-7, and during that time you can get buy two get one free rolls! I go, load up on eel rolls, and leave a happy camper. I haven't had luck with their fried dumplings, they always come out a little hard. But their sushi rice is on point, which is more than I can say for some places around here."
8/30/2015,5,"First reaction when walking in... Casual, friendly staff and a relax ambiance. Great option if you are in the mood to grab and go or enjoy a relaxing afternoon/evening. Recommend the Mount Fuji roll and the bento box give you a variety of options to choose from."
8/4/2018,5,"Come on a regular basis. Quick, fresh, and inexpensive quality food. Walk up service for lunch and table service for dinner. Usually busy but worth the wait."
10/11/2018,5,Boba!!! My very first time drinking this amazingness of popping flavor! Say whhhat!! Def coming back for this delish beverage!
3/18/2015,3,"Took a trip to Bento Cafe as it was the closest ""decent"" Asian place from the conference hotel we were staying at.  To get the full ""asian experience,"" I tried the dumplings, sushi, pad thai and bubble tea.  The dumplings were average and tasted store bought.  I ordered them fried and the whole thing was deep fried giving it an oily and crispy-ish taste.  i definitely prefer my dumplings to be pan fried so it wasn't for me.The sushi was decent.  I ordered the eel and they did not skimp on the eel.  Pretty decent choiceThe strangest part of the meal was the pad thai - the noodles were not the rice noodles that i'd expect and I hardly tasted the fish sauce.  Instead it was a combination of soy and lemon?  I wouldn't want that again.The bubble tea was the best part of the meal.  Tea based, and good texture and sweetness on the bubbles.  A solid three stars."
12/23/2013,5,"I came here to eat with my girlfriend for lunch one day. And can I just say that I love this place? The atmosphere felt great and very welcoming. The staff seems very friendly and attentive. During the weekdays, they have a special called the Sushi Combo Box, I believe, ad it's basically four California Rolls, and then your choice of two different rolls, both four a piece. So a total of 12 for about $10. We also had Milk Tea with Pearls (Boba), also very good. We've decided to make this our new regular place to eat."
4/8/2018,5,"Bento has become a favorite of mine over the years. The food is prepared fresh and is always delicious. They are responsive to requests and the staff is always respectful. Whether I order their sushi, boba, or noodle bowls, I'm never disappointed. I also like the casual vibe of the restaurant. It's a great place to bring friends and family."
6/3/2015,5,I love the beef bulgogi!! The chicken katsu is really good as well. I always get the bento box special. I asked for extra vegetables instead of the salad. I'm not a fan of ginger dressing. I love the tempura green beans. There's always a little piece of cake too! The service is fast and friendly. It's cheap and the decor is really nice!
7/1/2018,4,Had to drop this to 4 stars as I was hassled about using this yelp check in bonus to get my appetizer. I've checked into here dozens of times and always get the edamame and this time I'm told I will be charged extra and that it's always been that way? I'm not one to make up things to save a few bucks. I'm too tired after a long day to continue to argue with these people.
3/13/2012,4,"This became an instant favorite the first time I came here. The check-in offer of a free appetizer with $10 purchase didn't hurt either. The appetizer that my friend and I settled on was the Steam Chicken Dumplings. As a dumpling fanatic, I was quite impressed and the sauce they were sitting in was delicious.So far, I've had the Soy Chili Chicken Noodle bowl and the Spicy Korean Beef Bento Box. Both were great and a good portion-size for less than $10 each. It's definitely a great value for what you're getting. I haven't had the sushi so I'm unable to comment on that, but the service and atmosphere are great. It might be lacking a bit of authenticity as far as Asian cuisine goes, but I think the intent is Pan-Asian fusion. In that respect, it certainly succeeds.When it's all said and done, this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck places in Orlando. If you have a craving for good Pan-Asian cuisine that won't break the bank, I highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't already."
5/10/2015,5,"Without a doubt my favorite Asian food place! The best sushi and prices around, plus very friendly wait staff.  They have a normal sushi happy hour m-f 4-7pm where you buy two rolls, get one free. This plus the garlic edamame is always a great filler for two, even the wok fried dumplings if you want a bit of a kick !The mt.fuji roll, special Mexican, Gucci roll and create a roll (seriously, make your own sushi!), are among our favorites. The Korean noodle bowl and spicy cream bowl are also amazing options to grab. If you're In a hurry, the bento box (sushi or entree version ) are a great way to get some great samples of everything this place has to offer.I never pass up a chance to get good sushi, and this place really knows what their doing, along with a great staff that know their menu! This has been a long favorite place of mine and will always be a staple in my go to places."
10/27/2015,5,"Good sushi at a good price?! Hard to find, but this place is it.We come usually for happy hour, or dinner take out. Both instances the place is great. First, their happy hour is full of options from 2 for 1 sushi, free appetizers, and drink specials. The sushi is really well presented, and we'll made. Not too big or small of a bite. Definitively a good, quick spot to get sushi."
6/6/2018,5,Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. The cuisine is pan-Asian and the menu consists of all kinds of cooked and raw foods. I ordered a bento combo box. The sushi quality exceeds the price. Service was also really friendly and quick. This is one of my favorite casual pan-Asian restaurants in Orlando!
12/30/2017,4,This is a really nice restaurant both to do as dine-in but also as Uber Eats. Great restaurant with good food and really nice staff. The sushi is really good and decently priced. The chicken curry wasn't really my thing (but I'm picky on curry). Definitely worth a try if you haven't been
11/8/2014,4,"Great spot to go for Asian food, I love their sushi rolls and bento boxes. You have to try the spicy creamy chicken, you won't regret it. I almost always get it. Don't forget to have some sake with your meal!"
12/1/2016,1,"I have been to this place many times and have always had a fantastic experience. Recently, I went and I ordered my Ahi Tuna, which normally takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the table. This time, it was at my table just two minutes after I sat down, which most would think is great service, but looking back makes me think it had been sitting out for someone else. Fast forward 4 hours - I am violently ill with food poisoning. I am not one to complain. I called their management to let them know, I don't even want compensation, just acknowledgment that they will look into it. They said someone would be in touch, and three days later, I have still heard nothing from them. Goes to show how seriously they take things like this..."
5/2/2018,5,Always love coming here. The sushi is great and the customizable meals are the best at a great price. Oh and if you love boba tea come here on Tuesdays for buy one get one! Also big shoutout to Echo who made date night with my boyfriend amazing. She was super attentive and gave great suggestions on teas. Highly recommend!
8/25/2019,4,"Took my family to Orlando for vacation. Found this place on yelp. It was pretty nice. Food was good. Quantity was good. Price was good. You order, pay and then find your own seat."
9/26/2019,5,Katie really made my first experience at Bento's amazing. She was extremely welcoming and helpful with the menu. Her service went beyond standards and her energy is too high to just be behind a counter. The food wasn't that delicious but this interaction made up for it. Thank you!
1/21/2015,5,"It can be very crowded at night, around wkds the wait is usually at least half an hour. But it's all worthwhile for my absolute fav dish: spicy cream chicken!!!"
8/18/2019,1,This has really gone down hill. Came in for dinner. So disappointing tables and floor was filthy. Employees not cleaning areas. Couldn't find a seat that was clean to eat. Use to be a great clean place..
1/6/2015,4,"Every time I've been here, it's always been take out so I can't comment on service. Their spicy cream chicken is heaven in your mouth. I always pay for extra with my white rice because I feel like what it comes with as is isn't as satisfying.I usually get Thai tea boba (no slush here)& it's usually good. However, one time, this girl must have been new because she made my tea where my condensed milk was literally floating in the top and just chillin' at the bottom of it. When I asked why it looked like that, some guy said ""we changed the 'formula'"". When really, she probably but the ice in before the milk so it couldn't dissolve. I took a sip of all condensed milk and I asked for a different drink and she had attitude but I already put money in the tip jar so I wasn't going to leave without a well-made drink. Royale tea was okay, but again, careful who makes your tea."
5/8/2019,2,"I really hate to write this negative review because as far as food goes it's a solid 4! Very yummy and flavorful dishes! However yesterday my husband and I decided to go on a lunch date here. The girl at the register (dirty blonde hair in a side braid, I don't know her name) was nasty rude. I have a service dog, he is an alert dog to PTSD episode that cause me to black out of conciseness something I shouldn't have to explain. He is very vital for me being able to go out and function. Well before we can even begin to order she gives me this incredibly dirty look and asks ""you're sitting on the patio correct?"". My husband jumps in to respond no we are going to take a booth inside. I also add he is a service dog. She then continues her dirty glares as we order. Making me feel very uncomfortable. I sit down and notice other employees are also giving me dirty looks. It's very hard for me to go out in public and to be treated like this is just unacceptable and heart breaking. I truly hope this review is taken seriously and training is put in place so that this treatment is not continued. But on another note I want to say Kelly who delivered our food is an absolute delight! She is so friendly and bubbly! Just a wonderful shinning light! Maybe she can teach the others how to conduct themselves in a customer service based setting. She deserves a raise!"
5/30/2019,5,"I was really in the mood for ramen during my visit to Orlando, but everything was so far or closed at that time of night. I was in the mood to try something new. I decided on sushi instead and came across Bento. I ordered a Japanese Bagel roll and a bento box (coconut curry chicken, white rice, ginger salad, and green beans). Everything was sooo good especially the coconut curry chicken!"
10/30/2012,4,This bento is a bit more fancier than the one in Gainesville yet a little more causal than the one located downtown. The food was still pretty good. When I went it wasn't busy so I had no problem with not getting any help. It's a very modern cafe with a cool vibe of a modern and traditional japanese restaurant.The food was pretty good and I think the servings are always hefty. I love getting the bento box because there's such a variation of things to eat and absolutely love the green beans! The garlic edamame is pretty darn good too but it's very strong and garlicy!
7/11/2017,5,"Tons of delicious options (including vegan) with prompt, friendly service. Jade provides exceptional customer service, even if you're placing a catering order."
11/18/2017,5,"I don't get to come here often but when I do it's an absolute delight. The food and tea are wonderful (I'm a tea/boba snob) and it passed my tests. The service goes above expectations. I always forget to order my food without onions and when I made a comment about it, like ""oops, I forgot again."" a server (Winderson) was incredibly helpful in getting the food remade even as I said to not let it be an inconvenience. Always excited to come here!"
7/31/2016,1,Extremely slow service and they weren't even busy.   Would not return here.   The chicken was overcooked and the sauce/curry was not spicy enough.
7/27/2015,5,"Hands down, one of the best sushi quality I've had. The menu has a great selection of appetizers, sushi rolls, entrees, and teas. And for the price, you can't beat it! Definitely visiting this place again. Overall very modern, clean and friendly staff; that's always a plus!!"
7/13/2019,1,"Consistently slow and terrible service, regardless of when you come. It's Saturday, just past 3 pm (so there's neither a lunch or a dinner rush) and the restaurant is empty. After more than 10 minutes of waiting for just my hot tea, I went to ask why it was taking so long. The woman working the food line told me rather rudely that she couldn't find me and that's why I didn't have my tea. That's strange, because I received a number to take to my table, so they clearly just didn't bother to look. By this time, my hot tea was room temperature. My food order, which was one dish that didn't require cooking, came 25 minutes after my order was placed. Why it took so long when the place is empty and there are three sushi chefs working, I don't know. But this basically happens every time I come here. I tried calling in my order ahead, but good luck with that. They just say please hold, and put you on hold before you can say anything. I ended up holding for more than 5 minutes each time, and no one came back on the line to take my order. So I just went somewhere else those times because I couldn't be bothered. It's like the management here just doesn't want to make money, because these are easy fixes, and would prevent them from losing customers. This is my last time here."
8/31/2017,3,"A decent asian fast food place. I ordered a customized poke bowl, it was pretty good. Although they gave me too much soy and it was a little bit too salty."
1/27/2018,1,"Looked online and checked they were open and would close at 11pm, wanted a delivery so I decided to try Uber eats, was placing my order and had already chosen a few items, when suddenly at 10:12 the app was not accepting orders for this restaurant anymore. Called the restaurant and they said they turned off the app because it was close to closing time, seriously? Then why say you receive orders till 11pm on the app? VERY DISAPOINTED"
1/24/2018,4,"I'm here at least once a week for lunch, sometimes there is hardly a wait and others you wait 30 minutes. The main reason this review is 4 stars is frequently during the lunch rush they run out of forks. Seems like a crazy problem for a place that knows they will have a lunch rush. Highly recommend the food. I love the sushi, they are accommodating for any substitution of protein. I also really enjoy the pad Thai but the portion is huge it usually gets me lunch and dinner."
2/15/2015,5,"Came here for lunch with coworkers to celebrate Valentine's Day. Their sushi lunch special is two classic rolls, a California roll, seaweed salad, and a cucumber salad thing for $8.95. Not a bad deal at all! I got the krab delight and Alaskan rolls and I was happy overall with my purchase. What surprised me was how many options there are with all of the different Asian flavors. We all got something different: one got curry, one got a rice bowl of sorts with raw salmon, several got the sushi special, and one got another bowl of sorts. There's no shortage of options and it seems that the prices are comparable to other sushi places.  I feel like I got a bit more bang for my buck here though bc I ended up with 12 pieces of sushi in the special, whereas most places I get 8-10 if I'm lucky. I will be back again to bring my SO along!"
8/27/2015,3,"Pretty good. Ordered the bulgogi noodle bowl. Arrived warm, not hot. The beans were overcooked and cold. The noodles were greasy like you get a little dumpy Chinese place in a bad strip mall. The bulgogi beef was really good. More of that sauce/marinade should have been on the noodles. Got beef fried rice. Meh. Underwhelming.Pros:- bulgogi good- open later then Pei Wei- reasonable price (if you don't want to sub fried in for white rice)- comfortable atmosphere (NOT posh, as another reviewer mentions)Cons:- cold food- overcooked veggies- not enough bulgogi sauce- meh fried riceSome of these issues could just be the night (like cold food), but on a previous visit we got cold overcooked edamame)."
10/13/2017,5,Nicole was a fantastic server. Really enjoyed our meal. I'm gluten intolerant and Nicole was super great about making sure nothing I got had gluten in it.
12/31/2017,3,I was very disappointed with visiting my favorite restaurant while i was on vacation. I went two times within a 4 day period just because its my favorite restaurant. The first time i went i waited over an hour for my food. Sushi was left out so the rice was mushy and no good. I got my spicy kream bowl and was a decent bowl but not enough shrimp. The second time i went i was disappointed with the teriyaki steak noodle bowl. The steak was too chewy and the teriyaki was too runny and didn't stick to the steak.
5/21/2014,5,"Absolutely love Bento Cafe!! Between the fun and trendy atmosphere, extensive (and very delicious) menu offerings, reasonable pricing, generous portions, and friendly service - I highly recommend this restaurant!Some of my faves are fried chicken dumplings, Cantonese pork chop on rice, Szechuan beef noodle soup, Mt. Fuji roll, salmon skin roll, dragon roll, thrilla in manila kawaii roll, and don't forget the taro milk tea with pearls.The Yelp check-in offer is just the cherry on top :)."
3/30/2015,5,"I've been coming to Bento Cafe for years - since they opened! I'm not ashamed to say that I always get the same items every time I come. They've been so consistent throughout the years. I highly recommend the dumplings! So delicious and piping hot, fried or steamed. Probably the best in Orlando. The shrimp tempura rice bowl is my go-to dish; very filling. My favorite sushi rolls are the Mt. Fuji and the Masarap (which means delicious in Tagalog). It is usually quick casual for lunch and they switch to table service for dinner. Get there during happy hour for their 'buy 2 rolls and get 1 free' promo. But do try to finish it because you can't take leftover happy hour sushi home. I tried :(Yes, it can get crowded on some nights so expect a wait on the sushi. One night we came, our server warned us upfront that the wait for sushi was 45 minutes, which was insane but it was a Saturday night. At least we were warned.Everything is reasonably priced and service is always satisfactory. I will continue to come back!"
8/20/2017,4,Good food. I would recommend the spicy creamy chicken. Order was messed up but the server apologized and made it better.
4/29/2017,5,"Great sushi! Service is good, and normally you don't have to wait long for your order. Lunch is counter service, dinner and Sunday lunch is table service.  I recommend the sushi combo box- the Mt Fuji roll and Special Mexican roll are my favorites. I've also had the sweet and sour chicken bowl and that was delicious too!  Give it a try. My only criticism is I wish they opened before noon!  No sushi lunch at 11:30 ."
5/30/2014,4,"I had wonderful service when I came here. As a sushi snob, I liked that I was able to create my own roll with a combination of ingredients that fit my taste buds. If you're like me and tend to be picky with your sushi rolls, I recommend you to do the same - make your own roll."
10/9/2017,5,Had my first ever poke bowl from there- it was excellent. The tuna was fresh and flavorful. I also enjoyed that you can order half rolls of sushi. Great quality- especially for the price.
1/3/2017,3,"Not the best but not the worst.  Definitely a ""fast food"" style of sushi.  For families / friends with sushi-leary kids/friends, the menu includes noodle and rice heavy meal bowls too.  The restaurant itself was clean and organized.  If you are looking for super casual mixed Asian style fast-fare, this is your place.  If you are looking for a high quality sushi experience, skip it."
3/26/2017,5,Fav casual place for sushi . Lunch is run much better then dinner . I like ordering at counter and then picking where I would like to sit . Usually a waiting list for dinner . The food is good overall and reasonable prices
8/27/2011,3,"Bento Cafe sets the tone for an urban and contemporary cafe which serves quick casual sushi and Pan Asian Cuisine. The interior is very modern with tones of black and red. There are striking red columns hanging from the high ceiling. The side tables have a beautiful calming inserted glass box with rocks and petals.  There is the proverbial sushi cases and a corner counter dedicate for take out.Upon entry there is an empty greeter stand with quite a few staff walking around. A less than excited staff walked over nonchalantly, grabbed menus, and motioned to follow. What if we just wanted take out? Picky, picky. For a place with such a high server to table ratio, it took forever for a server to greet us. While there were several staff standing around more interested in their own bubble than a guest. When the server did decide to come over, she was cordial but very impersonal. She did offer to explain the menu. But when asked for a menu item that defined Bento Cafe, the standard non familiar answer of ""they are all good"" flew out of her mouth. Although it was early evening of a weekend day, it did not seem like anyone was really happy to be there. No smiles nor acknowledgments.The sushi rice was soft, mushy, and extra sticky. Sushi roll pieces stuck together. Sashimi were still cold in the middle. The fish was not sliced completely through as they hung together. The ""white fish"" or tilapia blood line was not removed leaving that all too familiar fishy odor. The booba balls were a mixture of fresh and not so fresh, some were chewy while others were little rocks. The glass of Moscato di Asti was completely flat.For the price and swanky neighborhood, this place should deliver a higher caliber of food and service. Not because the restaurant is billed as ""quick casual"" it means ""quick sloppy"". There are still certain basic elements of service and food preparation that should follow any restaurant. Especially in a sushi restaurant."
5/8/2019,2,Came here 7-10 times before and checked in and received a free small appetizer and today now I guess the rule has changed. You must dine-in to receive the free 3.00 Appetizer....
4/12/2017,4,This was great for a casual date night. I really enjoyed my food and the vibe the place has . Will definitely be back!
11/8/2015,5,"Delicious! We come here all the time. I love their boba and rice bowls!! The service is good, but come on a sunday or a weekday if you want to avoid a crowd. It  is a very popular place, and the wait can be awhile if it is a busy night. They do have takeout as well, if you need to order quickly."
10/29/2017,5,"I consistently love this place and come every few weeks. They are great for lunch and dinner. I enjoy their sushi and rice bowls; noodle bowls, bento boxes and poke are available too. I have their crab wontons app every time I'm there and they never disappoint. The beef bulgogi is frequent choice of mine and I love it. You can get only 4 sushi rolls with some varietys (or 8 or 10 with all), which is nice as a light meal, app, or if you just want a taste. Prices for everything are totally reasonable and sometimes they have coupons with Yelp. Dinner has servers and is full service, while lunch is more fast casual. They do takeout too. You can get brown rice if you want - for bowls or sushi. Service is OK; sometimes they get bogged down if busy, but they definitely take care of you. Absolutely recommend to anyone liking Asian food."
11/25/2014,4,"You can't beat this place. The food is great, fast, cheap and good service. The bento box is recommended. Salad, your choice of meat, noodles, rice, a vegetable (usually broccoli or green beans) then a small dessert. Sometimes you seat yourself and order at the counter and they bring you the food and you get your own drinks, or it is full table service. I generally see the table service come into play around dinner time.... However there doesn't seem to be too much consistency as I have had both at all different times. REGARDLESS - who cares right? It's a restaurant. We are there for good food. You won't be disappointed."
9/25/2014,3,"A true fusion restaurant.  It sounds like a Japanese spot until you look at the menu.  They have serve Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food.  I am not a fan of fusion restaurants, but this was the only place that opened late.The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nice.  There were TVs everywhere and the football game was on (BONUS).  Keep in mind that I was getting over a fever and all I  wanted was some noodle soup to make myself feel better.  If you check in via yelp, you get a free appetizer with purchase of $10 or more.  Kelly ordered the teriyaki bento box and I ordered a spicy beef noodle soup (basically a pho).  I feel that teriyaki bento box is pretty standard anywhere you go.  Nothing to brag about.  The spicy beef noodle soup was pretty good.  The soup was flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  I asked for ramen noodle with it and there was an up charge for it. that was fine. The food was not bad at all. It was much needed since the only thing I hate that day was medicine and water.I wish I had the stomach to try some sashimi and check out the quality. Oh well."
3/11/2016,5,very good inexpensive food. used yelp coupon to get free Gyoza (Pork dumplings)
7/21/2014,3,"The service was ok. The restaurant was on the louder side, which the server did not compensate for. So, when he spoke, I would have to lean in a bit more. However, the food was good. The Edamame was a bit surprising with the salt added onto the shell. I had the Rainbow Roll, which was satisfying. I would suggest it, perhaps earlier in the day."
6/5/2014,1,"Says check in for $10 off but their free Wifi doesn't work and when you ask they just tell you their must be too many people on when clearly not one person has their phone out.   They increased their prices without changing their menus and when confronted with it they just said it was an error on the menu. SO FIX IT!!  Then the server brought out my companions food, took the table # and apparently left mine sitting for pick up until 20 min later when I asked where mine was. All I got was a sorry.  One of the worst service experiences I have ever encountered. There are better sushi places on restaurant row. I would skip this one if I were you."
1/19/2014,1,"I haven't tried the food but the bobba teas are powdered grossness. I love bobba and thought I'd try a new place. When I arrived, I was excited to see the variety on their menu. I was at once disappointed though to see them scooping powders to mix my strawberry shortcake. Although I still planned to drink it, one sip changed my mind. Tasted like too many scoops of Nestle quick. Yuck!"
12/19/2015,1,"Update 12/22: The district manager contacted me and resolved the issue. Though I wouldn't return to this location, Bento usually delivers stellar service at any of its other locations. Looking forward to a better experience.Original review: Though the wait was very minimal and we got sat quickly, the rest is short of a nightmare. The reason we came to this restaurant was because of Yelp offer and the hot sake! However, upon sitting down and asking for hot sake, we were told they were out. So we asked to have Kirin light, which turns out they didn't have. We settled for the Kirin Ichiban. We ordered a Philly roll and asked that smoked salmon be changed to regular salmon. She took the order and then came back and said there was going to be an up-charge. Though any other time I would've been okay with it, I felt appalled that after being inconvenienced twice it should at least be disregarded. I called for the manager, which came in a hostile disposition. She had her hands folded and looked like she was gonna cry from the irate look on her face. I explained the confusion and she mentioned that it was company policy and that the least she could do is discount the beer... (Side note the discount for the beer would've been the same as the up-charge...I digress). But right after she mentioned, ""you threaten the server"", appalled I responded, ""I did what?"", she responded, ""you told the staff that you were going to review us on Yelp"". I clarified, ""that is not a threat, that is what I usually do when I go to a restaurant""... Make a long story short at the end she said, ""We target a certain type of customers and you may not be one of them"". With that said we requested to leave and she said don't worry about the beer, that were barely drank! Overall, the manager could've handled the situation so much better. Her calling a review a threat was beyond ridiculous, people review, that's not a threat but a fact. Her initial interaction and her final remarks were both unprofessional and quite derogatory. The offer to discount the beer would've been suffice however her emotions lead the conversation which prompted this lovely review. I hope for future patrons, you are able to coach to your teams ability to identify a threat and how to better handle customers who are not pleased with the service. Manager: Andrein"
8/4/2015,5,Love sushi I will come back any day againI had a nice visit this timeI'm so happy I give it a second chance I can't complain this time .........................
2/1/2015,5,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner despite the service reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. This was the first time at this restaurant for the both of us and everything was great from the food to the service. He had a teriyaki beef bento box, I had the shrimp tempura on a rice bowl and we split a sushi combo box - it was A LOT of food (very generous portions) for a great price. All in all we will definitely be visiting again. Great food, service and atmosphere."
11/21/2016,5,"So much to choose from, and such good sushi! I had the combo and it was the perfect amount of sushi for me. Can't wait to go back!"
2/18/2019,1,"Unprofessional treatment of customers and terrible attitude of so called ""manager"" Alex (to describe him more specifically: very unpleasant appearance with massive green piercing in his ears). I am a frequent customer who used to come to Bento almost every week for a year, and I've never been so disrespected. He overcharged me without even checking if the product is even available, which turned out that it wasn't, and then when I said ""don't worry about the refund - I'll be back next week and I'll just grab a bottle of water then."" He started telling me it's unrealistic, interrupted me, snapped and started raising his annoying voice being very sharp and disrespectful to me. Maybe he forgot that the customer is always right? Especially a very, very frequent one? I used to love Bento, but I now feel extremely disrespected and disappointed. For my own money, some uneducated person in customer service is interrupting, raising his voice, being rude and telling me he doesn't like me, especially after he made a mistake on top of everything! A manager doesn't act like this. He should be fired."
7/27/2019,3,"My boyfriend and I come to this place pretty often, and we noticed one of your staff that's a host, I think her name is Taylor. On July 27th @9:50pm, we ordered food to go, and the way she handled the call was very unprofessional. Not only did she not even actually put us on hold when she said she would, allowing us to hear everything she was gossiping about to her coworker; she also took a long time to confirm our order. She did not even properly end the call, just randomly hanging up without saying when the order could be picked up. When we picked up our order, and saw how much the bill was, and thinking about how she carelessly took our order over the phone, we seriously considered not tipping at all; we wound up tipping 18% to still be considerate. The last time that we ate there, she gave us a dirty look for no apparent reason when we ordered boba. We do feel like the quality of service is diminishing drastically at this location. We consider ourselves regular costumers, and as such we simply expect quality service from every employee. Please do take note of this!"
2/13/2019,5,Echo was the absolute best server ever! We were setting up our friend's first date and she helped us with it. Definitely 10/10 for maxing Guest Service!!
9/5/2016,4,Bento Cafe is an excellent choice for an Asian lunch if you are in the Dr. Phillip's area.  The sushi here knocks Publix sushi out of the park.  The only complaint is the combo doesn't include both miso soup and ginger salad.  I will be coming back soon.
1/6/2014,4,"Bento has never done me wrong! Their food is always on point, I've never had a negative experience here. There's not much of an ""experience"" when dining here, which is fine with me, I'm usually here for a quick meal or to meet up with friends before we head out somewhere else. It's perfect for a light but filling meal. My favorites: Fried cheese wantons, spicy tuna rolls, and the Volcano rolls.xx MJ"
3/5/2015,5,I love this place! Much better than downtown location if you ask me. The price is Great for the amazing cuisines that you get. Me and family's personal favorite dish is Spicy cream! Not spicy at all though for you spice lovers but it's awesome! My favorite Sushi roll is Mt.Fuji roll :-P
2/9/2016,2,"I normally like to go to Bento Cafe but today was one of those days where the employees were totally disorganized! Normally there are 2 cashiers at the order desk, one left and took a long time getting back. I asked the other guy where was the cashier because the line was getting long. He didn't answer. Then he forgot to give me my cup. Annoyed!"
1/13/2019,5,Jayson at Bento is great! Super sweet and accommodating. Wonderful service and absolutely love Bento's sushi! Always a good choice!
4/12/2017,5,I love this place. The atmosphere is relax. The quality of the food and quantity is great for the price. The food is fresh and delicious. Had lunch in different occasions and jad the bento box and sushi box. Both are amazing!
1/22/2017,3,"My BF and I have ordered the same exact order about twice a month for 2 years. We work from home around the corner, and we call it in and pick it up. The food is good, and we will continue to eat there, but the order is NEVER correct. It use to really irritate us, not its just comical. Not ONCE has our order ever been how we ordered it. I worked in the restaurant industry for 12 years, so I know a complicated order when I see it. Our order is nothing complicated.  I addressed this with the manager one time so she put our order together to make sure it was correct. Got home, and there's no soy sauce or chop sticks in the bag. Just funny at this point."
4/12/2016,5,I've been here a couple of times already and the food never disappoints. The food is always great and fresh. The garlic edamame is delicious. The creamy shrimp or chicken is yummy. The Siracha chicken is also great. The atmosphere is a great place to enjoy great food. I would definitely recommend this place. Great place for Asian food.
11/11/2013,3,"Bento Cafe has a great mix of Asian fusion that allows me to keep trying more and mroe delicious options however, the service doesn't really allow me to enjoy it as much as I like. Flip flopping between a quick service location and a table service experience - you never really know what to expect service wise from this location. Table service dining is usually a miss, multiple servers, ""auctioning"" of food, and entirely too slow delivery to the table. With all that being said, I haven't really tired anything I didn't like. I've even had my decent service nights, including one night where the server recommended a ""secret roll"" - the PB&J Roll - and WOW! What a sushi roll! This is my MUST order every time I dine here.Bento Cafe does offer a pretty decent happy hour for sushi with buy 2 rolls, get 1 free from 4-7 Monday through Friday. I would recommend checking it out, just make sure you're not under a time constraint."
6/6/2015,1,"Ordered  4 sushi rolls (fried). All four tasted like mud, the Panko was chewy and oily. No flavor whatsoever. The fried dumplings were old and freezer burnt.   ALPO would have tasted better. Big disappointment.  Won't be stopping by there again."
7/11/2015,3,"We've eaten here at Bento on many occassions.  With this restaurant it's truly hit and miss.  There have been times where the food and the service have been excellent and other times not so much.  We've been here when it's terribly busy and when it's not busy at all.We enjoy the sushi here and the price is decent.  They have a nice variety of choices not only for sushi but for Japanese and other Asian food.The service is ok but truly never excellent.  This visit was not so great.  The server was ok but when we told her my niece only wanted terriyaki chicken with the lo mein noodles with no vegetables she said ok and brought out the dish with cabbage mixed in the noodels.  We said something to her and her only resposne was, ""well the cabbage is already mixed in and they don't have those noodels without it.""  Well maybe when we told you she didn't want any vegetables you should have told us that at the time?!  Do you think?We didn't make a big deal out of it because we had already waited 55 minutes for our food and we were very hungry.  My poor 12 year old niece picked out that cabbage with each bite of food.I always get the Gucci roll which I find to be excellent.  This time is was ok, a little dry with the topping but still good.I definitely recommend this sushi restaurant but remember you never know exactly what the service will be like but the food is always consistenly good."
10/30/2017,3,"So this place is decent. I used to visit the downtown location a lot for lunch and this one is basically the same. The special Mexican roll and the create your own rolls are my favorite. I have had a few issues with this location. First, beware if you use a coupon, Yelp or otherwise. Many times they don't take the correct amount off and if you don't catch it you'll be paying for your ""free"" item. We've had to have this corrected many times. Second, they are not very accommodating to changes. Once I was able to do a create my own roll with mushrooms and after that I was always told no. The sushi chefs always refuse when it comes to changes. Lastly, (this has to with the create your own) I'm not sure many of the employees understand that when a customer asks if an ingredient can be used as something you chose from and they say yes, you shouldn't then be charged extra. They are really bad about telling you if something will cost extra, which again I've experienced many times simply bc I'm first told it's fine only to find out it's fine but costs more."
9/24/2016,5,Best place to come and hangout with friends the sushi is soooo good. The prices are very reasonable and ther Service is great.
4/11/2015,1,The men's bathroom ran out of hand soap and just saw a sushi chef come out of the bathroom and directly went back to his post on sushi line.
12/17/2018,1,Horrible hostesses and servers there. I stared at an empty dining room with my stomach growling for 25 minutes before I was seated. Only then to deal with atrocious attitudes from the servers that I dealt with. Food did not make up for it and my experience was overall very bad.
2/24/2017,5,"First timer, great customer service. Delicious tea my fav is the Thai tea, we went in for our  lunch break, food came out quickly and was able to get to work on time. Curry Katsu reminded me of my time in Japan."
2/24/2017,4,Great Lunch Spot. Favorite roll is special Mexican if you haven't tried it defiantly a must!
6/4/2014,3,"A really nice quick-Asian place with standard fare, pretty comparable to Pei-Wei.The prices are low, the food is sound, and the service is attentive. It really seems to me to be the clone of Pei-Wei which is essentially across the road.I've ordered the Udon Noodles, Red Curry, and Basil Chicken. The Udon Noodles are solid, but are tiring to eat considering they are ridiculously thick (as are all Udon Noodles). The Red Curry was pretty mediocre and I do not plan to ever order that dish again. The Basil Chicken on the other hand is solid, but has a certain taste to it that I cannot ascertain. It's an A-OK restaurant and that's pretty much all there is to it.I really enjoyed it the first time, but for me, the place got old fast. It may be because I attempted to eat here twice in one week, an event which I regret. I'll probably try it out a few more times in the future, but considering Pei Wei has a slight edge over Bento Cafe in my opinion, it will take a lot of effort to ditch that reliable restaurant. Still worth trying, and a place where you should consider enjoying a quick meal at."
12/15/2018,1,"Usually been very good BUT this time it was not. After 20 minutes of waiting and 2 groups that were in line after me were served, my wife went to ask and was told sushi was slow (her) but I didn't order sushi. Hers came out. Then people in the next booth were served-they we're not even in the building when I ordered but were served before me. When I finally got served the rice and shrimp tempura were both cold.not happy and will go to Bonsai Sushi on Doctor Phillips next time"
4/20/2013,3,"*I'd give it 3.5 stars.*Bento Café is a Pan-Asian restaurant chain with five locations, two of which are in Orlando.  I recently went to the Sand Lake location  with a group of friends for a birthday celebration.  I hadn't been here before because it didn't strike out to me as a place that I ""must try"".  Well, the birthday girl is raving about this place.  It was busy for a Friday night.  I liked the interior, the restaurant has a stylish modern look with red throughout.The menu is easy to order from.  You pick your entrée, the options are ""bento box"", ""noodle bowl"", or ""rice bowl"".  Then you select your protein and the style.  Easy enough and very customizable but so many choices.  Do I want to go more Chinese, Thai, or Japanese?  I just kept looking over the menu, up and down.  They also have a sushi menu that was priced reasonably.  I ordered the Fried Cheese Wontons and the Basil Chicken Noodle Bowl.  The Fried Cheese Wontons ($3.75) were really good.  Not too heavy tasting as far as the cream cheese goes, and the sauce on the side was tasty. I definitely didn't share these.Next, I had the Basil Chicken Noodle Bowl ($7.75).  It had chicken, noodles, basil, onions, carrots and a kung pao sauce.  I was craving some extra veggies, so I added broccoli.  If you order this, have them make it spicy.  You'll thank me for this.  Great tasting flavor, fresh vegetables, it's actually good.  The noodle bowl is a good portion size.  I tasted the Beef Bulgogi, it was decent too.  (Although for me it wasn't as flavorful as I've had in Korean restaurants.)Bento Café has boba (which is a flavored drink with tapioca pearls). Food-wise, I was surprised and enjoyed it.  Great flavors, good portions.  Service-wise, I do think they need some work.  The servers did not handle a large group well.  Some of people in the group showed up much much later and received their food before I did.  Luckily, I wasn't terribly hungry or else I would've gone into She-Hulk mode.  One of my friends waited awhile for her seaweed salad.  Seriously?  It's seaweed salad.  I'd come back but with a smaller party.All in all, it's in a great location, lots to choose from and you'll leave here full.  If you're just craving Asian food but can't decide, Bento Café is a good go-to option."
7/9/2014,3,"To start off we had the pork dumplings which were amazing! In a very mild spicy sauce that I've never had paired with dumplings . Next we had the Gucci roll and the udon noodle bowl with beef. Both were very good!! Totally would recommend. I don't like the process. You first have to pay for your meal and then they serve . Very different. Also, you don't get a personal connection with the ""server"". They're more like food runners. Very odd.Food= 4 stars Atmosphere and service = 3"
8/25/2018,4,"I love it! Awesome food, didn't wait for long, employees were amazing and the atmosphere was great."
11/11/2016,5,"Love the food here! Been going for years. The spicy cream sauce is delicious!!! However, it can get a little crazy at lunch and a little under staffed."
11/11/2014,4,Very casual place for some inexpensive sushi that is still very yummy!  My favorite rolls are the Special Mexican Roll and the Bali Hai Mango Roll. It usually takes them 10 minutes to make the rolls.Try it out if you like sushi!
6/10/2014,4,"Excellent food. Tasty, spicy if you want that. Good Japanese and street food. Service is a bit off sometimes. But overall good and reliable. Access is sometimes tough from Sandlake Rd if coming from West."
7/28/2016,2,Food is good but attitude here isn't  the office called in two different times for tool order and instead of adding to existing order they stated a new one.  When I went to pay I asked them to combine the checks and the manager told me she couldbt
3/26/2014,4,"I went here about a week ago and I had shrimp tempura bowl and an apple milk drink with lychee. The shrimp tempura bowl consisted of 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, white rice, and Broccoli. The price of the bowl was under $8 bucks and the drink was about $4.25 I think for the large size. The food it self was amazing well cooked very tasty!!! I grabbed an take out menu because I know I will eat here again. There are some cons tho, when eating there they had a slight nat problems I had to swat nats away from my food, and so did my friends. Plus parking can be a little troublesome. But overall the food is soooo gooooddd here!!!"
11/11/2009,4,"Bento's in Orlando is always raved about by Bento fans. They claim it is tons better than Bento's in Gainesville (which I have had in the past). I'm not sure about the other location in Orlando, but this one was about the same in taste. I ordered their sushi combo which was reasonably priced, but not really a steal either. The sushi was fresh and I really enjoyed the cucumbers they put into it (my friends enjoyed the seaweed salad that came in the bento box as well). The place is located in a really nice plaza and I wasn't disappointed with the service, so I would certainly stop by here again if I am in the area."
9/3/2011,4,"I lived on Bento throughout my college career in Gainesville and have been a fan since!Bento is a Pan-Asian restaurant so their menu offers a variety of different dishes. Some of my favorites off their menu are the Thai Coconut Curry, Bulgogi, Udon Stir-Fry, and the Curry Katsu.They also serve sushi and you will find a large selection of different sushi rolls on the menu, too. My favorite sushi roll has always been the Red Dragon which has shrimp tempura inside and fresh tuna on top. I would also recommend the Bali Hai roll. This sushi roll is a bit sweeter because it is topped with mango, coconut flakes, and eel sauce.The food is good, prices are cheap, and servers are attentive and friendly.Another plus, they have boba teas!!"
4/3/2010,3,"Ok so for this location I decided to visit multiple times before coming out with a verdict. I really like the red themed, asian fusion cafe type of vibe they produced with the decor and rocks inside the tables. The bento boxes and bobas teas are sooooo good. Bento boxes consist of your choice of savourful chicken or beef, moist rice, seasoned noodles, and a tiny itty bitty coffee cake. Balance is key and the bento boxes served it up...Boba lovers note:**On tuesday nights there is Happy hour for boba teas 2-4-1 ::high five:: they make happy hour for these yummyful drinks!** The milk teas here are almost as good as Lollycups..They use almost the same theme of corney animated cups with a huge boba sucking straw. With similiar tasting syrups and creamy all around goodness.::YAYYY::Now here comes some things that need work, because I believe this place could be the best it can with some simple clarification...If a menu was posted up on their website for the Orlando location it would be helpful upon entering. The rushed feeling of having to pick the first thing your eyes like because there is a line behind you of hungry bento lovers can be regretful. Do we tip before or after the meal?Is this a place that you have to clean up or the waiters do it for you?The service and ordering got me slightly lost...customers need a sense of direction..I noticed from previous reviews other people said the same thing about the Dr. Phillips location; the unconsistent service can be confusing. They have the potential to get more stars than deserving.(But you must try their boba.... the people at this place can curse me out, service me 30 mins late but I still need their addicting boba teas regardless lol. If u try one u might feel the same way!)"
2/5/2014,4,"Good environment, good food, and good service!Food could of been a little better but the experience overall was pretty good"
3/20/2012,3,"Overall 3.5 starsSERVICE: 3.5/5-sushi chefs were slow. We only ordered three rolls. Took over 20 mins. FOOD: 4/5-MT. FUJI: topped with krab. The first thing you taste is the krab , followed by the shrimp tempura and finally the eel sauce & rice. -SURF N KAWAII: :light and not heavy. Rice paper over lettuce with tuna, krab, shrimp tempura and avocado. Ingredients were imitation, shrimp tempura, tuna, avocado-ENVY: salmon, tuna, imitation crab, avocado topped with kiwi and masago topped with sweet chili sauce. All I could taste was rice and the flavor, not the avocado, krab or tuna :(-Chicken Fried Dumpling (free after one yelp check in)"
5/26/2012,1,"This place is extremely busy when we arrived.  There was a small waiting area and the there was no hostess to help speed things along.  After watching the waitress, possible half Asian, run around trying to clear tables, she comes back to ask who us next, but she is attempting to avoid the people who was actually next and begins to ask the last set of guest that entered.  I told the waitress that the lady ahead of me was actually next.  After directing the lady, who was before me, the waitress came back to the guests that came after me.  I rudely interrupted the waitress to tell her again that I am next.  This no-good waitress sat the guest that came after me at the bar then came back to sit me at my table.  I don't care what crappy school of etiquette you went to but you never sit anyone that came after before someone that came before, even if it is the President of the United States of America.   Businesses strive to have returning customers and this business lost me.The service is crap and the food is crappier.  The sushi rice is mushy and just way too wet.  It had no seasoning to it, just  mushy blobs of rice stuck on seaweed paper.  Everything here is based on a California roll.  They change the toppings and give it a different name.  They overuse Krab.  Yes, K-crab, the Pollock fish, shaped and colored to imitate crab.  Their rolls are not tight and every time I went to pick up a piece, stuff fell out of them.  The sashimi platter was a hit and miss.  They had some pieces that tasted fresh and there was pieces that would have been better if they used the correct knife to cut so there would be no steel aftertaste.  The pieces were cut into varying size pieces here. I personally feel that the pieces that were thinner and cut against the grain tasted better than the thick chunk pieces.I was extremely disappointed in the boba teas.  The waitress said that they are more a smoothie consistency because there is milk in it.  What a lie!!!!  It was not a smoothie consistency.  It was more like iced coffee consistency, loose and milky.Added later:My toddler was spitting out the boba from the boba tea so I waved down the closest wait staff member.   The young black male looked at me as if I was crazy to ask him for extra napkins!  I gave him a crazy look back, since I was making the most off the wall request.  I never in my life experience that reaction for asking for more napkins."
5/1/2013,4,"I like the variety of Bento Cafe, so I continue to come here. And it's the only place around that I can find Boba tea.On weekends they seat you and you have table service, otherwise it's order at the cash register and then take a seat. I have tried different things here and there and nothing amazing yet. The menu is so diverse, I have fun trying new things. Worth a shot.I have not tried their sushi there. I do that down the street at Seito, so I come to Bento Cafe for the variety of non-sushi related dishes."
2/27/2015,1,"Just sat for 15 full minutes in Bento Cafe (which has MAYBE 18 tables, tops) without a server even looking in our direction. There were servers standing around DELIBERATELY avoiding eye-contact with our table, obviously playing ""not-it"". When two tables seated after us were attended to before we were even greeted, we decided to leave. When we complained on our way out, the servers and seater just stared, stone-faced. They didn't even apologize. Avoid this place. Utterly unacceptable."
11/15/2015,4,Good service and great sushi. Not amazing sushi but for the price totally worth it. I will be going back soon.
4/12/2013,4,"I was in the mood for sushi and decided to try Bento Cafe since I was in the area. It took me a little while to become acquainted with the menu and decide what to order, and since it's counter service, it took me a bit of extra time. I decided on the Florida Roll (Tuna, salmon, and avocado) and the chicken tempura roll. Since Yelp gives you a free appetizer when you check in, I went for some garlic edamame. The sushi rolls were delicious and very tasty. I loved the Florida roll since it gave me the raw tuna I was craving, and the Chicken Tempura roll was awesome for those who may not be into the raw fish but want the sushi experience. It comes with sweet eel sauce drizzled over it and is absolute perfection. I'd have it again. The only complaint I have is the garlic edamame. I've had garlic edamame at other restaurants and it is usually combined with some other flavor, like lime. However, this edamame was garlic and ONLY garlic. Too much raw garlic. It was so overwhelming that I couldn't really eat much of it. I will say that they give you a ton for a low price (and mine was free, so that's even better), so that's a nice thing. Overall, I'd definitely come here again."
4/24/2016,5,"I stopped here a few weeks ago when I was in town for work, and then I happened to be back in Orlando for work again this week. It was good then, and good now. Memorable enough to warrant a second visit. The first time I was here was on a weekday around lunchtime and I placed my order at the counter and the food was brought to our table when it was ready. I'm here this time on a weekend and there is table service. I think they have table service on the weekends and evenings.  I had the yellow curry both times. First was a bento box, this time was a rice bowl. I preferred the variety of the bento box and would get that next time. The chicken was very tender. I also had the Special Mexican Roll this time and it was fantastic. The shrimp tempura was nice and crispy, which I appreciate in a shrimp tempura roll. They were unfortunately making another batch of boba when I ordered, so instead of waiting 15 minutes for it to get done, I ordered a different bubble tea with passion fruit jelly. I'm normally a lychee sort of girl, but they were out of that as well. Server was prompt, nice, and attentive, and helpful when I asked for suggestions. This will be a place I'd stop in again whenever I come through Orlando."
11/30/2017,5,First time here and it was a great experience. Great concept with the bento box!! Great atmosphere and my server Melissa was very sweet and attentive. I had the Pad Thai and my cousin had the Bento Box. Both were extremely filling and well made and we even tried a sushi roll which was very well made. Will definitely be back
4/22/2014,5,"I want to live and die here.Favorite sushi - the special mexican roll, and the Mt. Fuju roll.If you are getting a Bento Box, the spicy cream chicken is amazing.The staff is generally very friendly.  I'll never forget Halloween when a Power Ranger was there."
4/17/2013,4,"I absolutely love Bento Cafe, except that almost every time I am there they are out of something that I want, usually the Mocha Magic Milk Tea (sometimes the pearls, sometimes mocha, and one time cups!)Now, I am not a sushi fan, so I have never had the sushi, but anyone I go with rants and raves about it. I normally get the spicy edamame which is amazing, and I have tried the regular and garlic and loved them too. I have tried the Cajun Beef, Teriyaki Beef, Spicy Cream Chicken (my favorite), and the Sweet and Sour Chicken and enjoyed them every time. I have also had the General Tso's, which is normally my go to favorite Asian dish, and loved it all but one time where it literally looked like canned dog food so I have not ordered it since. My only other complaint would be about the size of the restaurant. Every time I have been there, they are relatively busy, and the space itself is pretty small even if you include the outside seating."
9/9/2016,3,"Love the food not the service. I have eaten inside and it was good. I have ordered in for 'to go' and its 99 % of times, that they come up with food and ask you if its 'to go' and again go back to pack it. Thats just such a waste of time.Now today, called in thinking the food will be ready when I get there, it sat there until she finished taking everyones orders. She said I had to wait in line!!  Real waste of time when you get your order after 25 mins after ordering on the phone. They were quiet busy but only one register was open and no one else could take orders. Don't undertsand why they do not hire more people to take orders."
11/25/2011,5,"Passing through Orlando I was craving two things: sushi and bubble tea; this place had both. When I arrived, they did honor the Yelp check in offer of one free appetizer with $10 purchase. I chose edamame and wasn't disappointed in the slightest.They have a huge menu of sushi and then also have noodle soups and other things, but I was here for the sushi. They had tons of specially rolls and even a create your own option, but I got the TNT roll and a couple pieces of nigri. The fresh was super fresh and the TNT roll was super spicy. I got an almond bubble tea which was delicious. They have lots of flavors of these and they go great with sushi. I'd come back here for sure."
2/18/2012,3,"The Sand Lake Bento Cafe is part of a 5-restaurant chain based in Gainesville. It's a casual Pan Asian-sushi spot located next to Bar Louie in the Rialto Center on Restaurant Row.One can feel the college-town origins here, as prices are pretty low, rock music rather than Eastern music is played, and the clientele tends to be on the young side.  This location is apparently very popular, if today was any indication.  I don't know if I've ever been to a sushi restaurant that was doing so much Saturday lunch business, both dine-in and takeaway.I guess the draw is the nicely-priced bento boxes.  However, I chose the sushi menu, which features a pretty nice assortment of nigiri, sashimi and specialty rolls.  The nigiri/sashimi offerings eclipsed the rolls, which was okay by me.  I enjoyed a nice grouping of salmon and eel sashimi, and a masago nigiri, along with a Veggie Delight Roll and a Mexican Roll.This isn't the place to go to impress a date, but it sates your sushi cravings at an affordable price."
1/24/2016,5,"Amazing food, seated at our table promptly, service was great, and the food was amazing. Definitely should be in your list for places to go to grab sushi."
10/19/2011,4,"Great sushi place close to Universal Studios. Got a free appetizers with the yelp app on my phone..sweet! I tried the vegetarian roll and the mexican roll, both quite good. My friends were also happy with their selection. Staff was on point. Nice decor. Affordable prices."
11/8/2010,4,"My Ratings: Quantity: 4 - plentyQuality: 4 - yummyPrice: 4 - goodLocation: 4 - Cool place!Parking: 4 - Parking lot Service: 4 - coolSpeed: 3 - GoodOverall: I would come back for their sushi!My Opinion/Story: Got a groupon to try this place while we're in the area.

5/5/2015,4,This restaurant was pretty good. The sushi was decent and I do like the prices. I do enjoy the job idea that they have with the bento box. I went there with my co workers for lunch once a while and the bento box is always what I get for a decent price. They are pretty quick to I usually get my food in and by 15 mins I am usually out the door and headed back to work to eat there. The service there is nice the workers are friendly there are some that are not to customer service friendly but I can deal with it other then that will be still going there once in a while when I am in the mood for sushi.
3/21/2016,5,"One of my favorite places to go for work lunch. Buy one get one boba tea on Tuesdays, amazing curry katsu noodle bowl, and the sushi combo box is great sushi for its price."
1/25/2013,4,"The first time I ever had sushi was at a Bento in Gainesville in 2005-2006.  This has proven to be a reliable chain when it comes to sushi and noodle bowls.  This location has a clean modern looking interior (most of them do) with a tv behind the bar and tvs on the opposite wall in the main dining area.  The fish is generally fresh and they have a great buy 2 get 1 free happy our special on select sushi rolls running throughout the week.  Whether it be sushi rolls, noodle bowls or sashimi Bento has a bit of everything for the beginner to intermediate fan of Japanese food.  For those chickens that are afraid to try sushi because the fish may not be cooked, there are alternative sushi rolls that contain cooked chicken or beef.  Fake it til you make it!"
1/1/2016,4,"Bento Cafe, first time there was in Jacksonville FL and it was packed and the food was excellent. Then we found one in Orlando and it was amazing as well. The food is very good and service is good as well. Highly recommend."
12/12/2010,1,"I'm in the same boat as Mike M. Why on earth do people like this place? I was recommended to go by a friend as a good place for sushi when looking for a good new place to try.  On my first trip, I took my Japanese friend and we both were not really sure where to sit but finally got some direction. Our waiter was a nice girl but a little confused but that could be from my friend's accent I guess. Anyway we didn't end up getting sushi but decided to try a bento box instead. Big mistake. Completely lacking in flavor, my friend's stir fry looked mushy and wasn't very tasty. The little cake that comes with it yeah no thanks. Nobody likes dry weird cake. My second visit came because my boss had one of those restaurant.com coupons and he wanted to take me and my boyfriend out for dinner. I agreed to go so we could try their boba and their sushi and give it a second shot. We should have just eaten at Bar Louie next door.We got appetizers because they had a buy 1 get one free. Spring rolls were mushy on the inside once you bit into them, mushy vegetables are no good. Dumplings tasted funny I didn't even finish a whole one. Whatever weird sauce they slather it in, that would be to hide the taste of awful.So next Is boba, my boyfriend's was lukewarm and mine though cold just wasn't very good. I didn't even get half way through. If you looked at my cup you'd think I hadn't drank any. I'll stick to lollicup and traveling to my favorite cities and hitting up their japan/china towns thanks. I like variety when I order anyway and their selection is very lacking.My boss doesn't approve of any place where all the drinks come in thin plastic cups. I ordered Udon ha, the noodles tasted like the precooked kind from the grocery store and the soup was flavorless as was the chicken. It's strange because I thought I'd ordered spicy udon. For my first udon outside of San Francisco definitely a mistake to get it here. I barely ate it, the waitress asked me if I wanted a to go container and I just laughed. My bf got sushi to which he said you could get better sushi at whole foods. I've never seen this guy not finish sushi EVER. He said it was one step up from being bad sushi and that it wasn't good. Never again, if a group of friends are going here they can count me way out."
5/3/2012,4,"They have a great selection of Japanese beers, I chose the Kirin Light, and in Japanese style they pour it into your glass for you and you still have half a bottle left. For an appetizer I ordered the sushi sampler which come with a tuna role and 5 pieces of sushi (you choose which 5) and for my main course I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken Bento Box"
2/1/2013,3,"This place is okay, but I don't get the concept. Why do I have to order at the counter when the rest of the place is run like a regular table service restaurant? If you want an assortment of sushi, it's awkward to have to decide on everything while in line. Quality of the bento boxes is fine, but I'd rather just go to a sushi bar."
5/12/2018,5,i love thiss soo muchh. best food ever. cane all the way from miami. thwjdjcjxjfjjfd f. f. d dd d e f. g r e r  g rr tf ff f f ffr wew ef. g hh
5/5/2018,4,"The food is great, and there are sufficent options for vegetarian people as well. The only downside is that the boba is mediocre."
8/20/2015,1,"I had my food delivered through doorstep. I paid almost $11 for a spicy seafood udon noodle bowl. It wasn't udon. It was egg noodle. Seafood? Are you joking with me? It was literally 6 pieces of small shrimp, two imitation crab sticks, 4 pea size scallop with bokchoy. I don't know why I expected so much from such a low quality Asian fusion restaurant."
11/17/2011,3,"I've been coming here for quite some time now and I can say with confidence it's not somewhere that always sticks out in my mind, it's always just a plan B. The edamame is always over-cooked, the sushi never tastes fresh, and the stir-fry never seems to have enough flavor for me. The one good thing is they have a great selection of Sake, which I LOVE. Also, their service is always on point which always makes an experience better for me. Other than that, nothing else really comes to mind about Bento for me."
10/18/2015,1,"Service was extremely slow. Our waitress had the worst attitude. The food wasn't special, won't come back."
8/4/2015,4,"Love the assortment in the bento box. I had the sweet & sour chicken, it was good (especially liked the richness of the sauce). My husband had the black bean chicken, and he said it was excellent. We also had the edamame (free with Yelp coupon). We plan on returning to try other items!"
4/13/2018,5,As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is great. Shawn was our server and he is the best. His personality is amazing and he's an excellent people person this place is highly recommended and if you go ask for shawn.
6/28/2011,4,"I LOVE this place! And I definitely miss it ! Used to eat here all the time when I lived in Orlando-- breakfast, lunch, and dinner... okay exaggerating a bit. But I did frequent this place at least a couple times a week. Love the noodle bowls. Great flavor! Lots to choose from. It's Pan Asian, so you'll get Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese. The sushi rolls are really good too and the chef usually have a special roll of the day (his creation). And I've seen by popular demand, some of them ended up on the menu as a permanent item. They have flavored sake which is really cool. (I'm not a sake connoisseur so it is sweet flavored and palatable, its considered good to me!) The y have boba (bubble) tea as well- which I'm not a huge fan of-- I've had better ones.  All in all, great place. Love it. Miss it."
6/3/2013,4,"Really great chicken teriyaki.  Nice, clean, upscale atmosphere at a pretty cheap price.  The Bento Box comes with a bunch of sides for under $10.  Yelp reviewers have put Sushiology above this place... go here instead!  It's just all the International Drive tourists leaving reviews because they don't want to wander a half mile off I Drive."
9/27/2010,3,"Again, a place that I was curious about and finally visited, thanks to an outstanding offer made by Groupon!In contrast to my other super deals (bikram yoga, dandelion) however, I have to say...well, I'll take a quotation from one of my favorite movies, 10 things I hate about you - ""I know you can be overwhelmed or underwhelmed, but could you ever just be whelmed?"" Yes, and Bento cafe is living proof.To be fair, yes, I did enjoy my boba tea and the meal I chose definitely was eaten, but other than that...see, I had checked out Yelp! and was prepared for their slightly confusing ordering system and blasé interior decorating, but was surprised by the ambivalent nature of the servers and noticeable annoyance at the sight of my printed coupon.  We waited for what seemed like hours for the cashier to find our info in a printed stack of what I presumed to be other Groupon purchasers and an eye roll was hardly suppressed at my husband who was so equate befuddled by the menu.Lunch itself proved enjoyable, but neither of us felt compelled to return."
4/3/2018,5,"Their sushi is definitely a hidden gem in Orlando. Great atmosphere, great bowls, great boba tea. Something that really stood out was there service. Someone needs to promote Sean because this guy does everything right. This guy goes above and beyond and this sushi joint is lucky to have someone like him. Definitely will be coming back!"
6/29/2012,4,"OK so, yeah it's counter service, ""sort of"" but really who cares?  My dad doesn't like this place at all because you order at the register like Pei Wei, but I say phooey to him because you can sit at the Sushi bar and get served just like anywhere else.  Not to mention they have a really nice array of sushi and kitchen dishes, so there's something for everyone.  The place is well decorated and always has great tunes playing in the background, and to top it all off, they finally have free wi-fi so I can go here at lunch and eat a nice meal and continue with my workday.  Thanks Bento! So lets talk about the food, I had a Chirashi again... and it was a nice assortment of sashimi on the rice like usual and even had seaweed salad (yum) on the plate to add the nice crunch.  When I checked in on Yelp, they had a great offer for a free appetizer... Yes please, I think I will enjoy the spicy steamed dumplings!!! Thanks again Bento!  My friend met me there and she had a beefy soup noodle bowl.... I don't know what the heck was in it, but it sure was chock full of meat, noodles, broth and all kinds of colorful veggies... I didn't taste it... we're not that close... lol... But if I had been there with the girlfriend, I would have been pushing her a side to get whiff and slurp of the soup....So go check out Bento Cafe and make friends with the sushi chefs, they haven't really changed there in years... always the same guys and they always remember my name and will make you something a little special.  If you are a Seito Sushi or Amuras fan, go there and spend crazy amounts of money and help keep the lines shorter at Bento for me... because this place has good sushi and other fixin's at a great price if you don't mind ordering at a counter.Note, this place gets busy and sometimes the service suffers a little because of that, but remember, you order at the counter, you can get your own drinks etc., so there's really no reason to complain, just get up and get what you need.Arigato!"
9/14/2017,1,"I'm sad to say that I rate this place based on my experience today, I have been a loyal customer since I have moved to Orlando. Where do I start to describe the way Bento Cafe and its management lack experience in problem solving. We waited about 20min to get our drinks after we placed our order. Then when we received our sushi it wasn't made the way we specified with soy paper instead of seaweed. Then after waited another 20min for our food to have seaweed and fish broth in my chicken udon soup. I have gone to several places in the US alone that make several options with the broth: chicken, beef, shrimp/fish. It wasn't specified on the menu that they only offer fish broth. Not only that they brought a plate that we didn't order, instead of the chicken fried rice we did. Still hadn't received my Milk tea, until all the food came. Okay so they fixed it with getting me a bento box pronto status and fixing the chicken fried rice mix up. Thanks. So we finally eat. The chicken is so burnt I can't even eat some of it. The waiter offered to give us a discount $5 off for various things going wrong. We get the check. I get the wrong ticket and change back. I am finally upset with their lack of customer service. I had to remind my waiter how much money I gave him. I had to literally count the money in front of him and tell him how much change to give me back.  What a headache of experience for my family dinner."
6/26/2016,5,"Having only recently started going to Bento Café, I am completely hooked. The Gucci Roll is a must for each visit that I make to Bento. A new favorite of mine is the Mt. Fuji roll. The krab was cooked perfectly and still warm enough after a 15 min drive home. The best part about Bento though, is that they have plenty of locations in the Orlando area so that it's always pretty convenient to visit one. Even if one isn't nearby, I will still go out of my way for a Bento fix."
12/31/2010,2,"Came to Bento's Cafe last year, however I still remember the experience of Bento's quite vividly. The atmosphere of this place is modern and electric. Very lively and I guess what you can say ''Americanized.'' I remember I ordered a Bento Box. When it arrived, I stared blankly at the mushed rice and wilted veggies... my eyes even popped a little at the square chocolate cake in the side slot. Okay, now I knew I was in for a surprise~! The main shrimp was OKAY. You could easily grill shrimp at home with better result and taste. The veggies/salad was SO SALTY. I'm not sure if the sauce was salty or if the chef mistakenly added one too many teaspoons of salt.. but talk about packing on the sodium! The rice..was okay as well. Wasn't fluffy. Bleh. (NON-FLUFFY RICE = big nono ) My friend ordered tempura shrimp which was pretty decent tasting. It wasn't dripping in oil, but there was no wow factor to it. Another companion had an order of sushi, I can't recall what type of roll it was.. but I remember the it being tasteless. No fresh ingredients nor colorful bounce in the mouth. NOW.. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOBA TEA HERE: one word : GROSS! Save your money and go to Lolicup or elsewhere if you're looking for Boba tea! The Boba tea they serve here shouldn't even be consider Boba tea, more like.. .Grainy colored milk. T__T. I can't believe spent so much money here. The honey dew Boba was disgusting. Too overly sweet and the texture WAS NOT pleasant. All in all, the vibe of Bento's Cafe is lovely. The staff is friendly and it has a cool fun feel to it. (Best for LUNCH meet up with friends) Do not go here if you're looking for yummy Asian cuisine, stray far..and go a little further...."
8/7/2015,3,"Good food, good service. Been here many times and the food isn't always consistent. However it's decent enough that if I want a boba and katsu I'll come here. Good sushi selection. But the boba is the main reason I come. Bento box is ok, however I feel like it's better to get a main dish."
2/6/2013,4,"Perfect little hotspot where you can dine quickly or stay and enjoy the atmosphere. I wish they would open these down south, I think they would do really well! Anyways, I've been to the Bentos in Gainesville and Orlando many times. On rate occasions does it ever disappoint. There are SO many different entree options to choose from! Which is a blessing AND a curse, haha. My favorite thing is that you can pretty much choose any entree and then choose to have it as a rice bowl, noodle bowl or as a bento box that comes with your typical bento sides. With a drink here ( of course, get Boba! ) you're looking to spend approx $10 pp. but it's not bad because it's a good amount of food and it'll last you awhile. My favorite are the bulgogi & mongolian rice bowls. I tried the Thai Fried Rice here and it was bland, IMO. But, on the plus, it was spicy! They added a bunch of chili peppers which I'm totally not even used to. Coming from Miami, when you are spicy it's barely a hint. Here, it's added in without a warning and I really enjoyed that. More ""authentic"" and brings the heat -- literally."
12/13/2017,4,"I go here all the time and most of the time the food is very good. The hot dishes come very fresh and quick. The sushi has usually been good quality fish. The only thing that needs work is the staff is very good at avoiding working. They are actually kinda lazy in serving and cleaning! But I still rate the food good, especially since in the area there is not many other sushi places."
10/8/2017,4,I really loved the food and I been here numerous times. The variety is wonderful but make sure you don't go to late like a hour before it closes or else you won't get utensils and will either have to eat with chopsticks or plastic forks/knives. I will go back but NEVER a hour before it closes again.
9/16/2014,4,"After getting back from the theme park and a 10-hour fun-flled day, the stomach began to make some rumblings, and the sweet tooth came out to play, its 11 pm and late night  dine-in food options on the Disney World Property are very very scarce, if not non-existent. So this is where #yelpHelps, simple quick search for Boba Tea/orlando/late nite, and boom Bento Box shows up, remind you main thing we are going now for is Boba Tea, but as we continue to read the reviews, the boba quality seems to not be up too par and quality is rated poor by many, so we continite to search for places open for boba tea past 11pm on a saturday night, after a few more minutes of searching and traveling along the I-4, we realize there are no other options, so its either Bento Box or Nothing, As we enter the plaza, we come across alot of cars, and a lil nite spot, ""Bar Louie"", beside Bento Box. Reading the reviews, we already have suspect expectations of the boba tea, but still want, so we figure to give it a shot. The Waitress comes and we order boba tea first, but  it turns out they have run out of ""pearls"" (boba) for the day, it's 11.40pm so  i guess it was somewhat understandable, but how is it ""boba tea"", with no boba? Disappointed at this point, I chose not to order a boba tea, but the rest of the party does, she orders a Pineapple-Mango,ironicly it turned out to being one of my most flavorful teas she has ever had, now only if it had boba, tisk tisk. Ordered a miso soup, a jb roll, and candy roll. The Candy Roll was very good. The menu may look simple at first, but they have a very wide variety of pan-asian and sushi dishes, I will be sure to re-visit Bento Box on a future trip to Orlando as that Im very curious to try some of the other sushi rolls and dishes that I saw on the menu, and hopefully next time they will have bobas for the tea.Nice simple decor, not over the top, but chic spot, Food is priced well, not overly expensive. A True example of how helpful Yelp is for late-nite out of town sitituations, good thing we followed our instincts and still gave the place a shot, even after reading the negative reviews, we would have never discovered this future spot if we didnt try it out for ourselves. So yea Reviews are good and all, provides a heads-up, but if you have that yearning/instinct that wants to find out  for yourself, always do so!!#yelpHelps"
2/27/2018,3,I went in for lunch and I mentioned to the Spanish guy cashier how the other day I had come in for lunch as well like I usually do. So I told him I had ordered edamame to go on my last visit but that it had been a little burnt and they tasted a little old the garlic didn't look nor tasted fresh it kind of looked like it had been sitting there and they just gave it to me to get rid of it. He kind of cut me off and said I should have called that same day and I could have been compensated or they could have fixed the problem. It wasn't a big deal at the time I was only trying to let him know that I didn't want it that way again but he didn't reassure me or apologize as he saw I was a little disappointed. He ended up giving me the runaround so I ended up taking my lunch and not reordering my edamame. Will I go back? Probably not as that cashier kind of ruined my experience and overall I would give this place only a 3 for customer service apparently the customer is not always right here.
2/7/2012,4,"We had a very enjoyable meal at Bento. The restaurant itself is very clean, and our waiter was very helpful, as this was our first visit. I fully enjoyed the Red Curry Shrimp noodle bowl, just the right amount of heat, the noodles were firm and tasty, the vegetables fresh and crisp, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My wife had the Thai Coconut Chicken noodle bowl; again, everything cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. We would very definitely return for another meal, especially as it is one of the most reasonably-priced restaurants in the area."
9/3/2014,3,"Bento is a great fast casual restaurant (at lunch) that turns into casual dining for dinner. Not being from Orlando, we've brought a couple groups from out of town here and they are always impressed by the quality of the food (sushi and main menu) as well as the value. Sushi can be (VERY) slow but main menu/hot dishes are pretty quick. Service is the one reason they are a 3 not a 4 star. While servers are nice enough, they aren't invested in the experience. Weekdays you can get 1/2 off sushi and walk away full without a huge hit to the wallet. I'm a sucker for their bento boxes that come with a little bit of everything but particularly like the black bean bowl. The dinner menu is setup like pei wei, you pick the flavor, the protein and the plus is you can either have it delivered bento, rice bowl or noodle bowl style. Happy Eating!"
1/1/2015,1,"Everyone told me to try this restuarant. So I did, I ordered udon noodle bowl with chicken. The bowl was very watery and had no flavor. When I told the server I didn't like it she didn't know what to do. She got her manager and the manager said I would have to pay for half of my meal that I didn't like and the full price for a new meal. I only had two bites from the noodle bowl. This was the worst guest service I have ever experienced. And the food was tasteless"
11/8/2015,5,"OMG! After a while day we of shopping we were craving noodles and sushi. We came across Bento Cafe. Wanda our server was super friendly and so helpful when we were ordering. The sake, sushi, boba and especially Bento box was super delicious and exactly what we needed. We our fans! :-)"
11/27/2016,1,"I eat sushi often and this is the first Resteraunt I've been to that no one in the Resteraunt could answer my question regarding one of the cuts for my sashimi platter. They had no idea what or where it came from.  The server kept telling me it's a fish.  Sorry, many Restaurants serve garbage  fish like Escobar ( they call it white tuna).  I decided to leave at this point."
3/27/2016,2,"I love the food, but that is all I like about Bento. The service is horrible. I feel like they don't know what they are doing, they always mess my order up, like I said before I really enjoy the food, but they really need to learn great customer service."
10/19/2015,5,"I've been to a Bento Café in Jacksonville, and I love it. This location is just as good. Amazing sushi, and delicious milk teas. I really enjoyed the miso soup, too! I can't wait to go back!"
5/16/2015,5,"My friends and I come here on a regular and it has not disappointed yet! It's great for lunch, you can even get free appetizer when you check in with yelp. The sushi is made fresh, boba tea is yummy! So many great things to mention but I'll just have to let y'all try it for yourselves"
12/27/2017,2,"Don't waste your time. Waited in line for 15 minutes to get an overpriced 11.00 ""signature"" roll that was SUCH SMALL pieces and served on a white appetizer plate. Oh and, my boyfriend had to pay $9.00 for a TWO ingredient sushi roll because of allergies. Salmon and cream cheese. Total ripoff. Go to a real sushi restaurant where you will get your money's worth."
7/26/2015,5,"We are from Miami and every time we drive up to Orlando, we have to eat at Bento Cafe. The food is good and the prices are good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
8/16/2010,4,I like to order the teriyaki beef bento box.  The crunch roll is really good and I normally get that with the house salad which is fresh or the seaweed salad. This place is good and inexpensive.  Try the bubble tea and smoothie with the bubbles.  This is a nice chill place where my friends and I catch up.
2/20/2014,3,"We've ordered from here a few times and the experience has always been mixed. The good: prices are low, and some of the items can be quite tastyThe Bad: Can get very crowded, definitely better to order in and the quality of food is inconsistentOverall, I'd say this is a decent place to try out some well-priced sushi, especially if you're close by"
1/8/2013,3,"I've been going to the Bento's in Gainesville occassionaly for the past 8 years or so? And I've been to this Bento (and the one in downtown Orlando) a few times, and didn't have a complaint until now. My family was with 2 other families, and we totaled 20 people. Large group, hard to miss, obviously need to be seated. However, I think we were standing there for several minutes before anyone paid us any attention. One of our girls had to stop someone and ask for tables to be setup for us. I can't complain about the rest of our service, though. Handling 20 people is quite a struggle, I'm sure, so I try to be as patient and understanding as possible.The thing I like about Bento is their big menu of boba flavors. What I don't like about that menu is that they have names like Lover's or something or other that give no clue what flavors actually comprise the drink. But all the servers do know their stuff and can explain it to you. Sadly, the boba milk tea I ordered came out room temperature. They didn't put ice in it. Or if they did, it was so little that it melted already but didn't keep my drink cold. Yuck.I usually order off the sushi menu, but I was feeling a little different that day and ordered curry. Lesson learned. I will stick to the sushi. It's not that the curry was terrible. It just wasn't good enough for me to finish it. They definitely do sushi better."
9/11/2010,3,"Bento Cafe for dinner. Yummy! I'm usually not one for fusion cuisine, however I like this unfussy casual restaurant. Weeknights and all day on weekends it's table service. Not what I was expecting, but appreciated as it can be hard to deal with a tray with a small one in tow... For an appetizer we ordered the fried pork dumplings, 5 per order. The pork filling was flavorful, but I'm not a huge fan of the fried part. The dipping sauce was a delicious blend of soy sauce and chili sauce. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll. The fish was fresh and the spicy sauce was spicy, but the roll was slightly warm and the rice slightly too sweet. I would skip the sushi on a next visit. I ordered the Korean Spicy with chicken over noodles; slices of white chicken with onion and scallion in a mild Korean pepper paste. I didn't quite read the ""mild"" part, so was disappointed in the heat index. However, it was flavorful and not greasy/oily and the mini udon noodles were cooked just right. Husband ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Rice bowl. Tasted like... Teriyaki Chicken over rice. Also came with a side of stir fried green beans. Green beans were good, but a little greasy. Small one ordered the Chicken Fried Rice with no veggies. (I finally figured out that it's easier to order without, than to try and pick them all out!) Order initially came out with veggies, but they quickly made a replacement. Tasteless, but I can't fault the kitchen for that! Ordering can be overwhelming as you have a choice between a bento box, rice bowl or noodle bowl, then the entree ""topping"". Plus, there are several choices of protein for each entree. There is a PDF menu available on-line at the website, so if you have difficulty making snap decisions when it comes to food, you might want to take a look prior to heading out for your meal. Note: the kids menu is not available on-line, but they had a nice variety for the kids. Overall I enjoyed our experience and we'll be back in the future!"
4/16/2015,5,Keep coming back for the sushi! It's a go to for my friends and I on a day off or after work looking for good food. My buddy gets the bowls everytime and loves them. Miso soup is nice to start with. Don't miss out on that Dragon roll.
3/8/2011,4,Let me preface this with the following:  I love all different kinds of sushi and sashimi.  I can appreciate beautifully prepared cuts and mucked up Americanized disasters.I have had a great time every time I have visited this place.It's funky.  The booth has pillows and a funky lounge feel.I love that they have a dozen spicy rolls and many come with roe... nom nom!  I have not had any issues with chewy nori nor overly fishiness.The service is friendly; I have only had positive experiences!
3/20/2012,4,"I really like the food here but to be honest - I only go for the teas really. :) They are just too good (and too cute). We don't go here often because it's completely out of the way for us, but I like this location more than the one downtown. Wish they would open one in the Altamonte Springs area! I am sure it would do really well. Then I could get my teas more often. :("
8/11/2014,5,"Bento is awesome. They are nicely located,  their menu offers a great variety of Asian dishes and the price is just right. The staff is very friendly, but the restaurant is somewhat small... So reservation is recommended since they are usually busy."
5/9/2017,3,"Mediocre at best, too may other choices on Sand Lake Rd . Waited a long time for a very disorganized hostess to seat us. Ordered the box with beef, was ok. Others in party ordered sushi and other dishes. All, just Ok, but it is a inexpensive meal and that was what we received.  Waiter was good and made up for some of hostesses shortcomings."
5/3/2015,4,"The food is good not spectacular,  the service is good too, just get in mind you get what you pay, but for the price is worth the visit"
2/8/2015,4,"They have a great selection of Asian foods from Sushi to Chinese to noodle and rice bowls. Clean, contemporary decor and so far I've loved everything I've tried here. Lychee green tea is a must!"
1/22/2012,5,"Excellent Sushi!  We always sit at the Sushi bar and the chefs take care of us right away.  They will make speciality rolls if we request and service is always quick.  Food is priced reasonable and its a cool, laid back atmosphere.  Highly recommended.  Amura used to be my favorite but its just to stuff and overpriced, Bento Cafe's Sushi is as good if not better."
9/5/2017,4,"Great place to go have a nice dinner at, the food is pretty good and the service is great. Our server Manny was very well-mannered and took care of us very well. Will be coming back soon!"
11/30/2014,1,I've been to multiple bento locations all over Florida but the customer service at this one is definitely the worst. I called an order in for pick-up and upon arrival the girl at the register just ignored me as she closed other checks. I then said something to get her attention and said she would be right with me as she still continued to close out checks and wouldn't call anyone else to help me in picking up my order. They also gave me white rice instead of brown rice(but charged me the extra $1.50) and when I got home and opened my food I saw that they hadn't included the sauce that comes with the dish. Worst bento experience.
8/8/2017,5,ITS AMAZING! The katsu chicken noodle bowl is so good and great for people who don't know what to order. So grateful my friend introduced me to this place!
5/6/2015,5,"Fast, delicious and affordable food!  Great service and always nice atmosphere- conveniently located :)"
4/26/2017,1,Who charges for an extra side of Siracha? This is a chain... Not even mom and pop restaurants do that
4/18/2017,2,"Their boba teas lately have been TERRIBLE. I don't know who is making them now but they're trying to rip us off by using way smaller cups, half the time they're ""ran out"" of tea??? And when they do make it it's horrible flavor. Wtf?"
5/2/2011,3,"I want to give 3 and 1/2 stars.As the other reviewers commented, Bento Cafe has a nice modern atmosphere. The waiters and waitresses I encountered were all nice and helpful. I ordered rolls (spider and eel) while the rest of my family ordered bento boxes. Everyone enjoyed their bento boxes, but I've had much better rolls elsewhere. The rolls were very small. Particularly the spider roll; I had to use a magnifying glass to find the crabmeat in those rolls -- lol."
3/29/2015,5,Fantastic Sushi!! Can't believe this place isn't higher rated!! Tons of options!! Very fresh and tasty!! Would come back in a heartbeat! Prices are great!!
6/18/2017,1,Terrible service! I called my order in 15 minutes before I picked it up and came in and paid. I then waited another 15 minutes before realizing people who walked in and ordered after me we already eating. I asked how much longer and they said they didn't know because they were behind and there excuse was they were behind because it was Father's Day. But hello people who came in after me were eating so that didn't add up.  I think they forgot to put my order in when I called and instead of telling me that just made me wait 45 minutes for fast food sushi.
6/8/2017,1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. My favorite dish has been ruined. Bento please bring back the old baby udon noodles. These new ones are horrible
10/4/2016,5,"i love this place! service is always always great, seriously now that i think about it, the amount of times we've been here and the amount of trips in which we experienced bad service totals to 0 which is pretty much statistically impossible.  that being said, go! my favorites are the pad thai noodle bowl, or the red curry chicken katsu bento box. Remember to order yourself a boba tea on your way out!"
4/30/2014,3,So we stop and had lunch here. I have to nothing special about this restaurant. The service was ok and nothing we order stood  out. We all agreed that kyotos is much better.
9/11/2014,4,"My wife gets a hanker for sushi monthly and we have tried multiple locations around town, most have limited non sushi menu's until Bento Box.  I would pass most times due to the fact I am not a big fan of sushi but I am a fan of Bento. Good stuff."
11/11/2014,4,"I love their Mochi dessert especially the red bean and mango flavors.  I have tried the veggie roll, the veggie delite roll and the cucumber avocado roll and I love them all. They are put together very well and are tasty. You can also get plain edamame, garlic or spicy. All 3 are yummy but my favorite is the garlic. It's usually busy when I go there but the service is always friendly and timely.  I love that it is a casual place and the prices are great too!"
2/20/2014,1,This place sucks. Sushi is average. Waiter wouldn't let me take my sushi roll leftovers because it was happy hour. Ridiculous. Never coming again.
8/1/2014,4,Really enjoyed the sushi and the shu mai appetizer is very good. My favorite sushi is the Gucci roll its texture of crunchy and hot is what makes is awesome. Only thing I found odd is they charge extra for sauces
7/26/2014,4,"Surprisingly good. I have high standards when it comes to sushi, but this place was a nice surprise. I was craving a sashimi bowl. It hit the spot and will have me coming back for seconds!"
7/22/2016,2,"The food was amazing, but the only two things that ruined it was the service and the boba. The boba was terrible. I ordered a taro and taro is suppose to have a purple color, but I got it and it was brown. It was putrid. The server, I have no idea where to start. She looked like she hated her job. I understand if you probably judged us before you got to the table, like oh look I got young adults and I'm not going to receive tip. I work in a restaurant and I give 100% service, despite skin color or attitude, because it's my money and I need to earn it. It was so frustrating to have that server, I'm assuming her name was Shannon or dean one of those. Yes, my service was that bad that she didn't introduced herself or she made it not recognizable. I can recognize her face if I saw her, but I do not ever want to receive her service again. I've had several services like that at bento and I feel like they need to retrain most of the staff."
7/19/2014,5,Love Bento! I come here all the time for lunch. Every sushi roll I've ordered is delicious. My favorite items on the menu are the Special Mexican Roll and Spicy Tuna Don.
5/16/2014,4,"We ordered two rolls made with brown rice. The seafood was fresh, the food tasted great but the rolls would fall apart before I could get them off the plate. The service was nice but we did wait 20-30mins just for our two rolls. Then when we ordered the green tea ice cream dessert, that took 15mins. It's a nice place and the fact you order your food up at the register & then sit makes you feel like it's a ""fast"" sushi place. It wasn't fast at all but the food was great."
12/11/2013,5,"LOVE this place!!! When  a friend brought me in the first time, the service was great,  but the Spicy Seafood soup bowl was soo authentic & awesome, I decided to come back again!!Now I can honestly say I eat here at least once a week for dinner, if not more!!The staff is friendly and accommodating & is always happy to alter dishes & sauces to my requests. THERE IS NOT A BAD DISH ON THE MENU that I have eaten- and since I eat there so often, It's fair to say I've tried a LOT of dishes-my favorites- BULGOGIBASIL SOY CHILIand for you seafood lovers -SEAFOOD with a medley of shrimp, scallop and squid in a light ginger soy over Chinese bok chop-so Yummy!!Also don't forget the delicious spicy Udon seafood  noodle soup - entire meal in itself!Most importantly, if you ever have an issue, or  need a dish to be modified, don't hesitate to ask for the 2 efficient ( & cutest ) Managers - Luis and Frankie - these guys will do everything in their power to get your meal just perfect!! All round, the best dining experience for your taste - buds and pocket-You will definitely recommend it to others & come back for more!!!"
3/20/2014,5,"I think by now I could be called a sushi expert and this place is top notch for my foodie flavors.  The Una don bowl is fantastic at 9.95 and comes with  eel, rice and seaweed salad.  Plenty to fill me up.  And the best part is they are open until 11:30 on Friday and Saturday nights.  Service has always been top notch.  Just wish it were closer to home. Oh well, Cant have everything."
3/15/2015,3,"I've been coming to bento for a while now and they've recently changed the way they do things. It took forever to get our food, much longer than I've ever had to wait before. The service was poor, but luckily the food is still good."
10/1/2016,1,"After years of eating here I am done! The service in this place is appalling. The host that sat us literally started arguing with us over our table preference. Long story short, out of the 20 tables open the only one we were allowed to have was next to the bathroom. When I finally asked to talk to a manager out of embarrassment by the manner in which she was acting, turns out she is the manager. We left and went next door for sandwiches. Much better."
11/4/2010,5,"I love it! I was a little worried that it'd be like every other Asian restaurant. The staff is soo helpful and they make my order in a quick,timely manner.  The atmosphere is soo comfortable and it's a really clean place."
1/31/2014,3,"This place is alright.  Their entrée dishes are actually pretty good, but I've had better sushi at other local spots.  Warning, they get really busy during lunch so if you're looking for something quick try Jimmy Johns next door!"
11/10/2014,5,"Quick, pretty inexpensive and so filling!  One of my go-tos for a casual get-together."
6/11/2014,5,"Bento is awesome! I love their hot and sour soup, spicy cream chicken, and shrimp tempura! The atmosphere is great, the service is great, the food is amazing (as long as you eat in the restaurant)! I'll keep coming to this place for a long time!"
7/29/2014,5,"I absolutely love Bento Cafe!  They offer cuisine in every dish served.  Not only that, but they have an array of flavors for Boba Tea :)  It's pretty hard to narrow down my favorites,  but I have at least 5."
2/1/2014,5,I just moved to Orlando from Los Angeles and I love Bento. Best sushi ever!! I really love the happy hour pricing. I totally recommend you check it out!!
5/12/2016,5,Been coming to the sand lake location for years. Pretty sure I've tried everything on the menu and it all tastes amazing. The free appetizer from Yelp is always a plus! Love everything on the menu and the green tea boba smoothie is pretty amazing.
10/1/2018,4,i love bento its great i always come with my sister whenever we crave sushi and boba ive experienced with other items on the menu and so far not disappointed the bulgogi is so far my favorite cant wait to try other dishes i am sad that some signature sushi was taken off the menu such as gucci roll or the crab roll but nonetheless i personally love bento cafe i say give it a try
5/4/2014,5,"Great prices for quality sushi! what more can you ask for? How about some warm or cold saki, or some boba tea? love this place..... Definitely my favorite sushi joint!"
6/27/2016,2,All my favorite workers left so now all the workers there are new and don't know what to do or how to serve properly. The food is average. Wouldn't recommend.
11/7/2013,3,"I used to love this place. I would get the spicy tuna salad and the envy roll, the thing is, the fish isn't that fresh. Sometimes it's chewy or colored weird. Because of that I don't go here anymore, and I wouldn't suggest having raw fish at a place like this. The bento boxes are fine, and they have good boba teas. All in all, if you're not getting raw fish, it's a good quick lunch place."
11/24/2014,5,"AWESOME FOOD AND SERVICE! It was my first time and I will definitely go back. Entrance, lobby dining room, and bathrooms where very clean. My servers name was Kenny and he was super friendly and attentive. I had Spicy Cream Chicken on Fried Rice and it was great. The food was very fresh as well as the crab ragu made in house same day. I will say was the best I have ever had. Definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. If you are not in to sea food or sushi they have a variety of different food that is great for everyone!"
9/11/2014,3,"Coming from Hawaii, Ahi Poke is definitely one of the local dishes I miss. Bento's Ahi Kobachi (Tuna Kobachi) is hands down comparable to the Hawaiian Ahi Poke."
6/14/2014,2,Too expensive and they need a pest control company. Not clean
1/8/2016,4,love the sushi and the yelp deal.. just wish their wifi was better!
11/1/2013,1,"Inexcusable service.  Having dined at Bentos dozens of times in dozens of locations this is the first time that I have experienced a truly unacceptable level of service.  With over 15 people in line to order lunch both cashiers were taking long complicated phone orders, and ignoring the growing line of customers in front of them.  Instead of one cashier working the phone and the other working trough the line, they both were busy ignoring the in store guests.  With tables full and the AC not working at a comfortable level the restaurant was unbearable and had we not made plans for a business meeting to be held here we would have walked out.  Sadly this will be the last time we will use this location for a meeting."
7/25/2012,4,"Great suishi for being downtown.... I liked the lemon crab sushi best, my friends always get their bento boxes and they have an all you can eat sushi day, think either tuesday or thursday.... although you can't share and you have to eat the roles one at at ime and eat them all or you end up paying for what you didnt eat extra.... Fun place to go if your already down town but not my favorite sushi place of choice...."
3/27/2012,4,"Love Bento's!Sandlake's Bento Café at Restaurant Row is part of a chain that is based at Gainesville. Since it opened is packed with locals.

Certainly worth a visit!"
8/3/2014,3,"I ordered the sushi combo box and steamed dumplings. Overall, the rolls were just a little too bland for me. The rice did not taste like sushi rice and the quality of fish was lacking. I have had better experiences at the Bento Cafe locations in Gainesville."
5/6/2014,5,"Very friendly staff and great selection of bento boxes, rice bowls, and sushi. I also like how it's quick service when I come for lunch and then full service during dinner. Great concept. Don't forget to check in on Yelp and get your free appetizer."
9/19/2013,3,"The service here is always a little iffy, but the menu is large and has a wide variety of options.  The sushi here is good, but a little bit on the pricey side; whereas the bento boxes are filling and an awesome value (noodles, salad, rice, a small dessert, plus an entree for $6-$7).  My favorite thing about Bento Cafe?  The boba tea.  Thus far I've tried the almond and the coconut, and both were refreshing, delightful, and overall delicious."
7/22/2016,2,"The food is great don't get me wrong, but the service is horrible. Every time I go they always mess my order up, and my order is not difficult at all( Teriyaki Chicken with plain noddle's) I only come back for the food but I hate the service."
2/13/2012,1,Bad food its like chinese take out very oily sushi tastes like cardboard i've been here couple times trying to give it chances but i always turn up disappointed with the highschool like employees that don't know anything about boba tea i was told that all of the boba teas including mango contained milk??? Idk anywho i stayed away from this place for 7months went back just bc i wanted boba tea and they were out of stock on the little tapioca bubble in the boba so i was mad then the waitress moves so slow. Then i got dizzy and sick after eating bc the food was very oily and greasssy like panda express drive thru food. If u want chinese greasy like takeout that claims its japanese go right ahead.
4/26/2013,4,Bentos is a perfect spot if you are looking for good affordable sushi. The price indicates quality not the best sushi in town but a top competitor in its price range. They have a great variety of rolls tackling every flavor you are looking for. You can even create your own. They have amazing TUNA Nachos. SO GOOD. Must get it. The service is hit or miss but the Sushi is worth it!
6/1/2015,1,"I don't even know what their food tastes like. All I know is, I ordered delivery 2 hours ago, and it's still not here."
1/17/2014,5,"This is one of my regulars!  I would probably eat here every day if I could.  The prices are super cheap!  And yet the food is so good.  My favorites are the noodle soup bowls, the Chirashi bowl (sashimi over rice), and of course...bubble tea!!  Today I had the sashimi and realized that the quality was as good when I was in Tokyo!  Very fresh.  Oh and the service is always super friendly.  Enjoy!"
2/22/2016,1,"They have a terrible service for such good food, it doesn't make any sense to have such good food for this horrible service. I went an hour to pick up my daughter's order considering she's been sick for three days and only wanted bentos since she is in love with the place and goes at least 2 times a week almost and hadn't gone in a while. When I get beck home after an hour, they missed the rice she order and turns out they didn't hand it to us. I call them and ask them how it is that they're so careful to be sure they bill me for everything but are not careful to make sure they hand the customer everything they payed for, most of all after driving for an hour just to get the food. The manager Carie told me they were sorry and that I could pay for a taxi and an extra order to get my rice and i find it truly unbelievable since the mistake was theirs. They ended up just telling me they'd make a credit for the rice for next time I went in."
2/19/2014,4,Over all a good experience. Yummy Flying Dragon Roll (minus the crab) and garlic edamame's. It's a very nice place for a late afternoon lunch. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. I'd just prefer if they came and took my order as opposed to ordering at the counter.
1/30/2010,4,"This was my first experience with sushi at their downtown Orlando location and fell in love!  Their location on Sand Lake has been a little slower to take off, but the food is phenomenal at a really great price.  My only complaint is that the last few times I've been in, the service has been extremely slow - but the food is worth the wait :)"
11/26/2012,2,My second time to go. The food was incredible!!! The service not so much. The wait staff acted as if they just couldn't be bothered. Plus we waited about 35 minutes for food.
4/23/2012,4,"We got lucky and found this on Yelp right after a long day at Universal . It was the best food we've had since we got here ! Great prices , food selection and service! And the free appetizer was nice on the check- in!"
10/23/2012,2,"For my first time eating here I decided to have a take-out which wasn't quite what I expected. Food had pro's and con's. Our food must have been sitting around for a while because when I got home and tried my curry on rice it was so dry. The rice had soaked up all the curry sauce and it became all stuck together. I definitely reccomend more sauce or even the sauce on the side would be even better. It did taste good but had no sauce.The sweet and sour chicken was yummy but again had NO sauce. I definitely will need to ask for extra next time because the rice was pretty bare.Next, the mongolion beef was good but VERY dry and hardly any sauce. Like I said, next time maybe going in there would be a lot better but the take-out food shouldn't be how I received."
4/5/2016,5,"We were staying at a local hotel and wanted an Asian restaurant with later hours and this came up as a good choice and we were very happy we tried it. Great menu with lots of different choices including bento boxes, rice bowls, sushi and very flexible ways to combine them. Prices were great and restaurant has a good vibe and later than avg hours. We liked it so much we came back the 3 other nights we were there! Also, Yelp had a free appetizer coupon which we made use of."
6/14/2018,2,"the service on Take-Out orders is awful. we order for our office almost every week, and they've YET to get it right. there is always something missing: an entrée, the sauce, condiments, a component of the meal - that is REALLY important. I'm done"
7/22/2013,3,Sushi ok...nothing to write home about. Noodle soup bowls are excellent. Very affordable.
8/23/2012,4,"Great place for Sushi. Try the box sushi lunch to try a few different rolls. Order and pay at the counter first, take a number and your sushi is brought to you in a timely manner. Perfect for a quick lunch!"
3/17/2018,1,"I am extremely disappointed in Bento. I have been coming to this location since the first year that they opened. I am a frequent loyal customer until now. I walked in and asked for a couple of changes to the items I wanted to order because of allergies and preferences and the manager (Deana) who was extremely nice but still could not help me! How is it possible to have a manager that looked like she did not know how to help me! Disregarding all of that, my wife who was starving had to run to Zoe's kitchen to eat because Bento could not make pork fried rice. She left to Zoe's, ordered food, ate her food, and came back 40 minutes later and we still haven't even received our food! On top of that several of customers that ordered after we had, got all their food before us. Keep in mind, we only ordered two things. The staff looked flustered and it wasn't even rush hour or busy. My wife, son and I tried to come in early before they were busy in order to avoid the rush. Which we did, so we were very disappointed to receive our food an hour later. As I said before the staff seemed very frustrated and clustered. There was staff yelling at each other and arguing. This was by far the worst experience I had at Bento. I was just happy that the manager Jade was not there because Deana was much nicer. I just felt confused as to why she wasn't able to help me. She gave me a discount for waiting that long but that's not what I wanted, I don't want anything for free I just wanted my food on time and a good experience as I always used to have when the manager Mica was there. Ever since she left the place has gone downfall."
3/11/2016,4,"I ordered a specialty roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were delicious. I did not care for the fried gyoza, as they were a bit over fried. My server was decent; nothing special but nice and attentive."
8/14/2013,4,Great portion size. Hit the spot with just the right amount of spice.
1/26/2013,2,"Ok food. Nice concept. Not too bright server (when asked if they have Coke Zero i was told, no, they only sell Coke products)"
9/24/2012,4,"I have to say that I absolutely love this place.  I always get the bento and am never disappointed.  Their Bulgogi is so tasty and tender.  Their staff is always friendly and attentive.  Great place, amazing food, and awesome Customer Service.  Keep up the great job Bento."
8/13/2012,2,"Nice location near I-Drive in the Rialto plaza. I came here after reading the reviews and my wife saw that they have vegetarian sushi rolls that seemed interesting to her.  We walked in and were kind of confused as it said please wait to be seated, but there wasn't a host or hostess, and it looked nicer than a diner that usually has those ""wait to be seated signs"". It wasn't a long wait until someone came and sat us in the back corner of the restaurant. I understand that as a couple you want privacy, but I really dislike being sat in the middle of a low traffic area because I find that usually we are forgotten.  Waiter came promptly and asked us what we'd like to drink, we had the unsweetened black tea that came out of the soda machine directly behind my wife. They were served in plastic cups which I found a little off putting since some of the rolls on the menu were as expensive as say a swanky joint like Seito down the road. I expect plastic cups at fast food places, not a place where I'm shelling out $50+ for a meal.  Our waiter disappeared and we literally had to flag down a waitress passing by to order our food.  We had a free appetizer for Yelp check in (Thanks Yelp!) and got the spicy edamame. It tasted almost as good as Roy's edamame which is super delicious. Food came out at odd times, her salad came out almost immediately, and my hot and sour soup came out maybe 5-10 min later. I found this also off putting since my wife waited patiently til I got my soup to eat her salad. Nothing special about the soup or the salad. The waitress that served my soup however was just shy of rude, I don't think she meant to, but she was a little rough with handling the soup and kind of threw napkins on our table and said ""here ya go"" . Our sushi came out next and my wife had ordered both of the vegetarian ones on the menu and loved both of them. Which is a shame, since she rarely finds places that cater to her with veggie sushi that is creative and I am not particularly impressed with Bento so the chances of her getting that sushi again are slim. I had the TNT which for a $10 roll was an afterthought. I actually wouldn't recommend it, it was kind of tasteless and it certainly wasn't spicy as advertised.  I also got the chirashi which I thought was an excellent value. the fish was good and pieces were large but the rice was kind of gross as others have mentioned. The biggest reason for my 2 star review is that I asked what came in the Chirashi and everything was fine except mackerel. I am not a fan of mackerel so I asked to substitute the mackerel for a piece of tuna, not thinking it would be a big deal.  When I received my bill I saw a .75 extra  tuna charge and a 1.50 substitution charge. All to switch out one piece of fish it cost me 2.25, which the waitress did not tell me when I asked for it.  I didn't see anything on the menu stating there would be a charge for substitution and I definitely didn't think I would be charged for an extra piece of fish when it was a substitution. There are much better places for sushi that offer higher quality ingredients and service. For as much as I spent there I could have gone to Seito or Mikado which are much better options. It's too bad my experience wasn't very good since my wife loved her rolls.  I would say go to Bento if you are getting their Bento lunch special or something cheap, but don't buy the ""executive rolls"" and definitely go with lowered expectations."
7/26/2012,2,"I love Bento Cafe in Gainesville.  I walked into this Bento Cafe and I was shocked to find a ""Wait to be Seated"" sign.  What?!?  The point of this place is its counter service.  Being forced to have a waitperson kind of defeats the schtick of this place.  I wonder why it changed?"
1/22/2014,5,Awesome service and reasonable prices! Huge fan of chicken noodle veggie soup! Bento boxes are great options too.
1/26/2012,5,"Gotta love Bento! Atmosphere, food and price is all great. I prefer their Bento box over their sushi rolls. My personal favorite is the Spicy Cream Chicken box.  Actually one night it was six of us and 4 of 6 ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken box - it's delicious! I think the portion size of chicken is a little more generous at the downtown location but I still come here all the time since it's so close to where I live.  I highly recommend, you will definitely find something on the menu that you will like."
11/14/2012,3,Not bad Bubble Tea has been difficult to find in Central Florida.  This is just one of the few that have them.  Food is good buta bit pricy for the portion size.
9/2/2010,4,"this place is crazyyy. It's very moderately priced food, good portions, and large selectios! You get everything from thai, japanese, chinese, and korean! all dishes are around 7 - 9 dollars and you can either choose from the bento box, udon, or rice bowl. They also got boba tea! nice friendly waitresses and hostesses! Came here for the tonkatsu and it was one of the best i've had. the lo mein was pretty non edible.. sushi rice is really good and so was the unagi."
5/6/2013,1,Tried Bento last night and came away with food poisoning. I will never eat here again.
7/15/2013,3,"The sushi was terrific; however, my miso soup was served cold and I waited about 30 minutes for my meal to arrive. I will go back for another try because I enjoyed my dinner and again the sushi was very good."
2/8/2013,3,"First visit at one of these style cafes, since I stopped during the week it was fairly empty and the service was quick. As far as the food I expected more flavor, I got the chicken basil bento it comes with noodles, rice, salad and a small pound cake type dessert. They also have an extensive sushi menu. I would probably go for that next time. Lunch prices are very reasonable."
8/31/2014,2,"Food is great, very fresh but the service is very BAD! The staff is not nice at all, they all saw we walked in and no one came to greet us.. Only after 5 mins. Same with table service, took forever to be greeted. We told the waiter our order and it took him about 10-15 mins to put it in because he was too busy talking to co-workers. One other waiter was making fun of another table."
12/9/2011,4,"Bento is my favorite sushi spot. I love the ambiance of this place. They have an appetizer offer when you check in which made it even better. I try to go earlier in the day, because on the weekends and evenings they tend to get busy and the service isn't that great. I love the special mexican and gyoza!"
7/27/2013,4,Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Yummy and fresh food. Clean restaurant. Best boba tea in town. My family now frequent this restaurant about once a week.
8/31/2010,2,Gone ar the 2 for 1 sake Saturdays. :-( with the food being bland I can't recommend this place other than being more quiet than Bar Louie.
1/3/2011,3,"Nothing spectacular.  Just good, consistent food.  Sushi, salads, noodles, rice or bento boxes.  It's all pretty good stuff."
1/12/2012,5,I had not tried sushi before eating here and my wife convinced me to have some. It was amazing. The sweet and sour chicken is some of the best I've had as well. Visited here with two Google Offers that they took for a single table and all four in our party agreed...this is a five star restaurant in our books.
6/19/2012,4,"I've been to this place twice now, so that says a little something about the food.  The first time I went, I went with a group of friends who recommended the place.  I ordered their chirashi, salmon skin roll, and two others I don't remember.  My bf ordered the una don because he loves eel.  We each ordered some tea, I ordered the taro milk tea.  The drinks came out fast, the milk tea with the pearls were very good.  A lot of places I've been to in FL, the pearls come out very hard, but theirs was perfect.  The rolls were all very amazing and I am a big fan of their chirashi.  I've gone back to order the boba and try their pho because I had a hankering for them and didn't want to drive down to downtown Orlando.  Definitely NOT a fan of pho.  If you know pho, and been to many pho places, they always give you options of meat, serve you a separate bowl with bean sprouts, basil, and lime (sometimes mint depending on the place).  Everything was just plopped on there, the sprouts were semi-cooked, and there was no lime.  The soup was very good but the overall pho experience, (the whole assembling, fresh veggies, etc) was not there at all.  If you want pho, go downtown.  Their tune salmon nacho however, was AMAZING.  The nachos are made with wonton chips and they put raw tune and salmon on top, with some diced tomato and some spicy sauces.  I do highly recommend it.Overall I think the place is excellent for tea and for any sushi-based dishes.  They've got a huge sushi bar and I think that's what their main focus is about.  The prices for the sushi is decent, like any other sushi places, so I highly recommend this place for sushi, just definitely not pho.Service-wise, when I went during dinner time, we had to wait FOREVER for service and for food, but it is a very busy and happening place at night.  During lunch hours, you order the food, they give you a number, and you sit down wherever, and they bring you your food."
6/26/2011,3,Place is nice.  The bento options are good.  Sushi was OK.  We ordered the TNT expecting it to be hot but it wasn't.  Had to add alot of wasabi to get it hot.  But I would go back for the bentos.
9/20/2011,4,"When you first walk into Bento Cafe it seems like a hip place try. Its located on a nice section of ""Restaurant Row"" near Menchies and Bar Louie. There seems to be a good mixed crowd. A normal meal would range between $10-20. This is one of the few places I've found around here where I can get some Bubble Tea. The Bento Boxes are a great way to get an inexpensive meal. The only complaint I would have is that on some evenings, not even a weekend day, the service can be kind of slow. Overall Im happy with all of my experiences here."
2/26/2015,5,"Everytime I come here,I am always impressed with the food. Whenever family is in town I bring them here as well :-). Awesome good and atmosphere.  There spicy cream chicken is my favorite#"
4/11/2011,3,"It seems like either Bento's is going downhill in quality or there is no standardization of quality amongst all of the different Bento's. I've been a long-standing customer and uber-fan of Bento's in Gainesville since my college years at UF. However, ever since I moved away after graduation, the closest Bento's I've been to is this one in Orlando (whenever I'm in town). Two years ago, I went to this particular Bento's and had a bento box of mongolian beef which was amazingly good, but the presentation didn't look like the usual Bento box I was used to in G-ville. It was still good food though.Fast forward to last week, when I decided to return again and things have really changed. Some people walked up to the register and ordered, per usual Bento style, but others, including my group, were escorted by a waiter. Waiters are a change of pace to Bento's, and I thought it was weird but I enjoyed the change. There has been a sporadic boom of tables and chairs since I last went there, so it seems kind of difficult to get to your table once you get there. Luckily, I was seated at a table near the entrance. Otherwise, I would've bumped into everyone in the place. Change of service and scenery aside, my only real disappointment was in the quality of the food. The sushi my boyfriend had was OK, but the flavor and texture was slightly off. It doesn't compare to the little Thai sushi place by my house that has amazing sushi. I ordered the tempura shrimp bento box, and they finally used the traditional presentation I was used to at Bento's in Gainesville, but the food was ... a little lackluster. Their sauteed green beans are amazing as always, and their lo mein stir fry was great, but their jasmine rice was slightly bland and mushy, although not as mushy as the shrimp tempura itself. My boyfriend compared the texture to that of fish sticks. The shrimp was very mushy and had an odd flavor to it. It wasn't bad, per se, but a little odd. The salad on the side was meh (but it's always been that way) and the little fried desert puff was an afterthought. For the price, which is conveniently very cheap ( under 10 bucks), the food was decent, and it filled me up quite well (my bf had to finish the bento box for me, lol). However, it wasn't as great as the first time I went there, and definitely not as great as Bento Blue and Bento Red in Gainesville. I haven't been to those 2 in a little over 2 years now, but from what I remember, their bento boxes were the best. This one, not so much."
11/2/2011,5,Great sushi and even better service. I would highly recommend a visit to Bento Cafe - Dr. Phillips FL
6/26/2013,4,"Bento Cafe is great if youre looking for affordable yet tastey sushi downtown. I normally go here before seeing a movie at the cobb plaza, kind of a one stop shop for a date night."
6/28/2015,5,Really sucks when you have 4 people with separate check s they only say you can use one per table. .management on duty was a kid and doesn't know anything about customer service. So I moved to another table and ate by myself. Jerk. Talking about free appetizer from yelp
4/17/2013,2,"I've been to Bento over 100 times. Their original locations in Gainesville are great. Great food, great service. Now, lets talk about my recent experience at this Sand Lake location. It was disappointing and if I ever eat at this location, I will be getting take out.We arrived at the restaurant with a group of 20 people. We all traveled over 2 hours and everybody wanted to eat here. When we walked through the doors we told the hostess we needed a table for 20, so she started setting it up. We soon found that 6 more people would be joining our party so we asked if she could add anything on or if we could get a table near by. So she walked away and rolled her eyes and whispered stuff under her breath. So we all sat down and she said ""if you have anymore people they will have to wait at the door until there is more room."" After we got our menus it took about 45 minutes for them to take our order. During this 45 minutes all I heard was the hostess complain about how we were taking up all their space that they could have used for other customers. Now, if I am not mistaken, we are customers aren't we? We brought you in 26 people, each spending over $15. It wasn't even busy when we came in, so I have no idea why the hostess was complaining and rolling her eyes. We are giving you business. After people in my party discussed getting up and leaving because of the terrible service, the little hostess ran to the kitchen and did not show face until our food was ready. And even then she kept staring at my party and giving us dirty looks. What kind of people are you hiring bento?Our food was mediocre. Some people didn't get their food until the other people finished, even though the same things were ordered. Why couldn't they cook it all at the same time? Blah.Bento Sand Lake, you have ruined not only my experience, but the other 25 people in my party. What a shame."
5/28/2011,1,"We ordered take out. Katsu chicken udon soup... with breaded chicken? General Tso's Rice Bowl was the worst I've ever had. Chicken tasted old and was not even trimmed, soggy breading. Dumplings seemed like they were fried two days ago. Don't bother."
6/15/2011,4,"I have been eating there for the last several months and have enjoyed each meal more than the last.  Portions are a good size for the price and quality, and the atmosphere is great.  I think they thin out the sriracha sauce though since it does not seem to be as hot as other places.  Aside from that, I love it!"
12/5/2012,1,This used to be a decent place to eat until recently. Gradually the service quality diminished until my final visit. I asked for a table and could see that only five tables were used. There were three servers including the hostess. The hostess explained that it would be a 15 minute wait because they didn't have enough servers. There were only five other parties and two of the three servers were standing around by the register chatting instead of doing their jobs. I will never go back.
5/20/2013,5,"I always make it a point to stop by here whenever I'm in Orlando.  I've first gone to one of the locations in Gainesville, but since I'm in Melbourne now, I can frequent this location much more easily.  I personally prefer this location over the one on Orange Rd, since I don't have to go to the Mochi next door to get my beloved Honeydew Milk Tea like I have to there.I'm not a huge sushi fan, but they definitely have a number of options for people who aren't into sushi.  My regular dish is the Curry Katsu Chicken Rice Bowl.  It's absolutely delicious!  The portions are rather large, however, so I'm never able to finish it.  On rare occasions, if I'm feeling ambitious, I'll order the Miso Soup, which is also very delicious.I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.  It's conveniently located close to Universal Studios, so it's in a prime location for outside visitors!"
9/12/2014,4,it's a one stop shop of basic Asian comfort foods you order the way you like it and the make it
8/3/2014,2,I do love bentos but was somewhat annoyed that I couldn't get fried rice with my bento box.
8/1/2013,2,"Our office is close by, so we often in the past have eaten here for lunch.  The food is good, and the prices reasonable BUT I had a poor service experience the last time I went.  I realize that lunch is semi-self service, but I simply asked the waitress for a fork when she brought the meals to the table.  She looked at me as if I was bothering her, abruptly pointed to the service area, and told me I could get it myself. I didn't want to make it a big deal because I was in a large group of colleagues, but everyone at the table noticed how rude she was, and couldn't believe it!  We saw other servers bringing items to the tables.  Actually, I probably wouldn't have even minded getting the fork myself if the girl was a bit more polite about it. I'm not sure if I'd go back with my co-workers again....all over a fork.  Unfortunate, but there is no excuse for someone being rude to a customer."
2/3/2013,2,"I don't know what's happened to Bento or if it's just this location, but the food is nowhere close to the quality it's been in the past. I've been a long time Bento fan ever since Bento Blue in Gainesville. For some reason, whether it be management or staff, the food and service at Bento on Sand Lake is pretty bad.1. The server comes and takes drink orders and doesn't return for 15 minutes, even though we only asked for waters. 2. When we decide to order Milk Tea with Pearls, the pearls have a strange veggie after-taste. 3. It takes 30-40 minutes for our food order to come out.4. The hot food was flavorless.5. The sushi rice around the sushi tasted like normal white rice that was left at room temperature. 6. They give you watered down eel sauce and charge for it. 7. And all this time the server is nowhere to be found even though there are only 4 tables in the entire restaurant that are occupied. I'm not sure what happened, Bento, but the Sand Lake locations has become an increasingly disappointing venue to have lunch/dinner."
4/6/2014,4,"For the price and amount of food you get i'm a fan. My go to dish here is the curry katsu, always love a dish like this. The curry is very unique and has a decent spice to it . Although no my favorite place to go eat chicken katsu it's in my top 5 for gainesville at least."
4/10/2014,4,Easy.  Affordable.  Order at counter and then they serve it to you.  Lemon roll was different. Open all day which is unique in this part.   Most sushi places close at 3
8/1/2014,4,The food was delicious. It sort of feels like a mix between restaurant and quick service. It was very clean and modern and in a great upscale area. The prices are pretty decent for the portion size and quality of the meal. I've been back numerous times....and who doesn't love Chewy Boba Tea.
2/24/2012,2,"I was very disappointed with the quality of their nigiris. Prices are the same as if I went to a ""real"" sushi restaurant and the quality can be compared to supermarket sushi. I actually have had better sushi at Gelson's supermarket in California. The bento box was ok, therefore the 2 stars."
4/5/2014,4,My family enjoyed a late dinner at Bento Cafe. The best thing about this place is the value. Super affordable large shareable portions and lots of choices. The service was attentive.
2/25/2010,1,"We had the worlds crappiest waitress. She had a horrible attitude all night, blaming us for an order she messed up, slamming down our trays, ignoring us purposefully, talking down to us, and trashing us to her other coworkers...we will never return. Shame on you Bento for hiring such a pathetic waitress."
4/23/2010,2,"Discover this place on web last week. Decide to give it a try yesterday and it was not good! Same as other fusion deco asian restaurant, their food taste bland, salty. Service was bad, it took long time for people to come to serve! Noodle and chicken are overly cook, more towards burn!  I was there for spicy beef noodle soup~but I was disappointed, it was just a bowl with 3 pieces beef and small amount of noodle, no spicy, no salt, no sugar, nothing. prices are cheap compare to other restaurant around this area, but i rather spend more for the delicious food than spends less money on the awful one!"
6/5/2012,4,Visiting Orlando. Fresh sushi at a great price. Try the Mexican roll.
8/30/2011,3,We had Katsu Rice Ball and Katsu Bento Box. I liked them and I ate them all. Our waitress was nice and friendly too. Only the problem I had was that we waited for 8-10 to order(We didn't even have a water). It was before 4pm so it wasn't the busiest time in a day. We didn't have lunch yet so we were so hungry..
9/27/2011,4,"i liked this place once i entered. there were TVs (so i could watch football)! very fusiony. a good place to have lunch/dinner and the menu was useful. also there was bubble tea! the price is set for lunch and dinner, so doesn't really hurt your pocket. servers were courteous. i would say the only thing that prevents me from giving this place a perfect score is experience, because each time can be different, but i will def. go back here when i hit up Orlando."
6/9/2011,5,favorite hangout of mine. everything is really good for an asian fusion restaurant. happy hour during the weekdays have buy 2 sushi get 1 free. noodle bowls are excellent. the curry katsu pork is excellent. boba tea is good here too!
4/17/2012,4,"Went here on a Tuesday evening; it was easy to get a table. Service was friendly and prompt. Menu is very broad; lots of choices of sushi, noodle and rice dishes, and bento boxes. We had a little bit of everything: two different makis, a noodle soup, a bento box, a noodle bowl, and three drinks. All for only $50! Fresh, tasty food and a great value."
4/21/2013,5,"I came down to Orlando from Boston for a family vacation and I was told by many people to eat at Bento Cafe. Two of the four days we were here in Orlando, we ate lunch here. It was a great experience all in all! We got sat right away by a very nice hostess. Our waitress attended us very quickly and recommended some amazing dishes. Our waitress knew the menu very well. My little sister had an allergy and our waitress recommended a lot dishes for her that would not danger her. The food came out quick (we order a couple rolls and some bento boxes) and it was hot and prepared nicely. We got the same waitress twice (an Asian female named Kim) and she was very friendly and optimistic. She always had a smile on and she seemed to be very alert. The whole staff was alert both times we went. She always checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. She recommended some boba teas for my little sisters and they absolutely loved it. We got 2 strawberry blended ice with boba for them and I got the vanilla milk tea with boba.I don't know if it our waitress or maybe the staff for both times that we had went, but i had a great experience here, along with my whole family. If i had the chance to come here again, I definitely would."
7/31/2009,2,"I have been to this particular Bento Cafe three times, and each time it proves to be just as disappointing as the first time, nothing has changed. Yes, the price is decent and the decor is modern and hip. However, the service and food is below par. Maybe I'm being a bit too difficult,  but I do not understand why I am tipping when I'm getting barely any service. The only time I see the server is when they come to bring me the food, and I have to go get the drinks myself in a flimsy plastic cup. They walk around and socialize, and not once ask me how my food is. I ordered some sushi rolls, that took way to long to come out. Mind you, I came in after the lunch rush and before dinner, there was maybe 2 or 3 other tables there. I do not understand why it takes so long for a three sushi rolls to come out. Not only that, it comes out one by one. I find myself finishing the first roll, waiting a good 10 minutes for the second roll, and then 5 minutes for the last roll after I finished my second. And when I look over to the sushi bar, I see the sushi chef laughing with the server and not making my rolls. Unacceptable. Their bento box is nothing to die for. In the description, it says you get noodles and other sides. I didn't get any noodles and one side of beans. Let's just say I will never come back again, I've been here 3 times and each time I've waited way too long for my food when each time it wasn't busy and the service barely existed. Let me just say I'm not anti-Bento at all, I've been to the one downtown several times, as well as the one in gainesville, and each time I left happy and satisfied. I rather make that few extra miles to the downtown location where I know I will never be disappointed."
8/16/2010,5,The sushi was fresh as always and the udon soup was great. My friend also had the pho noodle soup which he said was great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants fresh sushi and great noodle soup
5/8/2012,3,Same as place downtown but very slow at this location. Food is good but it seems to always take 30-40 minutes for food after ordering whether the place is empty or full.
6/6/2011,3,"their gucci roll is good, some servers look like they wanna die but its cool i guess if u wanna eat in a grave yard"
11/18/2022,4,"We were in the mood for some Asian food during our road trip so we decided to checkout Bento Asian.Here's my take on the experience:Quality of food:  Good. We tried the Bento Box that came with white rice, ginger salad, lo mein, and garlic string beans. For protein, we chose the general tso chicken which is wok fried with red and green bell pepper. We also got a side of two egg rolls. The garlic string beans were simply delicious. The general tso chicken could have been a tad bit crispier. The egg rolls, though nice and crispy, were encased in a lot of oil and I had to use quite a few paper napkins to soak it all out.Décor: modern. This place felt like it could be in LA.Cleanliness: good. The tables and the bathroom was clean.Service: good. Our cashier was pleasant and told us everything about the menu options.Price: expensive. The Bento Box was $15 which is a little steep considering this is a fast-food style restaurant. The egg rolls were $6 which is also a little bit more than expected. They also sell sushi rolls and the cheapest roll on the menu, spicy tuna roll, was $9 which is more than I have ever seen at just about any reputable sushi place.If you're in the mood for some decent albeit expensive Chinese/Japanese fast food then check out Bento."
12/12/2022,1,Awful awful!  Disgusting teriyaki chicken! Slimy and all dark meat without informing you on menu.  Will NEVER go back!
11/10/2022,3,"I was craving for some sushi and I really wanted to try something different than the last time I had sushi, so I decided to give these guys a try and to be honest I really enjoyed the signature Crunch sushi it  had tuna, crab, cream cheese, avocado, spicy Mayo, eel sauce and panko fried,it was very flavorful, crunchy  and tasty, so as for the sushi I definitely give it 9/10.The service in there needed some improvement because I called in and order my sushi  to avoid wait time and when I arrived to pick up my order I still had to wait  10 mins which didn't make any sense at all because at that point I might as well did walk in and place my order and waited. The ambience of this place was cool, nice house music going, the decor was pretty and colorful, the store was well cleaned (I don't know if it's because it was closer to closing time) but it was definitely nice and tidy and the bathroom was also clean only thing the trash needed to be taken out. I can say I'll definitely give them another try just to see if they will improve on their service. The service is only reason they got a stars deducted. Hope I was able to help the next person before visiting ."
12/13/2022,1,"I have ordered from here three times and two of the three times my order has been missing major portions of food. This last time we ordered delivery and ended up with 1/2 our dishes. We called the restaurant and we're informed we could come pick up the other half and told  ""they were busy"" instead of an apology for the error."
12/13/2022,1,"We have ordered three times from them, and they have messed up our order the last two times. The last time they completely left off the sushi portion of the order, which was most of the food. When we called to remedy the order, they were less than helpful. We don't plan to order from them again."
8/1/2022,5,Came here mid-day Sunday really craving sushi. Unfortunately this location was short on staff and couldn't serve sushi or poke bowls. We stayed regardless. I ordered the udon noodle soup with tempura shrimp and my husband ordered the curry chicken. Both were good. The staff was super nice and attentive. Atmosphere was spacious and clean.
8/14/2021,3,"I ordered the udon noodle bowl ($13) and red coconut curry bento box ($15), and both were very tasty and flavorful! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and they definitely gave plenty of extra soup broth. The bento was much more worth it in terms of value though, and I wasn't full at all from the noodle bowl.My main concerns were the fact that I had placed the pick-up order for 11:30am to avoid the lunch rush, and even though there was not a single customer in sight, they still brought the food out 5 minutes late. One of the staff members preparing the food was not wearing their mask as well."
12/19/2021,4,"Not sure why they have so many bad reviews. First time stopping in today. You order and then they bring out your meals. I got the milk tea boba (delicious, not too sweet and boba is fresh), I got the Hawaiian poke bowl (tuna, mango, red onion, edamame, over sushi rice), it was pretty good. They have a lot of choices on the menu. The hubby had Korean rice bowl and it was huge and he said it was very tasty. Look forward to coming back to try something else. Staff is very efficient and friendly!"
7/8/2022,5,"Fast, easy and tasty! I chose the poke bowl which was very tasty, my husband and my friends had fried rice which they also liked and the portion is very generous! For sure I will be back again to try other options."
10/15/2022,5,"Been here mutiple times and it has improved immensely. Was celebrating my confirmation with bento for lunch, and on our way home from church we got a call saying the catering order couldn't be made. Called Bento and they handled the situation seamlessly. Didn't have to wait extra time and they handled it all incredibly. Despite the slow UberEats order I just recently had, which included soggy spring rolls and cold food, their food is amazing and the UberEats was the problem not them."
10/6/2021,2,"I decided to make a pickup order during my lunch time since Bento is a good option for quick and healthy food. Unfortunately, it was not a pleasant experience. It took them my entire lunch hour to make just one bowl.I ordered just one bowl and went to pick it up after receiving a notice that my order was ready. Well, I arrived at the place to find out that they didn't make my order yet, because apparently they were having problems with the app. I was surprised but I understand mistakes happen so I was willing to wait a few minutes. While I'm waiting, I see the staff placing several take out orders on the pickup counter. Apparently, they did not put any emphasis on completing my order, which was already late, so it went to the bottom like it was a new order. This second mistake doubled the time of the wait and I only had one hour for lunch. It made it even more upsetting that no one from the staff tried to make up for the mistakes. They were avoiding eye contact eveytime they took an order out. I had to get their attention to ask what happened to my order. The situation was poorly handled all around. The food was good and ingredients were fresh but it was not a great bowl. Needless to say, I lost my entire lunch time waiting for a simple bowl. This location is in desperate need of better management and basic customer service skills."
11/26/2021,5,This place is great! The food tasted great with good quality and it was warm. The portion sizes are just right. The staff is friendly and the dining area and bathrooms were very clean. I recommend this place.
9/3/2022,1,Food was ok. Extremely high priced for what you get. They were also short staffed so they couldn't offer a good portion of their menu. Won't be back.
8/22/2021,5,"Ok so where to start...... if I could give it 10 stars  I would. extremely clean location for sure. Bathrooms and all!food was on point! I had the curry and it reminded me of my time in Japan! The food was served perfectly and tasted amazingly, Down to the egg rolls! Crisp and hot and flavorful. If you have picky kids like I do give them some chicken it's great and mine ate it up soooo win win people! I'd come back again for sure"
4/27/2022,5,"Love this place, really interesting foods/sushi and sauces. Foods seems fresh and made to order. The tile work on the wall sets the mood. Very casual and relaxing. Would be a good spot to chill."
9/8/2022,1,Very inconvenient that they don't accept cash. Not sure why they thought that would help their business or when people still use cash to tip their staff.
10/13/2022,2,"They got my order wrong and it took very long after when they said it would be ready, they added ingredients and left out others, overall would not recommend."
3/23/2021,3,"Stopped by for a quick dinner with a friend on a weeknight. We did dine in. The restaurant is very nice. I ordered a Szechuan chicken bento box, Tom yum soup with shrimp and lychee honey boba slush. The food is ok for quick service Asian food. My Tom Yum soup was spicy which was fine. Shrimp was not deveined... I enjoyed my bento box. The salad that came with it lacked dressing though. The portion was good as I had leftovers. Enjoyed my lychee honey boba slush even though it was on the sweet side. I would stop by for a quick meal if I was in the area."
12/10/2021,5,"Always a go to spot for me, love this place. But I wanted to comment specifically on the decor in here vs other locations. LOVE LOVE LOVE this brighter ambiance. Some of the other locations are dark, black and depressing. Will definitely come back to this one"
8/7/2021,2,"We've order from here a few times now, all through Uber Eats. I really wanted to love the food, but each time the food has been less than tasty and consistently leaves me with an upset stomach. It's also overpriced for basic Asian food."
2/7/2021,4,"Soft opening... We ordered a variety of things. We liked the Japanese bagel (JB bagel) roll the most, and thought the sauce for the pork dumplings was too salty. This location doesn't quite have all the dishes the other locations have, but I understand it's not located in the most populated part of town either. One strange thing is that they don't have tap water. Machine is not working, which is understandable during this time, but they could have pitcher of water to share..."
3/7/2021,4,We went yesterday around 6:20 the cashier was super helpful. We got a number and sat to wait. We got our food to go. It took about 42 minutes to get our food. We asked a worker if that was normal and she said yes when it is that busy. Besides that the food looked delicious and tasted that way too. I would definitely go back and get some more sushi or a poke bowl again. A great addition to lake Nona!  But I'll probably order ahead next time to skip the wait.
8/30/2021,1,24 dollars for a bento teriyaki chicken with extra chicken. First off extra chicken really? Might as well not paid extra. Chicken still had fat in it attached. Ginger salad looked sad and noodle tasted normal. Teriyaki was sauce on the side for the chicken so it's not cooked with it.What a disgrace!!!
2/8/2022,4,Overall always a clean and quick. Food is always great. Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the drink selection isn't the greatest besides this I love this spot and I have returned about 8 times already. Thank you again
5/17/2021,5,"Food was hot and delicious, service was prompt, and atmosphere can't be beat! Love the vibe in here. Can't wait to come back."
6/6/2021,5,Tons of variety of awesome foods from poke to sushi to boba and more. I especially love the interior vibe. That Koi fish ceiling is super cool!! Customer service is solid too. I just found out they have their own app - perfect for ordering takeout.
4/26/2021,2,"Went for the first time today.... I failed to look at the prices and spent $50 on 3 bowls, not realizing it was an additional $4.50 for fried rice in the bowl. I think it's just higher priced than panda and we weren't really satisfied with the food. I guess it maybe more suited for sushi eaters but if you love fried rice, this is not it. You're better off going somewhere more authentic and getting more for your money."
7/23/2021,5,"Oh it was sooo good. Driving through on vacation and the reviews looked good so decided to check it out. Didn't want fast food so it was the perfect sit down but not too sit down restaurant for our traveling meds: Order at the counter, they bring our your food fairly quickly and you move on. They were quick, food was fragrant and delicious and the place (including bathroom) was very clean. They even had staff walking around grabbing trays and trash. They keep a nice space there. Pricing isn't the cheapest but bento boxes, poke and sushi typically aren't for those looking for low-budget dining. Family of 4 spent about $60 including drinks."
10/7/2021,1,Just tried to dine in with my family of 5. We were told for dine in - we needed to order on the kiosk. I asked if that was the only option since it was our first time we were not familiar with the menu and she said yes because they're busy. We left and then witnessed them take an order for a single person that walked in immediately after us.
5/1/2021,2,Definitely not impressed!! I give the restaurant 3 in customer service but Food was definitely a 2 because it was Luke warm and tasted like it was a reheat. Looks pretty good but it wasn't what we expected.
12/6/2021,2,"The first time I went to bento was a week or two ago and I was so excited to find Asian noodle cuisine that could easily accommodate a vegan diet. The woman at the counter asked the cooks if the lo mein noodles were vegan and replied those. I was also happy to see rice noodles for when I prefer a gluten free option, but decided to splurge for the wheat lo mein noodles. It was good but wished I had gotten tofu.I just got back from there and everything has changed. The rice noodles are no longer an option, and the lady at the counter told me the lo mein noodles are not in fact vegan. This left the only option being udon which are not my favorite. She then described sriracha as ""sweet"" which confused me. She was really nice don't get me wrong, but the sauce I got (gochujang garlic) was not at all sweet, and very spicy. The lady was very kind in attempting to accommodate my vegan diet so this poor review isn't about her, but about the changes to the menu as of a week ago. I was highly disappointed to learn that any changes to the included vegetables would cost a lot more money and removing vegetables wouldn't deduct from the price. It wasn't very accommodating and options were limited. The last straw for me was opening my udon tofu bowl and seeing the amount of red/green peppers that were included. I counted.. 5 small pieces of red/green peppers. Picture included.Very disappointed with the changes and limited choices. Will not be returning, even though the staff was friendly and helpful both times."
9/28/2021,5,Seriously so much better than when they opened. Everything went to be going well. Great food . Ok price. We had bento boxes today and will be back. Seems like staff know how to take care of the place. Clean. Very nice.
12/17/2020,5,"I can't tell you how excited I am to have bento come to lake Nona. I been waiting for at least two years or more since they announced that they are coming. So I of course have to visit the store during their soft opening. It is still currently under soft opening as of today.  Came here twice for take out as they are still in training so their dining room is not open. To live up to the Yelp elite style, I try different ordering methods such as ordering in person and also through their online website for pick up. Both methods were easy to follow and seamless! The interior design is just spectacular and beautiful (look at that koi fish mosaic ceiling tiles). The space is very spacious and clean. The food is awesome and delicious just like their other branches. The staff knows their menu well and the whole experience were very well which I wouldn't have guess they are still working out some kirks or are training. Looking forward to visiting them on their grand opening! Be sure to check them out when you are in the area!"
1/28/2021,4,"Love the creativity of the bento boxes! Each box comes with a salad, noodles, crispy cinnamon chips, rice, and your choice of protein. I tried the Korean veggies and they were amazing! Good flavor but a little onion heavy, I was having bites of just onion and I still left some in my box. The pao pao chicken is their signature sauce and I can see why! It's incredible!!! It's creamy and salty and good on both chicken and tofu! It's a little expensive and they don't have a lunch menu, it doesn't really fill me up for dinner but I love it as a healthy lunch portion. I also got taro milk tea but they gave my chocolate milk tea instead - it was good, but not what I was hoping for."
12/17/2020,2,"I ordered this through door dash. I was excited to try it because it's nearby and looks cute. I ordered the mt Fuji sushi roll, and the sesame chicken bento box. Also egg rolls. The only thing I really enjoyed was my sushi. Everything else was not good. Although it was presented beautifully - awesome to go containers to split up the salad from rice and chicken . So to start with the egg rolls  : it came With 2 which was nice. However I did not like them at all.  The roll was not crunchy- it was ""mushy"". I ended up throwing them out. Now to the bento box: you would think it would be custom for a ginger dressing on the salad - but no, they used someSort of sweet and sour sauce as dressing. May work for some people, but DEF not me!!! The chicken was supposed to be sesame chicken - the chicken tasted fake and there was no flavor. It most definitely did not taste like sesame chicken. I could not eat this. The vegetables were green beans. Since when do Asian places serve green beans as vegetables ?! The only part of the bento box I liked was my white rice - which is the only food I ate out of the entire entree. A waste of $30 to be honest . Would I go back? Only for the sushi"
1/14/2021,1,"The name is very misleading, they don't actually have nigiri or sashimi (what Americans think of as sushi), they only have maki (rolls) and poke bowls.  Sign on the door says they require masks... how are you supposed to eat with a mask on? Seems dumb.  Very disappointed, I was looking forward to some good sushi."
10/22/2021,2,I am quite disappointed in the pick up service I got. I gave my name Sullivan to the African American lady and she said they were working on it. I came in at 4:45. That same lady put pick up order in window and I stood there for 25 minutes waiting for My order patiently. She then goes to kitchen to see what's up then asks me my name and I give it to her and she says oh it's here in the pick up shelf. She then told me she thought my last name was Solomon. My question is why didn't she check with Me after she received my order....and they weren't busy at all. I should have talked to a manager but needed to get home I've worked carryout places before and this was first time at bento and this had soured me in returning.
2/17/2022,5,I've been here twice now and the food was perfect both times. It's a new family favorite for sure.
1/10/2021,4,What can I say ?!! I love me Chinese and Japanese food. Especially chines take out. Bento gives me all of that without having that greasy feeling in my stomach once I'm done eating my combination number 7. The udon noodles are beyond delicious especially the sesame oil noodles. If you love dumplings then let me recommend to you Bento's dumplings that are incredibly fresh and tasty. So far we have ordered a number of times using the mobile app. Only feedback I would give them would be to have a separate section for online/mobile pickups and focus on some social distancing in the dining area. Other than that it's a solid place to go.
5/18/2021,4,"The food here is delicious, and their portions are very generous, but you WILL be waiting awhile to get it! This may be simply because they are a new restaurant, but I always wait around 20+ minutes for my food (which is pretty long for a quick service)! However their boba is usually done pretty fast, and it always tastes excellent. They have run out of large cups and honey boba before (twice, with months in between the two events) so you may want to call ahead to check."
2/20/2021,4,"Although I haven't had the opportunity to dine in at this new Bento location yet, I have ordered takeout from them 4-5 times already! Their Pad Thai is spicy and so flavorful. Their sushi is fresh and delicious, and I'm also a huge fan of their bulgogi! Bento boxes are a wonderful, affordable choice too. I'm excited to dine in once things ease up a bit with Covid, and experience the ambiance. Definitely recommend!"
6/4/2021,5,"Great food, the service is fast, and the workers are helpful! I'll definitely be coming back."
2/13/2021,5,I love Bento and am so glad that they've finally opened one in Lake Nona! I get the tofu wok fried rice and am always satisfied with taste and portion. Super yummy!
1/27/2021,1,"We ordered to go, and got to the restaurant at the time they said our order would be done. After waiting in line, we get to the front, and the girl says if you are picking up it's that line only. Almost everyone in the line was picking up, so they took a person way in the back of the line that was putting in an order.  Well, in the pick up line there is someone putting in a order which took about 10 minutes. So, the food is sitting there while we are waiting for the person to put their order in. If you are going to send everyone in one line to pick up their orders which takes about a minute to get the order and pay, why would you allow someone to put their order in instead of sending them to the other line!? So frustrating, they need to figure out a better process where people picking up can get in and out!"
2/27/2021,5,I have only ordered delivery from Bento and the sushi is always SO FRESH! Consistently delicious. My favorites are the Florida roll and Mex roll.
2/11/2021,5,Food was delicious!! The quality of the food and the price you get it for is a steal! Make sure to get the Mt. Fuji sushi!!!!
8/8/2021,5,Good food with good prices. Great boba teas as well! Staff was nice and covid friendly environment.
8/16/2021,2,"I like some of the dishes (spicy creamy chicken, for example) and sushi is decent, but this place had a bad smell.. like bathroom odor the last two times I tried to go. I thought the first time was a fluke, but it happened again and I left without ordering. I'm not about to order sushi from somewhere that smells rotten inside."
1/9/2021,5,Second trip to Bento. Poke bowl was great. Everything tastes fresh. Will return. Nice atmosphere.
4/26/2021,2,"Food is good but boy be aware of ordering during their busy hours!If you do, you'll possibly be waiting a very long time even when ordering through app! We witnessed chaos and 4 customers getting refunds. As we waited patiently and kept being told by very sweet associates may I add, that our order should be next. Well an hour and 15 minutes later we found out Order was skipped. Manager came and refunded us just like she did with many before us . It's unfortunate but it's been chaotic there since they opened and they can't seem to get it together. Staff in the front though is very very sweet!"
2/26/2021,5,"I've been going to Bento for years, mostly for lunch at the downtown location. I was so excited for the new location to open near my home and sinking my teeth into the delicious special Mexican roll for the first time in a year was just...magic. Food is just as good at this location. They have remembered all items for takeout and food has been ready on time."
2/3/2021,3,It wasn't bad.....it wasn't good either. It was just sorta average Asian food.  We all ordered boxes and some sides. Sadly we won't try it again.
1/24/2021,3,Arrived for take out.  Took 35 minutes to get 2 meals.  Tom yum soup was not edible.   Too hot to eat.  I like spicy and have had many bowls of this soup and this was terrible.
1/16/2021,2,"The food is the same quality as other bento locations. The interior is really nice. The service is, however, is not great. We have tried here (to go) 3 or 4 times. Each time, something has been wrong, either we have had to wait twice as long as expected or something was missing. The most recent time, we placed an order on their website and after 30 minutes arrived there to them saying they didn't have our order (and we weren't the only ones that this happened to that night)."
8/23/2022,4,"BENTOOOO! Bento has become my favorite place recently. My friends and I go quite often and it has become an all time favorite. We all have very different taste, but it accommodates us all. One of my friends like an avocado sushi roll and I like the most loaded roll there is but it works for us! Their pick up service is also very efficient especially since most of the food is cold so you don't have to worry about your food getting cold if it's supposed to be warm! Bento definitely satisfies my sushi fix!"
10/9/2022,1,"So disappointed in this bento location.  I ordered a poke bowl and soup for dinner tonight and upon delivery, I received one bowl that was completely different than what I had ordered. After receiving a refund, I tried ordering again, hoping that I might receive the correct food this time... to no avail. Instead I received another incorrect bowl with only half of the ingredients that I had ordered.  I didn't bother to get a refund this time because I'm sure they'd just think I'm trying to scam them, which is not my intention. Was hoping for the correct order, but I guess the saying ""fool me twice, shame on me"" is accurate here.  I am extremely disappointed in the lack of accuracy that this location has provided and very annoyed that I did not receive what I paid for."
11/9/2020,2,"Usually when I can't decide what to order my go to is either sushi or good o'l fries. I know sounds basic but not the point of this review. This place came in my recommendations and decided to try it out. I ordered fried dumplings and their sushi bento box. The dumplings were okay, definitely had better. The sauce that accompanies the dumpling had a dominant ginger flavor so for all you ginger lovers out there you might just like it. Now the sushi came in a cute and neat to go box. The size of the sushi itself was small which isn't really a nad thing. Along with the sushi you get a cucumber salad and a garden salad ( guessing ) which has this sweet-ish dressing which isn't bad considering I'm not into sweet dressings. I love spicy food. I ordered california roll ( this comes with the bento box ), spicy tuna and mex roll. They're okay, nothing with a wow factor. Definitely not what I'd consider for a Friday night feel good take out night."
5/3/2021,5,Absolutely fantastic! Bobo tea was on point! Sushi was fresh and delicious! Boyfriend loved his stirfry! Definitely a great place to get some authentic Japanese fast food for lunch!
4/24/2021,5,Ordered via door dash. Food was perfect. Thai tea was probably the best I ever had in my life. So flavorful and yummy!  Tuna and salmon poke bowl was great.
3/21/2022,1,I received the wrong items and I'm not able to eat what they sent. I contacted them and was told their system isn't able to send me a replacement. The best they could do was offer a partial refund???  Why would you expect me to pay for items that I didn't receive??? Please work out your customer service issues...
1/31/2021,1,After sending them the pictures and emailing back and forth after she asked me to send more info about the time of order and the card I used the manager never reimbursed my order. Pitiful and never again.
11/17/2020,5,"Accidentally ordered from this location instead of downtown Orlando bento on DoorDash which I usually order from cause I thought this location was closed. But to my surprise our 2 poke bowls and Orange chicken bowl (with extra chicken) tasted amazing! Everything was super fresh (raw fish/avocados) and I honestly got way more wonton chips and fried garlic and onion then I get at the downtown or university location. I love Bento chains, I've been eating there all throughout college the past 4 years and this location wasn't bad at all FOOD wise! This location is also closer to my apartment so I'll be ordering from here from now on!  I give it 5 out of 5 because my food was amazing and I think this location needs a higher rating."
3/23/2022,2,"Well, it was good for a while, at least.  But then they cut their menu and stopped caring about quality.  Avoid this location.  It's just crappy fast food now."
3/23/2022,5,"This place good as hell I can't believe I live mad close to this place and ain't no one tell me? Tofu good as hell! Veggie options good as hell, broccoli bussDOWN!"
10/5/2020,4,"Stopped by this new location on my way home from work one night. It was easy to order online and they had my order ready earlier them expected which was nice.  This is a take out and delivery only location. All employees I saw working had gloves and masks on which was nice to see. They had everything packaged nicely with chopsticks and utensils as well as condiments, they even included the extra sauce I asked for (eel sauce) for my sushi roll since it wasn't on their sauce list to get as an extra sauce. I got the Chicken Teriyaki Noodle bowl for my husband (no pics), a Bamboo roll for me which was really good especially with the extra eel sauce, I also got a side salad which was ok, the ginger dressing was good, but wasn't enough for all the salad they give you. I also got the Build a poke bowl which was awesome, just wish you could add more toppings (I like mine loaded lol). Overall it was good and we will order again I'm sure."
3/16/2021,1,"Called before ordering to see if it was possible to add grilled onions to an order. Lady on the phone told us we cannot order over the phone and that they only accept orders online but to add them online in a note. There was no place to add the note online so after placing the order online I called back and was told that if it's not available online, they can't do it...Weird way to lose my business and get a bad review. I'll continue going to the one downtown that is so significantly better than this location."
11/2/2020,1,"It's so sad. The food is great here, but the owner is a rude and angry man. I had been standing in the pick up area unacknowledged for approximately four minutes so I called out ""excuse me!"" Into his kitchen. He then emerged, not a ""hi can I help you? And said I should not be yelling at him in his restaurant. I had just come to pick up my order (which was ready at 12:15 and it was now 1 o'clock.) I must have mistakenly assumed that I could run in,  pick up my lunch and leave, without having to wait for him to saunter up to the counter with a really bad angry attitude. Unfortunately, I won't be able to eat here anymore, but I plan to go to another Bento box restaurant even though it's out of my way. It'll be difficult to swallow the lunch I just ordered( $50 for with a 15% tip for hopefully, his poor employees.)after this unpleasant experience. Good luck with your franchise, sir."
11/30/2020,4,Good sushi no complaints. Sweet staff and very fast service. Due to Covid I did a sushi dinner in the house.
7/19/2021,1,Disappointing Uber Eats order: missing sauce on entree and boba for boba tea. Cold food. Will not order from here again.
9/26/2020,1,"I ordered for takeout on Yelp.  Grubhub was supporting the order and sent me notice of time to pickup.  Order was supposedly ready but no one came up to hand it to me.  The waiting room was crowded.  I waited just outside the door.  The location is a shared kitchen for several restaurants - Bento Express, Lucky Dragon, etc. The food was cold and no taste.  This was a very bad experience."
10/4/2020,5,"Saw Bento pop up in the Conway plaza nearby and was super excited! I normally go for their bowls, but in the time of COVID when we're not eating out but more ordering in, and we're hesitant to order raw fish from too far a distance, I was having a craving for sushi. We ordered three rolls (the crunch, the special Mexican, and the hot lava) and the krab Rangoon. The online portal was easy to navigate, and the delivery was more prompt than the estimated time we were provided. The food was absolutely delicious! The portions were generous- we were both stuffed- and I was especially fond of the special Mexican. Excited to have this location in the neighborhood! We will definitely be ordering again!"
10/6/2020,2,"I was very excited to see there was a closer Bento Box near me rather than going all the way to UCF for it. I honestly should've just went to that one because this sushi does not taste fresh at all, and this is just an express chain."
10/9/2022,5,Amazing food amazing service. Coke machine is fire. Go here every week. Love it. Worth every penny and is well priced.
12/12/2022,3,"Katsu curry was watery, didnt really taste the curry. Other than that, food was okay. Good for a quick and affordable meal. Salad and dressing + green beans were yummy!"
1/6/2022,4,"I had no idea Bento served chicken katsu curry, and it was delicious! They have multiple options, but I think Japanese curry is the best pairing. The rice bowl has gone up in price considerably, but it's still a notable amount of food. I just wish they served more curry considering the disproportionate serving sizes. Since it was my first time at a larger location, I also tried the passion fruit boba and the Florida sushi roll. The boba is a little small for the price, but it was tasty! I also loved my roll, but they forgot the masago and the dipping sauces would have costed fifty cents extra...so it was a little plain taste-wise. Overall, worth the visit and decent variety."
4/19/2022,4,"Fast casual, fantastic food, excellent value. Bento is popular with students and visitors. The Poke Bowls were the favorite at our table. It was a quick lunch visit. The egg roll was so good, we ate it before I could snap a pic!"
2/3/2022,5,"My friends and family in Florida rave about this place and so I had to give it a try. The food is tasty and reminds me of all the comfort food I'd eat back when I was growing up in Japan.Even though its not the hardest thing in the world to make, I really loved their katsu curry. I can eat that all day. In addition to the curry, I also tried out their sushi and it tasted pretty good. 10/10 I'd def recommend this to a friend (which my friends did to me haha).Location wise, Bento is located right next to UCF so its very assessable to students!"
2/18/2022,5,"Had a yummy dinner at bento! First time here and it was a smooth process. The guy taking our order was knowledgeable and answered any questions we had. All the food was great, yummy, hot, and fresh! I'd come back here again, we'll worth it I thought!"
4/2/2021,5,"Is that a Sushi in your pocket.. or are you just happy Sashimi?? Uhh anyways.. lolHad some Bento delivered on this Friday and a good one at that!Got the Large Sushi Bowl - Tuna, Salmon, Spicy TunaToppings - Edamame, Jalapenos, Wakame (seaweed salad), Spicy Cucumber, Wasabi, CucumberAlso has pictured is a Jasmine Milk Tea w/ BobaThe Proteins and ingredients were fresh so there will be a Round 2 in the future!"
9/20/2021,4,"Surprisingly good food at this place. We ordered takeout and when we arrived the food was ready. That is pretty unusual. We got our stuff and went home. We got sushi rolls (some vegan and some with fish), a chicken katsu, miso soup and a red curry tofu bento box. I must say that I enjoyed everything, although the miso soup was a bit salty. I got a roll that had fried shrimp in it and it was really good. The red curry was also really good, and spicy. The bento box was a very good deal, and I really enjoyed it. I stole a piece of the chicken katsu and it was fried to perfection. It was also thick and well seasoned. We got a sweet and spicy sauce with it and it was spot on. Everyone was happy with their food. Solid 4 stars."
9/26/2022,1,"although the food here is pretty good, the service is awful. Not only did we wait 1 hour for our bento box, they employees gave us horrendous glares. 10/10 do NOT recommend... go knights charge on After further consideration they gave us miso soup for the inconvenience... 9/10 don't go here"
2/27/2021,3,"Bento is one of my goto places for quick Sushi. While quick is not what this location is known for. The flavors are consistent and fresh.  I would highly recommend calling in or ordering online. Even when I put in an online order my wait is consistently 15 - 20 minutes after the time they said it would be available.All in all this location is slower than other bentos I frequent. The restaurant is clean, and the food is really good. I enjoy the bento bowls and the tea."
8/10/2021,3,"I've come to Bento Box a couple of times, and the experience has been good, I have been there  before and during the pandemic and  they have been efficient, it's good, I order, eat and go, sometimes I get my order fast, other takes sometime, in general it's been ok.The last time I went, something happened that was kind of uncomfortable, not enough to say it isn't a good place, more like it has room for improvement. I went there a late afternoon with the family, with my  husband and my 5 year old daughter. I wanted to get some sushi and my daughter wanted some noodles, so we chose to go there because they have both. we went, I ordered the sushi,  and my husband order his meal and a noodle kids meal.  I paid, I assumed everything was ok, and sat. When we got the food, we see that we get rice instead of noodles,  and we let the server know, that we were pretty sure we ordered noodles because it was all the child wanted. We explained the server, and then looked into the receipt, which usually don't get  but that day we did, and yes it says that the kid's meal was rice. We assumed it was some sort of miscommunication, and initially the server told us that no problem that he will give us a side of noodles, and we were ok with  that. Then he came back and said that unfortunately, we couldn't get the noodles, that if we wanted we could head up and purchase the  extra side. At this point, I understand that yes,  I should have checked the receipt after I paid, and didn't, and I could leave it like that, or make my child eat the rice, or I could ask for a manager and maybe they could help, or get up and pay again for noodles. At the end, I decided for the latter, I went to the front and ordered an extra side of noodles. I could have asked for the manager, but I wanted to save my inner Karen for bigger and better occasions, even if I considered I was right, the server was being polite and the end it wasn't his fault, he was doing his job after all. It wasn't a big deal, other than I had to interrupt starting our meals. I can say that  whenever I've had a misunderstanding in other places, whether the food is mixed up or we get the wrong order, we usually get a replacement or the right meal without having to go through hoops. that was kind of like meh. I say it more with the idea that it may be improved for future reference"
6/16/2022,2,"Quality seems to have gone down and price seems to have gone up. So sad. Ever since they removed the Masago from the poke bowls it just hasn't been the same ((the picture is from when they used to have masago :,(  Haven't had a bowl like that since... heartbroken."
11/6/2022,1,"Food took 45 minutes to come out, I don't think the workers know how to do their job. Also, the food was overpriced and horrible."
11/22/2021,3,"Sure I would recommend this spot and I would eat there again. But there are better sushi spots without a doubt. We got some rolls and some noodles and I can say we were happy with our grub. They said 40 minutes till we got our food- we got it in 15, so that was great news."
6/10/2021,5,"I ordered takeout via the Bento app and I was pleasantly surprised that my order looked as good in pickup as it would had I dined in the restaurant even after driving home. Everything tasted excellent and the boba I ordered was made fresh and kept cold. Very refreshing to sip on during my drive home on a hot day. The bursting boba was very cool! I've never had that before and it was like a party in my mouth, LOL! Customer service was great and the tables were clean which is obviously vital nowadays but important no matter what. I'll definitely be back next time I'm near UCF."
10/27/2021,4,"So we're in Orlando passing the time as we missed our flight, and was hanging with my son who attends UCF.  We actually came the night before and we're really hungry and saw this place and thought - why not. They serve bento boxes, Pho and sushi, a winning combination! We tried their chicken teriyaki bento box and 3 rolls, special Mexican, Florida, and Mt. Fiji. The rolls were in expensive and we thought they would be overloaded with rice (to fill you up). They weren't and each roll were 8 pieces. The bento box came with a small thing of noodles, white rice, chicken teriyaki, wonton cinnamon type item, salad and green beans. For a college town, the entire total was rather inexpensive, especially for sushi, but the taste was out of this world! The special mex (I got it without the spicy mayo) was magnificent and the Mt. Fiji roll was SOoo good, you have to try. The Florida roll was also good. The bento box was pretty filling and it fed my wife and I rather well. If in Orlando near UCF and you want a really good Asian place, stop by here - it's literally across the street from the college! So stop by, you'll be glad you did."
6/19/2022,2,Have waited over 30 minutes for fried rice . Resteraunt is probably 20% max occupied . Yes they did warn it might take 20 mins . What I don't like is how there's four people standing around at the sushi bar chatting doing nothing while there's probably one person in the back actually working . I love bentos food but this is unnacceptable at this location . Also didn't have any bobas available they claim and when I asked if I should order a appetizer so I didn't starve while waiting they claimed there was no more of those either .
9/13/2022,1,"I has low expectations of this restaurant and the food exceeded them. It was less good than I imagined it could be. The staff were helpful, but I wouldn't go back for the food."
11/29/2021,1,"Hair in the food. This was literally the most disgusting thing that's ever happened to me while eating. This hair was so long and wrapped into the rice, I almost swallowed it & nearly threw up as I pulled it out of my throat."
1/1/2021,4,"It is my son's birthday, so the meal is his choice. This year he wanted something close to home, without fuss but it had to be good. He recently had tried Bentos with a friend & wanted us all to try it. Bentos is in a plaza across from UCF, sitting amongs other food places, so the parking can be sparse. We lucked out and found one right in front. As we entered I noticed the masks required sign, social distancing markings on the floor, the staff all wearing masks & hand sanitizer dispenser by the register. The tables were not separated enough but we chose a table for six closer to the door. Honestly, most people who came in after us were keeping distant or odering to go. We ordered at the register, we advised that it was our 1st time and she was nice and very patient. She showed us the different options, sauces and sushi. We ordered Mongolian beef & shrimp, with lo mein. Mongolian chicken with lo mein, pau pau shrimp white rice bowl, pau pau shrimp with lo mein & sushi combo box.The food was bought to our table pretty fast. It was all really good. I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of veggies, cooked well. Pau pau sauce os spicy, sweet, creamy. The Mongolian beef and chicken is really good.  The sushi is fresh, flavorful and awesome. We will return."
8/3/2021,3,"It's 4pm, and many items on the menu are out of order :(    My order was prepared in very short time. Food portion and taste is good. I wouldn't recommend milk tea, though. It's wayyyyyyy to sweet"
11/24/2020,4,"**Review of their Uber Eats Deliveries**I have ordered from this establishment through Uber Eats several times and it's been great! I love the options and how they have a great mix of items. Bento boxes are a great way to get a mix of foods you like all in one plate! I love their noodles and their chicken is tasty! They have a fun kid's bento box that our toddler actually LOVES. She enjoys eating the noodles and the chicken is basically their version of chicken nuggets. She is always pleased with the food she gets from here!It's easy to order on the app, and they deliver within the timeframe window they provide.Overall: AGood food delivery service - received hot and fresh and it's tasty!"
12/17/2019,5,"Come here once a week for lunch and have never been disappointed.  Portions are fair and great quality. The bento boxes are great!Updated 12/2019Still come here frequently, staff and food service still Great. In TnT roll is awesome!"
11/3/2019,3,"Arriving here around 11:45am on a Friday before the lunch rush was our luck! Shortly after arriving, the line grew extremely long. Plan your trip accordingly and make sure you have adequate time. I met up with my husband for lunch and decided on trying this place out. After a short walk from the parking garage, we entered and stood in line.  Only about 3-4 people in front of us, it felt like it was taking a long time to take their orders. My husband ordered the tofu yaki udon.  The noodles had a nice texture and bite to them.  This dish was satisfying and savory.  The ginger soy sauce that flavored the noodles was super yummy! I recommend.  I ordered the tofu pad Thai. Sadly, I was disappointed.  I've had pad Thai from many places, but unfortunately the flavor of their pad Thai didn't work with my taste buds.  I feel like it had a strong ginger like taste instead of your traditional peanut sauce flavor.  The nice thing about this was that it was a HUGE serving. I had tons of leftovers.  I'm sure the other choices on the menu are tasty, but I don't think this will be in our normal restaurant rotation."
4/6/2022,4,"Great food, wonderful, good value. There bowls are great and the bento boxes are delicious! I highly recommend the Bento's on University. Yummy yum!"
2/19/2022,4,"Presentation and taste of the food was great, only complaint was they didn't have boba. That being said I'll have to come back and try soon. High recommend if you're looking for something Asian for lunch, great flavors."
8/22/2019,5,"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, but I started seeing bad reviews, so I put it off. I finally ordered take out for my daughter and me and I was NOT disappointed! I was lazy so I wanted to use a delivery service, but the last order ends at 9:30PM.When I walked in to pick up the order, it was bigger than I expected and the bar area was really nice. I noticed that they have happy hour, but I never get out of work early enough to take advantage.My daughter & I each ordered a poke bowl. We had a certain amount of protein, toppings, sauce, etc. when my daughter created hers, she only chose 3 toppings, so the girl who took my order offered to double any 2 of the items!!! We were so excited and we savored every bite. We were not able to finish the whole bowl, so we had enough for leftovers."
12/29/2021,5,"I had the Spicy Donburi and let me tell you. This bowl is really good. It's a very simple bowl and it's flavorful. This is how all restaurants should be. Friendly, clean, and tasteful. P.S. I love their uniforms."
7/7/2019,4,"A fast casual Bento box place?! Where have you been all my life? Plus rice and noodle bowls and a few soups and appetizers?! I did the math and there are infinite combinations to order.Product quality ranged from good to great. All the bentos have the same stuff besides the main dish. I had the Korean steak which was good. Sauce tasted great (but could be a bit spicier!) The beef quality was decent but not amazing. Served with the standard salad with ginger dressing (really sick of this stuff!) A scoop of rice to soak up the sauce. Really nice side of wok fired green beans. I really don't know what to think of the cold sesame noodles. The flavor is good. Don't like it cold. I ate a couple bites but I wish I could sub it out with something else. A standout was the chicken katsu bento. Really perfect.  My son who's diet constitutes of only fried chicken and things covered in cheese loved it. Dumplings were good but the skins were too think and ""bready"". I still ate them all. Sauce was delicious which included some chili oil. Edamame were really good. Crisp and salty. Miso was decent but my son hated the mushroom slices. Odd choice but I bet I would have liked it.  But there are problems here. We ordered 3 bentos and 3 appetizers. They brought out the bentos first. Really? And the place wasn't busy. Very odd and definitely a fumble from the kitchen. And everything came out one at a time. I get it. The kitchen cooks something and sends it out. Still was odd. My wife's main was over salted. And as I said, the beef was ok quality. A bit mealy. Maybe over marinated? Given there are now infinite minus one combinations for me to try, I will be back."
7/3/2020,5,This was a DoorDash Saturday Support Your Local Business Order. I order sushi every Saturday since I cook all week long. Delivery was fast and the rolls were very good. I have to say the Spicy Salmon was my favorite. My husband got the Garlic Broccoli Bento box and the portion was very generous. Daughter got the Katsu Kid box and she approved.
7/4/2022,1,"Let's start by saying I ask if I can swap out the Cali roll in the sushi box. The answer was no and I'm fine with that I'll buy the rolls I want. I wanted a rainbow roll and a Mt. Fuji roll and I was completely fine with paying for both. I pay, I walk to my seat and everything is splendid. I receive a Cali roll (the thing I didn't want) and a rainbow roll. It's fine they messed up my order but I didn't not expect them to tell me it's basically my fault. I had to go pay more since the Mt. Fuji roll cost more(once again I'm fine with this but I didn't expect to pay more after i had already ordered the rolls I wanted). Not only did I have to pay for their mistake they then proceeded to take the Cali roll back that they had dropped off at the table. Now riddle me this bento, why would I pay $18 dollars for a Cali roll and a rainbow roll when I can get a sushi box($15) with a full Cali roll and just order 2 halves of a rainbow roll as the 2 four piece rolls you get in a box? That would give me a full rainbow and full Cali roll. Absolutely appalling."
5/8/2020,4,"My first time having a regular poké bowl. Way better than the hot food since the meats tend to be fatty (I don't like that.) so filling I had to take some home. Convenient location and service. It's quick, close, and pretty good. Not authentic but it's like a Asian chipotle. The fried to go food was hot and ready in advance."
10/10/2018,3,"I'm kind of sad. Let me explain... I'm a long-time patron of Bentos. As a Gator grad, I went to the original location in Gainesville not long after they opened. Then the second location in Gainesville. Then I worked in downtown Orlando for 5 years right after that location opened (and even paid for the sit-down service they forced in us on weekends). Now, probably about a decade after my first Bento visit, I live semi-close to this location near UCF. And it leaves a lot to be desired. I've been here a few times, and always leave feeling slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely edible. ...it's just not as great as it used to be. And the locations don't seem to have much consistency. On this last trip to Bento, I ordered a spicy cream chicken bento box with extra rice instead of noodles and white meat grilled chicken. They forgot the extra rice - which isn't a big deal at all, but the chicken was super dry, flat, and minimal. Luckily I was hungry and still scarfed it all down. They also didn't put the sauce on the chicken at all, but gave me a salad bowl-sized cup of it! I'm not sure why you would ever need that much sauce for a 1/4 cup of grilled chicken, unless you wanted to eat it like soup. (Seriously, I wish I had a picture.)When they first opened at the original location they also gave you these cute little cakes as the dessert in the middle of the box, but now they only give you those crispy wonton noodles with sugary glaze on them. It's obviously a cost-saving mechanism and probably easier, but it's just not great.Overall, it's just not as good of an experience - and it makes me sad to say that, but it's true. Hopefully they will get back up to par soon."
10/24/2021,1,"After a 35 minute wait one of the two meals that we ordered arrived. Several minutes later my meal arrived minus the request of ""no green peppers please"" ... green peppers were front and center. The chicken was mushy and the rice was dry and clumpy. The concession salad  offered for the long wait never materialized. I paid $16,00 for this lack luster meal and poor service. I can not recommend this establishment and will take my money elsewhere."
2/5/2021,1,"My husband and I are avid Bento goers and unfortunately this location was a disappointment. We ordered a poke bowl and boba TO GO at the counter and waited 40 minutes for our ""to go"" order. Keep in mind it's Christmas Eve, 8 ppl working and 2 customers in the store (plus us so 4 ppl total). My poke bowl sat on the counter for 20 minutes and my drink was given to me without my mango popping boba (I was charged for this). Upon receiving my already sat out poke bowl and telling the manager I was missing the popping boba he added it and we were on our way. Go to the Oviedo location it's a lot better!"
1/20/2020,4,"This restaurant serves bento box in interesting concept:  Asian cuisines.  You can choose your choice of meat and choice of way of cooking such as sezchuan, Korean, veggie stir fry or Chinese to make up your bento box.  They serve sushi too if you are into that.You make your order with the cashier and they will you a number for your table and they ll bring out the food out to you.  I went with my girl friends so we got one number.  I ordered tofu sezchuan and that was tasty.  It's not as spicy as the authentic sezchuan dishes but it was savory.  The portions are huge and it's pretty filling for dinner.  We got all that for roughly $12.00 per bento box.  I definitely will be back to try other dishes."
11/2/2020,1,"This place is trash, waited 35 minutes to get my food while I watched 2 people come in after me and Get thier orders which had sushi in them. (Not to mention like 14 take out orders) When I asked what was going on the girl told me that they were waiting on a 4 piece spicy tuna roll for my order.... this is some bad service and organization to forget my order and make me wait! I missed out on the sunset waiting for this while people who came later got much bigger orders! I regret tipping, PS this was 530 on a Monday night. Wasted my sunset for old food u can put together in a second. I'll put a picture of the 35 minute sushi 4 piece I had 1 of..."
3/13/2022,4,I really like going here but the service is bad. Which is really annoying because the food is good. Been here a bunch of time and every time my wife and I eat here our food never comes out together. I don't understand how a noodle bowl and sushi come out before a poke bowl with just chicken (that's cold).
7/19/2021,1,"Ledy: you are an horrible Yelp responser . Ask people to send emails and never respond, very bad practices. Since you are not the owner, so it is probably not your fault. But still, time to find another job, where you are appreciated."
9/11/2020,4,"Bento has always been my go-to when I'm craving fast and consistently delicious Asian food! This location always tends to be busy and I like to order ahead online to avoid waiting in line forever. They happened to have a promotion where you can get a free mini poké bowl with a $25 online order and I took advantage of it last night bc my sister loves poké bowls! I ordered two chicken katsu bento boxes with red curry (10/10) for my bf and I, a special Mexican roll (5/10 - the rice was way too mushy) and a teriyaki chicken bento box (9/10) for my sister. For the poké bowl, she customized it & got salmon, mixed greens, cucumbers, avocado, wakame, cream cheese, & jalapeño & scallion with ginger dressing (8/10). All in all, would totally recommend if you're in the mood for fast Asian food that never disappoints!"
12/5/2019,4,"The food is delicious!!! My faves/go-to menu items include:-Spicy Yellowtail-Spicy Tuna-Mex Roll-Beef/Steak Mongolian Rice Bowl-Pork Dumplings-Thai TeaThe only thing that deters it from a 5 star is the wait. It's ALWAYS BUSY at this location. If you're hangry, have a small snack before coming in. Also, I can't even get the delivery option from here anymore!"
9/16/2019,2,"So this place is pretty terrible. I only went here because I received a coupon for $3.50 off of a chicken bowl... bringing it to five dollars for the bowl. A pretty good deal until you factor in the food...I had to get a refund on my soda, because the drink was out of about 2/3 of the sodas. The picture looks good, but this is a bowl of plain rice, with what appears to be microwaved frozen broccoli, and some nasty chicken. I can only assume that they soaked the chicken in a soy sauce marinade overnight and then boiled it the next day, Although I think they called it grilled teriyaki. It came with a cup of teriyaki sauce which I quickly poured all over the chicken, but it really added nothing but moisture.I have no idea why this place is so popular, it was quite crowded at lunchtime. Pei Wei is just down the road and infinitely better"
10/5/2019,5,"Loved the Bento Box! I had the Garlic Broccoli with Chicken box, very delicious! It comes with Chicken, garlic flavored broccoli, white or brown rice, ginger salad and string beans (see photo).Very friendly service and clean restaurant.They are busy at lunch, but the wait was not too bad. You can pre-order to skip the line and save time."
9/27/2020,5,"My husband & I have ordered twice from Bento. Each time, the food was delicious, perfect temp, and ample. I ordered the ahi poke tuna bowl, hubby ordered General Tso's chicken. Sooooooooo good!!!"
6/23/2019,2,Today we stopped in for our favorite Japanese curry bento box and rice bowl - and were extremely disappointed! The curry was watery & liquid. It was not the curry sauce that we usually are used too. It left a watery soggy mess in my bento box. I didn't order a curry soup! Very disappointing experience today. Something went wrong in the kitchen!
11/29/2020,3,So i have been withokding my review on this place for a month now because i assumed it was a freak mishap... but today they messed up for the third time. This review is for today... first off the place isnt packed. Yet for some magical reason they messed up my order. They complemented me with another soup as a apology... however while i accept this apology... i kinda expected the following.... slow service rude staff poor covid19 control. To simplify my review... food good... service and accuracy of taking order is complete poop.
1/24/2021,5,"Bento has been my favorite sushi joint for years. From their bento boxes, to their sushi, to their bowls, I've never had a dish I dislike. Everything is so fresh and they have a variety of sauces to choose from. The TNT Roll and Volcano Roll are my favorites, and you can't miss out on the Spicy Cream (Pao Pao) chicken noodle bowl! You cannot go wrong with ordering from Bento so try this place out! (And please expand up north ASAP!!!)"
12/28/2021,2,"I like the Sushi from here, but when I order on Uber Eats, they quote one time for delivery and it keeps changing! Allot of the time waiting 2 hrs for the food! Reason why? They pick up 2-4 orders and mine is usually last to be delivered! Bad customer service. Vendor blames it on Uber Eats. Wake up and complain to them!"
9/24/2020,5,What a delicious treat! Ordered through DoorDash and was so excited to receive my meals. Everything was so tasty.Definitely ordering again!
5/17/2017,4,"I frequent the Bento located in downtown Orlando quite often so I one day I decided to try the East Orlando location. The selection of food is good; however, I always order the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box. Don't let the name fool you, it's not spicy. Per my usual, I substituted the dessert for additional rice (you can also do noodles). Their bento boxes come with a good amount of food, even for those growing boys. This particular Bento has open seating all day. Both times I have been to this location the seating is selective because there are multiple tables with dirty dishes that have not been grabbed. Also, keep in mind that this place is hopping on a Saturday night. You will have to wait in line to order. Food - AService - COverall I always have a delightful meal when I go to Bento."
11/18/2020,1,"I understand charging extra for sauce so people don't take advantage but $0.50 for one extra tiny sauce is outrageous. Just two little cause cups is $1 on top of me already spending money for a bowl that doesn't come with enough sauce to begin with. On top of this, I had to pick through my salad because it has some brown lettuce."
8/21/2021,1,I try to always go to the winter park location which is so much better but today we were in the area of the UCF location. I ordered my food at 4pm and they said my order would be ready at 4:20. I showed up at 4:45 and was told that my food still was not ready! This Bento should get an award for always taking forever to make your order regardless of how busy they are.
5/23/2017,5,"Came here with my daughter in hopes it was as good as the downtown location. No disappointment at all. I had this salad bowl with Salmon and added some veggies. I can't describe it much more than it had this spicy mayo, lettuce which was very fresh, seaweed salad, tomato and added a little eel sauce. It was heavenly. Order at the front, take a number and have a seat."
7/21/2019,4,Check the menu and many choices.Been here twice and not bad. Close to home. Very filling if you are hungry.
11/12/2019,3,"I ordered the pineapple chicken bowl, sushi, and a miso soup. The pineapple chicken bowl was good and tasted fresh. I was not a huge fan of the sushi and ended up only eating a few of the rolls. I found the seaweed was rather chewy and there wasn't much flavor in the sushi. The staff was very friendly and accommodating when I asked if I could add on a soup quickly to my order, after we had already checked out. The miso soup was pretty good, far better than the sushi. I am NOT a fan of the size of the soft drink cups. I hate having to constantly have my drink refilled because the cup is so small. Overall good experience but not necessarily my new go-to place."
4/10/2019,5,"Casual, simple, good comfort-foods, and fast service!? Yes. I love Bento's! Whenever I am craving Asian foods but do not feel like driving far out, I would always go to Bento by default. Why not..! The foods are awesome, taste amazing, and the services (Sand Lake and UCF location) are outstanding! The environment/atmosphere here is perfect for group gathering and social event, even for kids. Casual date night is okay too. During lunch hour and weekend nights, especially the one located nearby UCF, the restaurant can gets really busy so come accordingly. If you do not want to wait in line or to dine in, you can pre-order online and come during pick up. I always do that since I get to skip the line and since I do not have a high level of patience. What about the foods? Adequate amount, reasonable price, nice presentation, look appealing, flavorful, full-filling. One of the reasons why I prefer Bento is because they provided good ""to-go"" foods that is suitable for lunch or dinner while presenting a classy look in term of platting. Majority of the time I would always order Sriracha Garlic bento box, with options of shrimp, tofu, or chicken as the main source protein, wok-stir fried with white onion, green bell peppers, and red bell peppers. (I usually get tofu or chicken since eating shrimp will only raise my LDL level to the roof even more. The box comes with a side portion of the house salad (sweet ginger dressing), white Jasmine rice, stir fry noodle, green beans, and fried wonton strip with condensed milk for desert. I preferred the box over the bowl option since the foods are kept separated. To me, the Sriracha Garlic is the best flavor out there, which is not too salty, not too spicy, not too sweet. The chicken or tofu go really well with the plain white white where the flavor balances each other out. Occasionally, I would get the Spicy Bulgogi (marinated sliced beef with lots of onions and scallion); Mongolian (red bell pepper, onion, scallion, mushroom, sweet hoisin sauce); Sesame Soy (red bell pepper, snow peas, zucchini, onion, sweet soy); and Korean (red bell pepper, onion, scallion, gochujang sauce). All of the one listed here are my to-go-to when I am tired of the Sriracha Garlic. My brother's persoanl favorite is the Mongolian, but not really mine since ti has mushroom. I have never tried their Pineapple Thai Fried Rice but I will next time since a lot of my friends has high praises. If you do not feel like eating rice box or rice box, then get yourself some rice rolls (SUSHI)! Dynamite, Spicy Salmon, Salmon Volcano. They are not necessary the best sushi in Orlando but it is good enough, especially when one is hangry. Overall, all my experience and visit here are great. Nothing to complain about. I enjoy the food and the people, where both are good and friendly, and that is enough for me. I do not have expectations or standard when it comes to a restaurant joint as such."
1/12/2017,4,"Bento's has always impressed me with their overall consistency in terms of quality and preparation. Whether it's in Gainesville or Orlando, you know you're going to get a decent meal at a fair price. My go to dish at Bento's is the Spicy Cream Shrimp Rice Bowl. Batons of fried tempura shrimp tossed in a delightfully spicy and creamy sauce goes perfectly with the rice and string beans that come with your meal. You would think that being so heavily coated in sauce, the fried tempura shrimp would become soggy and unappealing. However that is the furthest from the truth. The shrimp manages to maintain the wonderfully crunchy exterior while protecting the well cooked shrimp on the inside. That crunch and sauce make for the perfect combination of taste and texture in my opinion.One thing about this location, heavy traffic means it is always a fight for an optimal parking spot. So be prepared for some quick hustling if you want a prime spot. But overall, good spot for a quick and delicious meal."
3/15/2019,4,"I've been coming to Bento for a couple of years now because it's close to our office and a good lunch option. Bento is one of those restaurants I never think of going to but leave satisfied every time I go. I went today for lunch and was so happy with my food and service, I finally decided to leave a review.We sat at the bar (good thing, the line to order was out the door) and were greeted by the sweetest server. She was obviously swamped with all of the to-go orders and people ordering but she greeted us with a smile and served us waters and took down any appetizer orders. I was starving today so I ordered the spring rolls for the first time here. We also ordered the crab wontons which were delicious as usual. After a couple of minutes with our menu, our server took our order quickly and I settled on the shrimp tempura rice bowl. She took the time to explain that it's only shrimp tempura with a little bit of green beans over a bed of brown rice, to make sure I wasn't expecting anything else! Everyone else ordered either rice or noodle bowls and a poke bowl. My spring rolls came out quickly and were warm, crispy, and tasty. The sweet sauce on the side they were paired with was delicious - tangy and just the right amount of sweet. My rice bowl also came out fairly quickly and was just as the server described. There was a good amount of shrimp tempura pieces and a small serving of green beans on the side. The green beans were absolutely delicious and I quickly ate those up. I saved my spring rolls sauce and ate the shrimp tempura with that. The shrimp were big and juicy and fried perfectly in the tempura flakes!One of the girls I was with ordered a rice bowl and found some hair on the top as soon as it was set down. The runner who brought the food could not be more apologetic and had the kitchen make her a new dish. He comped her meal, too!Overall, today was the best experience I've had at Bento and writing about it makes my mouth water for more shrimp tempura. I think if this was the only dish I'd ever gotten there this would easily be a 5 star review!"
2/15/2021,1,Placed a order for 2  bowls I was asked for the sauce told them white sauce they said 3 will be fine I said yes so I wait for the order to ready and when they hand it to me there was 2 sauce I told the lady was supposed to get 3 sauce she says u get 2 only and any extra will be .50 cents which is not a big deal even though I was told will get 3 sauce any way I pull out a dollar to pay for the sauce and she is like we don't accept cash sorry so now I am not going to charge my cc for .50 cents so I just leave and not to mention she was the manager of the place seeing I wanted to pay for the sauce I would expect her to just give it to me but no And not the mention when I ordered the food I tipped them too which I regret
5/5/2016,4,"Even tho this place is called Bentos, their bentos are alright. Not bad for the price but their veggies comes with it are alright. The noodles are alright, if you want noodles, just the noodle dish instead. There are good days that the veggies good. Their Katsu with or without curry, all the curries, spicy cream, ramen, and their sushi don are good. I tried some of their sushi rolls but can't remember which ones now but they are good. Curries have a nice strong flavor and they give Katsu is good portion to you. Spicy cream is actually interesting sauce that I don't know any other places does this sauce. If you want their rice or noodles, get spicy cream! Their beef udon soup is actually not that bad. I couldn't stop drinking the soup! Their now ramen got better. They have changed it since few months ago. But they only do limited ramens per day so ask if they still have it.Their Korean beef and hibachi dishes are alright. I would have just gone to Korean restaurant for Korean beef. Their boba is alright. They do do boba stamps. Get 8 stamps, get 9th one free. They have poke bowl now for $9.50! Not bad price! I haven't try it but my friend said its alright. I'll give it a try anyways next time!"
1/18/2019,4,"I've been going to Bento at its original location in Gainesville since I first started college. Upon moving to Orlando, I was really happy to see there was a Bento that reminded me of home at UF. This location is very clean and modern. Staff is friendly and service is quick. There are tons of options to choose from the menu. The classic favorite is spicy cream chicken (now called Pao Pao Chicken?). I've also had their udon noodle bowl with katsu chicken and orange chicken. Their bento boxes are also great as well. All of their food honestly does the job when it comes to craving Asian food that isn't your average Chinese takeout. My favorite that I usually always get here is their tuna salmon don. The bowl itself is delicious and they always have A+ presentation when it comes to their bowls. I love how they cut up their cream cheese into little cubes so it's easier to eat rather than one big clump! LOL. Overall, Bento is so conveniently across from UCF campus and the food is great. Will continue to come back and try new dishes."
8/1/2018,2,"Food was okay. I was in the mood for a poke bowl so decided to come here before work. The thing that ticked me off about this place was that we had to wait 10 minutes to put in our order. There was only one person taking orders at the register while 6 employees were in the back conversing. They could be talking about work for all i know, but to customers, that looks bad. They need to work on making sure customers are taken care of in a timely manner. If people wait too long in line to get their food, they will be more inclined to leave to get something somewhere else. Another thing that was annoying was that the employee charged me an extra sushi bowl. They took 5 minutes to void the transaction, but gave me no voided receipt. They also charged me again for the same order, so there's a possibility I got charged double. With all the trouble, they did nothing to help, but say sorry. Hopefully you don't experience this if you come here like I did."
4/13/2018,3,"Look, the place is good. Good food, good portion good price. I wouldn't qualify this place as amazing though. I've been here a few times and every time I get annoyed at 2 things.Please clean the tables more often. Every table is usually messy or hasn't been bussed when I'm at this location.If there is more than one order per table, maybe time the food so that they arrive at a similar time, not a drastic 10-15 minute difference. Otherwise I quite like the place."
2/22/2021,1,This would be a 4 star if the lady didn't yell at us for asking for a TOGO bowl. Not only did we get yelled at for the bowl but then later on we preceded to ask for a bag and we got yelled at again. I think her name was Karen. Not sure what the issue was for asking for these things but rest of the people were nice.
1/12/2021,1,Been coming here for 2 years might be the last time.  Terrible service terrible food took forever to het our food one bowl came out finally the rice was ice cold then finally the bento box comes out wrong chicken then what I ordered the veggies were mush pic attached & there might have been 3-4 pieces of chicken. Staff had no concern at all
1/24/2020,2,"Normally an okay meal/sushi at this bentos. Couple times they've changed things. They no longer make the rice free rolls which we got every time. But last night we went with our family and ordered the same thing we always get. Large bowl, $14, and there's an add protein portion at the bottom for $3 dollars. But the women at the counter argued with me we couldn't add extra chicken to our bowl with that. That it was only for a certain item. Yet on the menu it doesn't say anything about that. It simply says add protein $3.  Which we have done before. She got rude with me and my family and wouldn't get a manager when I asked to speak to someone. Last but not least my daughter (3 years old) got her food last. And not just a minute or two, like 15 minutes after everyone else. Which I'm sure you can see a problem with that."
11/22/2020,3,Not so much a fan. The meat is very chewy. The sauces taste store bought. Definitely closer to a frozen dish than anything fresh.
2/10/2019,5,"This place is phenomenal. I love the staff, the atmosphere, the food is fresh. Parking is somewhat limited, but there's a parking garage right next to the establishment that is free. The place is clean and the food is affordable. Highly recommend for your quick stop for sushi."
7/17/2020,2,In today's ever changing COVID world some businesses have been successful in adapting and overcoming challenges. Bento has failed in doing so. Ordered our food ahead and still waiting. Clearly they need to work on how food is ordered and picked up. We will not return.
7/13/2019,3,"Been going to the Dr Phillips location for years. This was my second visit to this location, across from UCF. Unfortunately, much the same as my first visit, my food and experience lacked. Poké bowlwas tuna and eel - the eel was overcooked. Again. And my bowl came six minutes after the cooked bowl in my party. (After four other tables, that ordered AFTER us, received their orders.) The cooked bowl had shrimp and was too salty. Part of her rice was hard, either burned or old. Props to the girl at the register- she was patient with my mother's questions and very helpful & knowledgeable with recommendations."
7/15/2020,5,Coral the manager was so sweet and accommodating. There was an issue with my order and she was so quick to make things right and rectify the situation. Great customer service from her!
5/9/2020,4,"Great menu for sushi, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese food. Quick order at the counter and sit down style restaurant. More of a casual college stylepplace."
4/21/2019,4,"Get the Spicy Cream Chicken with White Rice. It's to die for. (they renamed it ""Pao Pao chicken"" but that just sounds weird to me)Service is typically good though it can take a while sometimes. Since it's located right across the street from UCF in a busy Plaza, lines are consistently long. Which is why you should ALWAYS ORDER AT THE BAR! There's a register there too and they can take your order there instead and skip the line. The food itself is pretty good but it's your run-of-the-mill Asian/fusion restaurant. Nothing particularly special but it's consistently good!"
9/2/2018,4,"Great Boba Teas and friendly service, just not prompt whenever we visit. We're looking forward to dining-in soon as it has been awhile.The entrees as well as appetizers are scrumptious, just not always hot due to sitting on counter for lengthy time prior to being served."
9/2/2017,4,"Bento Cafe is a restaurant chain that offers a variety of Asian dishes. You'll find flavors from Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Japan... you can have a new experience during every meal. This was not my first time eating at a Bento cafe but it was my first time at this particular location. The restaurant was clean, staff were nice, and food was good. We ordered a variety of dishes for the people in my party and we all tried each others to see what was good. A person I dine with is obsessed with Asian food so I find myself eating these flavors often even though it's one of my least favorites, but the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup will be my go-to menu item here. I do wish it had more bok choy in it - gotta get your veggies! but it was perfectly spiced (if not a little salty), nourishing, carb comforting with long udon noodles, and surprisingly hardy with huge chunks of beef that you barely had to chew. If I have to eat Asian, Bento cafe would be one of the restaurants I wouldn't mind repeating. Tip: You can request brown rice instead of white rice if desired."
6/23/2017,5,"One of my favorite places to get Asian food in the Orlando area. Service is quick, location is great (right by UCF) campus, and the food is fantastic. Bento offers a variety of Asian inspired food items on their menu, everything from Korean pork, sushi, Sweet and sour chicken, as well as a wide range of different boba teas. I've tried almost every item on the menu and now I just usually get the sweet and sour chicken bento box or udon noodle bowl. Food is always served quick with the exception of maybe Friday and Saturday nights where this place is jammed packed. It makes a great lunch spot during the day though, I would go often back in the day when I was close by. Overall, Bento can be highly recommended whether you have a craving for Asian inspired dishes or just want to pick up some boba tea. Can't go wrong with stopping here. They also have a small selection of beers should you be in the mood."
9/30/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is a dream come true. Quick service, delicious food, and the nicest staff ever! I've been to all three locations in Orlando and all of them have surpass my expectations over and over. The UCF location is quick service. Once you have decided what you want from one of the menus conveniently located at the front, you proceed to the register to order where you'll be given a number for your meal. After paying, you can proceed to sit wherever you want and the food will be brought out to you in a very timely manner! Location is very spacious, there's plenty of seating inside and outside which is nice for individuals that want to sit outside and enjoy the weather. But let's talk about the most important topic of all which is the FOOD. Bento offers a variety of food ranging from bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, sushi, and boba tea. There's something for everyone. No foodie gets left behind! The food is always hot, good portions, and comes out relatively fast when you take into consideration how much traffic goes through here. My favorite would have to the Spicy Cream chicken or shrimp rice bowl, curry katsu, kawaii roll, build - a - poke, chirashi and so much more. You def can't miss out on the variety of sauces from the ponzu, spicy mayo, white sauce, and eel sauce either. Everything is extremely filling. Go to Bento! You won't be disappointed."
5/23/2015,3,"Bento's has opened their second location at this location near by UCF a few months ago and it is pretty busy all the time. The interior is contemporary looking with a small bar to the left, sushi bar in the back, and the rest of the open restaurant. There is open seating but some of the tables are awkwardly situated that doesn't allow a good flow because they are so close to each other. The entrance funnels customer to order at the station before they are given a number to be placed at the table. I am pretty sure the menu is the same as the location in downtown. I don't know why but i always order dishes that resemble Chinese food (way of life...habit.. i don't know?!)  and it's alrriiiight. I've gotten a cantonese pork chop bento box and also szechuan chicken over rice. They were both mediocre and tasted lack seasoning. The cantonese pork chop is especially dry when cooked the way they served (seared). If they do make the sauces they might need to tweak it a bit besides having everything taste like soy sauce.Surprisingly, their katsu dishes (fried pork chop) is much better and tender. I would also say their curry sauces are pretty good too whether it is home made or coming from a jar. It's a great place for lunch because it's quick for the most part. There was an instance where the meal took literally 25 minutes to make where all the other people around was getting their food. However, the manager graciously offered a 10 dollar GC to covered the meal."
2/10/2017,3,"I came here after a friend invited me to dinner. When you first come in you order at the register, they give you a number, you sit, and they bring you the food. The selection of food is good and I opted for the build you own bowl and a miso soup.   My bowl consisted of shrimp, tuna, salmon, seaweed, shitakii mushrooms, avocado, and carrots. It was okay, nothing out of this world. I really likedl the mushrooms but I think they had sugar in them. One of my concerns was that I had a few questions and the girl taking my order just kept saying I don't know which I don't blame her. If their staff is not trained on the menu then they wouldn't know the answers. Also, I didn't expect her to leave her register and ask, especially since there was a line.    Also, the amount of avocado was next to nothing and that was dissapointing. I really liked the broth in the miso soup, probably the best thing I ate there. The atmosphere is loud, very social. So if your coming here for some nice quiet time with conversation then go somewhere else. I didn't really mind it. Overall, an okay place but forgettable compare to other Japanese restaurants."
9/27/2018,4,"Every time I come in, I am so impressed by the quick service, large portions and high quality of the food!I'll admit that the rice bowls can be a bit plain, as they only come with rice, string beans and whatever protein you choose. While the proteins are covered in a sauce already, my boyfriend ended up stealing some of the seaweed salad from MY bowl as he felt that his chicken katsu was lacking more flavor. But he still enjoyed his meal- the cuts were so juicy and tender, while the bread crumbs were crisp! I also really enjoyed my meal. The Surf'n'Turf with chicken teriyaki and extra white sauce is soo filling and yummy! In the end, I'm so happy this restaurant is located so near to the UCF campus and Special shoutout to Norynne who greeted us cheerfully in the line :)"
5/18/2019,5,"Been here a few times and I like this location as it's easy to find free parking (there's a parking garage at the back). The line to get your order is fast and you can look at the menu while waiting to decide what to get. They have a wide variety of food from bento boxes, sushi, and poke bowl. They have some nice craft beers as well. It's self service (think fast food but healthier and delicious options) and you can ask for water cup when ordering. I got the mini poke bowl and 4 piece rainbow sushi this time as I wasn't too hungry. But the portion of mini salmon poke bowl was larger than I expected and in a good portion as well. Ingredients were fresh and yummy. If you don't like poke bowl or sushi, I would suggest the Japanese curry in bowl or get the teriyaki Bento (salmon or chicken) box is really delicious and I usually have to take it to go as the portions are generous. They also have to go boxes ready so it's really self help and fast to eat and go if you are in a hurry. If not, stay around the nice booth or just chill at the sport bars craft beer section for a good chat with friends or date night! Worth a visit to this branch!"
6/7/2017,5,"When me and a friend said we were in the mood for sushi rolls another one of our friend, swore by this place and boy, she did not disappoint!Walking in, I noticed that this place was very much a hot spot! Lines were to the door but it moved pretty fast. My friend who is known for her taste buds, did all the ordering, so we grab some singha beers and a table. Moments later, plates of delicious rolls and rolls were placed in front of us! We dived in immediately. We started off with the lava roll. It was the bomb dot com. We ended up ordering 2 more rounds of it. After that we got Mexican rolls, fried pork dumplings and a curry chicken katsu. All which were really good but I was hooked on those lava rolls.This location is really clean and the staff are all friendly. Service was great, food was on point and we had a wonderful time."
4/27/2020,5,Decided to try and ordered delivery. Wow! This place has the most DELICIOUS asian food I have ever had. This restaurant is not your typical Chinese take out. It's an amazingly good restaurant with great food. I really enjoyed General Tso chicken and my significant other tried the Teriyaki chicken and was amazed how good it was. I will order from here if I ever have a taste for Asian food.
4/13/2020,1,"My roommate ordered a Poke Bowl for pickup through Door Dash, and then proceeded to go to the store after 10 minutes, she was told ""it's not ready yet"". Waited an hour in the car only to go inside and be told they didn't get it yet. Then her boyfriend get in and suddenly they had the order and it ""had been ready for a while"""
2/17/2017,4,"I really dig Bento and while the one downtown is closer to my home, this one is perfect when I'm at work at UCF. As a vegan I appreciate the tofu option for their rice bowls and I'm starting to be more adventurous as far as trying different dishes.I normally get the broccoli rice bowl with tofu, so I mixed it up with the sweet and sour bowl with tofu this time and I'm glad I did! It's really good and a great balance of flavors. The tofu is done well, it's not soggy like you can sometimes get at places that don't drain the tofu properly.Their spring role appetizer sometimes is iffy on flavor and how thoroughly cooked it is, and I know they've mixed up my order once in the past. But I will continue to come back often to try the different bowls because it's worth it and so convenient. They even let you call ahead!"
5/9/2019,3,"This place actually does have decent food. The service is pretty okay as far as that goes. I come here for a quick bite, generally takes about 10-15 min for all food to come out (no longer than that). A lot of college kids come in and they have a bar and its got great specials (always packed on those nights i dont drink but assume its good). I have tried the chicken teriyaki and i have tried the beef bolgolgi. I think next time i may try the sushi though. Also, the Miso is excellent."
8/15/2020,1,Lost my online order! Had to wait 20+ minutes for them to cook it when I got there to pick it up! First and last time I'll be coming here!
1/21/2019,4,"If you're a college student on a budget but crave quality food, Bento will be your go-to. When I was a student at UCF I came here at least once a week. I like getting the build your own poke bowls and their other dishes as well. Today, I got their Szechuan Beef Noodle soup for this cold weather, and man did it really hit the spot. Must try! But it is a lil spicy so beware!"
7/29/2018,5,"I love BENTO Cafe !!!! I always go for the Pai Thai with Chicken It has a little kick in it that makes you want more and more. And the noodles are rice noodles and always comes out delicious  My girlfriend got a lo mien With steak  it was amazing as well. We been to bentos many times and multiple reason. But usually whenever we want something Chinese related we head over there.And the sushi are amazing. I would recommend for people that aren't sushi fans like myself. To order the ""Crunch"" (Raw) or ""Hot Lava""(Cooked) both great with Spicy Mayo on the side!!! Yummy !!!"
1/7/2019,4,"I have to say I really like Bento. Fresh food and consistent quality. The biggest drawback is the noise level and huge lines during lunch time.Bento is one of the options near my work and I do love their make your own poke bowl. Not like Hawaiian poke but close enough and it gets me that fix of yummy raw fish. For the poke bowls you choose your base white rice, brown rice or mixed greens (half brown rice and half mixed greens is my fave). Then choose one, two or three proteins (from raw to cooked options). Choose up to 4 veggies, two toppings and two sauces. They also offer sushi, bento boxes and so much more. Definitely on of the better chain restaurant options around East Orlando/UCF area."
2/1/2019,5,"Stopped by for dinner after we heard they were a title sponsor for a fundraising dance.  The concept is clean and well laid out.  We got in line to order and it moved fast.  We had sushi, a garlic chicken rice bowl, ramen special, bubble tea, beer, and some edamame .  When we ordered and we were told it would be about 15 mins for our food.  It was even faster and everything was fresh.  The food came out individually and was great.  Everyone loved their meal and the quick service and friendly staff."
9/9/2017,5,"Bento is my go-to whenever I'm in the UCF area and need a quick bite! I've also been to their downtown location multiple times. It's a fast casual spot so the service is quick. This location is right across from the McDonald's. Order at the front, they give you a number to be seated anywhere you want, and they'll bring the food to you. The location is large and I've never had an issue finding seating.They offer a variety of menu items such as sushi, noodle and rice bowls, bento boxes, and bubble tea. There is something for everyone to choose from. The food is great for the portion, price, and convenience (most items are under $12). Food is always consistent every time I go. My favorite items are their Spicy Cream chicken bento box and their Chirashi bowl. Very filling!"
5/25/2019,4,"Came here today with my siblings and cousins for a quick lunch. It's a casual place and lucky for us, the line was short. The service was also quick. I tried the Japanese Curry katsu. It comes with a complimentary sauce so I had the white sauce. The curry sauce tasted delightful, but the white sauce was amazing. The katsu was crispy and moist. Also had the Pao Pao spicy cream with chicken and tofu. The portions were huge and the spicy cream sauce was delicious! Prices were reasonable and food was great!"
3/10/2019,4,Tried Bento Box tonight with my sister. She really likes it so I was excited to try it. We walked in and I was pleasantly surprised with the simple decor and aroma. I had several questions about the menu. The young lady taking our orders answered them for me. I think this place is ok. If I want sushi... I'll go to my favorite place. But it wasn't bad and the atmosphere was friendly.
8/28/2017,5,"My gf is a teacher so the first couple of weeks are usually pretty stressful for her. That usually means a lot of errands after work and a lot of eating out which I fully take advantage of. Today she asked me to drive to the UCF Amazon store so I decided to take advantage and head to bento for dinner. I've been to the one downtown multiple times and it's one of my favorite Asian spots. I have never been to this location before.For starters the UCF location is counter service. You order at the register, they give you a number and bring the food to the table. Drinks are self serve. As an appetizer we ordered the Mexican roll (8 pieces). It came very quick and was delivered with some eel sauce. It was delicious. You can tell the tempura shrimp was just made because as soon as the roll hits your mouth you can taste the warm delicious flavor of tempura. Add a little eel sauce and BAM, you get the perfect roll. As an entree I ordered the spicy cream chicken after reading so many good things online. Boy o Boy was it the right choice. The chicken was delicious and had the perfect amount of sweet and spice. It was almost like a spicy mayo type of sauce that was cooked on the kitchen. Everyone who reads my reviews knows I love crispy chicken and sweet and spicy flavors so this plate was my perfect combination. The bento box came with rice, noodles, dessert, and a salad. Next time I might order the rice bowl since the amount you get in the bento mix isn't very filings. My gf ordered the Siracha garlic chicken bento box. This was also very tasty as well. It was a lot spicier than my chicken and seemed to be a lot heavier in flavors. Overall I loved bento at UCF. I wish it was more like he sit down service downtown but everything was great. Any time I am in the mood for Asian I will pick this place."
7/26/2019,5,Came in here for some lunch. I ordered the combo which had some really good rolls. Especially loved the Cali roll.
7/10/2019,5,"We had this last night for take out as we wanted something more healthy and substantial than we had been eating while on vacation; my husband had the udon vegetable stir fry bowl with tofu, and I had the sesame bento box with tofu.  Both were excellent, fresh, and the sauces were very flavorful. The tofu was prepared well, all of the entrees looked appetizing, and the vegetables were not over cooked. Only one minor issue--the lettuce in the salads was a little wilted. We will definitely be returning for either an eat-in or a take-out again."
7/21/2016,4,"I've been to Bento Cafe several times since it's conveniently near my workplace in the UCF area. When ordering at the counter, make sure you grab either the sushi menu or hot food menu (they call it Asian Kitchen) - or double fist it if you're hungry! I've tried various items over multiple visits. Food has met my expectations and has been consistently good. My favorites are the Florida roll and Szechuan chicken rice bowl. Recently I noticed they've limited orders to one sauce. I typically only need one sauce anyway, so it doesn't bother me, but it makes me wonder if there were hungry college students consuming large quantities of sauces at some point... Either way, four stars for this Asian restaurant chain!"
2/16/2021,1,"The lamest excuse for Asian food ever. The sauces are sugary or taste like water. I'd rather get less food and have it be higher quality. Bento is quite frankly, shitty and disappointing every time I go."
4/9/2019,5,"Classic! @eatatbento is where it's at! Right by #ucf ! It's just around $11 for 3 different types of sushi rolls, salad and yummy broccoli! Oh! Don't forget to ask for the white sauce!  It's definitely worth the bite!"
2/28/2020,1,Ordered food & 5 mins later it arrived to table COLD. Girl at front register misinformed us of the options and menu. Waitress snatched plate without asking if we were done.  ONE & DONE!!! NEVER WILL I EAT HERE AGAIN! I don't advise you too either. I also ordered the sushi that was so sticky that it stuck hard to the plate! I'd advise going to a real bento or Asian spot instead of here with struggling students n cooks.
9/14/2016,3,"There is only one thing about Bento Cafe that I cannot stand -- they do not deliver all food ordered by the same table at the same time. Every single time we came here, the first person at our table will finish his/her meal before the next person is served.We ordered a deluxe Sushi, a Special Sushi roll, a shrimp Pad Thai and a Chicken Wok with Noodles. Everything was great, except for the Chicken Wok is a bit heavy on the salt. Convenient for UCF parents and sons to meet."
1/12/2017,4,"This Bentos like many of the other locations around Florida serves up your favorite Asian American dishes including the likes of spicy cream, curry katsu, sweet and sour etc.I tend to order the Chicken curry katsu or the spicy cream chicken, both are pretty much staples for me every time I go to Bentos. The food here comes out pretty quick, faster than the Gainesville locations in my opinion. I also feel like they do a better job with the chicken curry Katsu here, its just more crisp and better tasting. I've also had the crab/cheese rangoons which arnt bad. You also have the option of going noodle, rice, or bentos box with each entree. Personally I like going rice bowl cause I find it more filling and just a better complement to the entrees I order.This location is a decent size with plenty of seating, theres also a parking garage if you cant find any parking space in the lot. Overall, Bentos is a place I'll crave every now and then. I never seem to get tired of it. It's a solid choice for Asian American and close to UCF campus as well."
10/9/2019,5,"I really love this Bento's and I'm glad that my coworkers introduced me to them. I haven't been able to find any great Yaki Udon here in Orlando, and Bento's sure can cook Yaki Udon very well. They first time I tried it, I did Teriyaki chicken Yaki Udon with their white sauce, and the second time, I ordered the garlic shrimp Yaki Udon. I also tried their Passionfruit green tea and, though quite pricey, it was very smooth and not too sweet. Both times I ordered to go and I did not have to wait too long to get my food and I received great customer service, even though they were very busy both times I came. Will definitely come back"
6/4/2018,5,"When I come to Bento I always have to get the Spicy Cream Tofu Udon Noodle Bowl, it is literally my guilty pleasure even though it is so simple it is bursting with flavor. I wish I had a picture to show the beauty but every time I get it I always eat it so quickly before I remember to take a picture. You can get it on a rice bowl or noodle bowl (udon, mini udon, or lo mein) and then choose either chicken or tofu. For greens there will be green beans on the side. Bento isn't the most authentic Asian food, but for being so close to UCF and for college students to get a quick Asian cuisine, this will do. They have a variety of flavors you can choose from to be on a rice bowl or noodle bowl as well as bento boxes. Pro tip: If you check in with Facebook they will give you $1 off"
9/16/2018,5,Fast food Asian fusion cafe.  A lot of tasty options here to choose from depending on what you are in the mood for.  The service is pretty quick and out of all the times I have been I have yet to been disappointed with anything I have gotten.  Great option for Asian food on the go just Incase for whenever ur tired of normal Chinese takeout.
3/29/2020,1,I waited probably 30 minutes for ONE order of Katsu Curry. I grew mildly impatient watching the employees lolly gag and take their time with everything and everyone. In the midst of the Corona Virus there were more than 20 people in the lobby with no protective equipment or strategy implemented. NEVER going back to this disappointing restaurant
1/30/2018,4,"Was craving the spicy cream chicken, so came to this location since it was closer than the one downtown.  At this one, you stand in line, order, then are given a number to place on your table until your food is brought out.  We went around 3:30 pm on a Sunday not expecting it to be too busy, but it was.  The line didn't take too long and we were able to find a booth by the drink machine.  There was a bit of a wait before we got our food, about 20 mins, but when we got it, we did enjoy it.  My boyfriend and I both got the spicy cream chicken bento box that comes with ginger salad, string beans, noddles, white rice, and the amazing spicy cream chicken.  It is so good you will definitely want to come back for more!"
3/19/2018,5,"Love the concept, the food and wish there was one in Tampa. Food is fresh and done just right. Very tasty Bento Box with spicy cream over tofu. It was fried, but very delicious. Will definitely be back"
3/10/2019,3,"Large variety of Rolls and combinations, and you can get a decent meal for about 10$. However if you're not a fan of loud places you might not like how busy it is. That being said, its well lit and decently fast service."
1/4/2020,5,"I just want to state that my boyfriend is one of the pickiest eaters ever and this place manage to have him try new things ever time we go here! We come here almost every week now because everything is so good! I wish i could give this place more than just a 5 stars. I really enjoy every meal that was given to us so far and I especially love the sushi bento box! It is absolutely one of my favorites! Here is a recent picture of one of our orders we got! Beside the yummy food, all the employees are very nice! There was this one time I was waiting for my food with my boyfriend and he got it before me. However, one of the employee came up to us every 5 minutes and apologized for the wait. At the end it was worth the wait! I would recommend anyone who lives near UCF or pass by UCF to give this place a try!"
6/1/2019,1,"Aside from the fact that I just saw a cockroach on the table behind me while looking for soy sauce because my table didn't have any, the food was late and almost forgotten by the staff. I probably won't be visiting this location again because of the cockroach incident. The manager sat at the table where I saw it with another employee and tried to catch it. When it crawled into the booth behind them, they acted like they didn't even see it. That was definitely not expected and is especially disturbing because this place serves raw fish! I loved the food before this but I don't think I can come back. The manager said they do their best but here's a question...if a cockroach was on a table with plenty of patrons around, what is lurking in the kitchen?"
1/11/2016,4,"My coworkers commonly come to this place for lunch since it is so close to us. I wouldn't say that it's a super authentic type of Asian cuisine place but this is still a great place to come and get some quick and delicious Asian inspired entrees. I really love coming here on Tuesday as they have tea Tuesday where you can buy one boba tea and get another for free! Their boba teas are actually very good and have some cool combinations, I'd recommend trying the royal if you're a coffee lover.As far as food goes, they do have tasty choices, but nothing I'd rave over that I'd go out of the way to get. However it is affordable and decent for what you are getting. I'd suggest a bento box as this gives you a variety of things to sample. Service can be okay, since it's open seating for lunch servers just come by and look for your table number that you received when you ordered at the front of the restaurant. Sometimes that can get confused during the busy times of the day and can take longer than expected, but no more than 10 minutes. Overall I do enjoy Bentos and really do enjoy the atmosphere and vibe they give off for a quick style service restaurant."
1/31/2020,4,Super yummy food and fast service. Just a little small and over crowded during lunch time
9/1/2015,3,"A cool, hip, minimal atmosphere, I kind of felt like I was rolling into a Japanese night club. This isn't a bad thing, just not what I was expecting at 11am on a Tuesday.The service was pretty snail-paced, considering how few people were in the house. We waited to order for nearly 10 minutes and waited a bit longer to receive our food. Everyone seemed rather kind, just not the most efficient.The old band-aid sitting on the first table we sat down at kind of threw me off... No no no, Bento. That is yuck! The second table was nice and band-aid free.Most people probably wouldn't think twice about this, but as a wheelchair user, the space was rather cramped and not super easy to navigate (even with these sweet driving skills). Too many tables, too many ropes, too close together. I ordered a Mango Milk Tea, which was a bit too sweet for my taste buds. Next time, I'll try the regular milk tea which is supposed to be less sweet.My friend ordered a tofu bento box and enjoyed parts of it. Nothing life-changing, but it was a decent lunch."
9/1/2015,3,"I wasn't expecting an authentic and true Japanese cultural experience by any means, but I do believe Bento could do better at what they are trying to accomplish. The environment is somewhat imaginative in a minimalist/modern way, which I enjoyed. The service was iffy. As soon as I walked in, I was in a line of 3 people waiting to order my food.  It took about 8 minutes until it was my turn to order. Way too long of a wait for a near empty restaurant at 11am. Once I chose a table with my friend, our boba teas and food took about 10 minutes to get to us. Again, not bad, but the place was empty. Once my bento box arrived, the employee asked if I needed a fork or chopsticks.  An obvious question to which she left to bring me an eating utensil 3-4 minutes later. The bento box was so-so. I got the red curry with vegetables and tofu. The tofu was tough and rubbery, but the vegetables and the curry sauce made up for that. The ginger salad wasn't too impressive. It contained a few pieces of lettuce drowned in dressing.  The rest of the food in the bento box was okay. Nothing impressive enough to mention. My jasmine milk boba tea  was really good. Not too sweet and very refreshing.  I'm looking forward to trying the sushi next time I visit. Maybe that can redeem my feelings on this establishment."
3/15/2018,4,"I really like bento. This is one of the most decent Asian food places I've been to. Of course it's not authentic, but it's really good food nonetheless. I usually order the teriyaki chicken. It's nicely charred, which pleasantly surprised me. The veggies are also super good, although I wish I got to pick when I get green beans vs broccoli. I've also had their sushi. I'd say the sushi box is a pretty good deal! You get a decent amount of sushi (I think you get to pick a roll and you get a California roll). It's pretty good! Service isn't super quick here, but for the quality of food I still go. They're always really helpful and courteous."
8/1/2015,4,"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened (I keep forgetting about it! Lol) and I finally made it! We got a few rolls and shared them so we could try little bit of everything. -The garlic edamame was good. -Miso soup was ok; a little salty and the seaweed was very chewy. -Crunch roll was good, but not tempura batter. It was deep fried or something. Not crazy about the batter or whatever they used but the roll was good. -Spicy tuna roll wasn't great. The only that made it spicy was spicy mayo. That is my staple roll and it bums be out when it's not done right. -I did he make your own Kuwaii roll and it would have been good if they used a different kind of lettuce. It was big and thick and overpowered everything else. You couldn't taste anything but lettuce, which is a bummer. -Red dragon roll was great and will definitely get it again!The best thing on the menu is that you can design your own roll!! How awesome is that!?I didn't even look at their non-sushi menu but everything that came out looked good. I look forward to going back!"
9/18/2015,4,"I have friends who aren't particularly crazy about Bento....but it's close to home, always a great spot for takeout after work, and it tastes pretty good too! This spot is a winner in my heart! Their tuna tataki salad is my usual, but their rainbow roll is pretty delicious too!"
5/30/2018,5,"I've visited this location many times. The food and service has always been great. I love their tofu. I got lo main noodle with vegetable stir fry. It was good as always. I will definitely be coming back! P.S. if you check in on Facebook, they give $1 off."
9/12/2015,3,"My cousin and her roommates recommended this place. My aunt really likes this place as well. My first impression wasnt too well since when my bento box arrived. The steak was completely burnt! ! I didnt realize this until my 2nd or 3rd piece. My throat felt weird and sore. When i flipped the meat over, it was absolutely charred black. I called over a server and showed her. They told me it wasn't suppose to be that grilled up. I waited for a new one but by the time i arrived everyone finished eating. I did enjoy my groupies watching me eat. #PaparazziMode The salad and green beans were my favorite. My mom ordered a Rice Bowl with curry katsu beef. It was very tasty. I prefer that than the beef teriyaki bento box i had. I was able to try the chicken teriyaki bento box that was better than the beef bento but not as good as the curry beef.Overall:Bad experience with the burnt steak but the curry beef made up for it. Three stars only this time. Next time i will try the sushi and hopefully higher ratings!"
1/10/2017,5,"Bento is one of my all time favorite places to eat. The staff is always pleasant when we stop in for lunch, and the atmosphere is typical of what you'd expect from a restaurant close to a busy university.For fellow wheelchair users, getting through the front line can be a bit tricky, and some tables are difficult to get to if it's busy, but the restaurant as a whole is fairly wheelchair friendly. It can get busy during the typical lunch rush hours, but things usually move quickly.I'm a creature of habit and usually wind up ordering the same thing every time: Spicy Cream Chicken Noodle Bowl with a Creamsaver milk tea. I've also tried the Katsu Chicken Bento Box in the past and it was delicious. If you're ever in the area I recommend stopping by!"
9/16/2015,4,"The Bento Cafe brand, If you are not familiar with them, is a small chain of seven restaurants with more on the way, that offers a creative mixture of Asian inspired dishes from wok stir-fry to fire-grilled items to sushi using the finest Asian spices and the freshest ingredients all at great prices.The concept at Bento is to bring unique and authentic Asian food in a fast and efficient manner. Everything on the menu is cooked to order and prepared in minutes and served up in an atmosphere that is fun, friendly and stylish. The word ""Bento"" means boxed-meal in Japanese, and they have a wide selection of traditional boxed meals, but the menu includes a wide variety of sushi rolls, sashimi, nigiri and chirashi bowls as well as soups, udon noodles, rice bowls and noodle bowls. They also offer Boba Tea, a popular Asian beverage that is consisted of milk tea and chewy tapioca pearls.Every store is designed differently which makes visiting each Bento Cafe an experience. Each store will be either dominated by the warm red dragon colors or the cool blue dragon colors. Each Bento has a sushi station, but the UCF location has seats at the sushi bar, so you can watch the chefs prepare your rolls live and in person. Speaking of sushi, the Jade roll with marinated spicy tuna, eel, avocado, krab delite, masago, scallions and eel sauce tasted just as good as it looked. For my entree, I chose the the Sesame Wok Stir Fry bowl. This dish comes with your choice of chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu and red bell peppers, snow peas, onions, baby corn in a sesame soy sauce. I really enjoyed the flavors, and the portion was more than I could eat. Now, I really did enjoy my entree selection, but it would be dishonest of me not to tell you that I was really jealous of my wife's Bento Box. She opted for the Sriracha Garlic Chicken in a bento box. You can get chicken, shrimp or tofu grilled or fried with red bell peppers and onions with a sweet and spicy Sriracha sauce for dipping. Bento boxes come with your choice of steamed rice or lo mein, ginger salad, and string beans and a dessert"
9/28/2020,4,I really enjoyed my meal! Asian food is always best served when it's hot so I suggest eating in the restaurant if you're comfortable with that!
4/24/2019,5,"I've been eating at Bento for about 10 years now, starting with one of their locations in Jacksonville. The menu offers a ton of different options and even has a large selection for vegetarians. My go-to meal is the spicy cream chicken Bento box (I think they changed the name of it). It includes all you could ask for, in small portions, for a perfect meal. I can't comment on the sushi because I've never tried it from a Bento location."
5/22/2017,3,I had really been in the mood for Bento's!  I usually visit the location in Dr. Phillips.  This location was different as right when you entered you placed your order and they bring it to your table.  Which threw me off for a minute.  Once we sat down our food came out before the appetizer of egg rolls and I had to ask for them several times.  The food was okay.  It just needed little more umph to be up to the Dr. Phillips location standards but it was okay for filling my mood for Bento's!
11/26/2019,2,"Subpar food, chicken was charred to a crisp, I get $6 bowls on Tuesday is a deal but quality is suffering. I also found a piece of plastic in my food. Got a combo, no green tea which I usually get as my favorite. Although I saved a ton of money, my experience feels like a two star experience."
6/23/2017,4,"I came here with a few friends on a Friday for lunch. As packed as it was during the noon lunch rush, the line and patrons moved pretty swiftly so we had our food within 10 minutes or so of walking in. The prices are good and the combinations of food can be overwhelming. I went with the chicken curry katsu with the udon noodles. It wasn't quite as spicy as advertised but the udon noodles made it a pretty filling entree. The fried chicken it was served with wasn't anything to write home about so I doubt I'd get that combo again. I got the pork spring rolls too which were a nice side, but they came out a little cold in the middle. I'd probably come back again, just not during the lunch hour."
11/13/2019,3,"Inconsistent portion sizes(seen in pic 1 seaweed salad). A lot of ginger, little ginger, no ginger. Customer service is below mediocre. The food was good 6.2/10"
7/13/2019,1,"Just had their volcano roll and was highly disappointed. It tastes very cheap, which is upsetting since it's an expensive roll. They use imitation crab and whatever sauce that's on top tastes like it's heavy on the mayo. Won't be returning"
9/2/2020,2,This perfect word to describe the food here is literally mediocre. Not bad but would never pay for it again
6/18/2019,5,"We love coming here for a quick bite to eat. The food and service is always great! Even when the line is long, it moves quickly. The food comes out as it's prepared, but the wait in between entrees isn't long. Some of my favorite items are the Pao Pao and Special Mexican. Also one of the staff, Ivy, is always so nice and professional! She always checks in on how the food came out and if we ever need anything else."
8/20/2018,3,"Updating this review,  I was contact by the manager  and all is well.  He promptly reached out to me and corrected the problem."
8/15/2019,1,Well to start I tried the Pineapple Sweet + Sour noodle bowl with chicken and veggies for the first time a few days ago and it tasted good and had no problems. But now ordering from them again today it sent me to the bathroom twice so most likely will not be ordering from them again and is why I've given them one star and would not recommend anyone eat there. The Green Teas are nice though.
8/14/2018,5,I LOOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!Their food is delicious. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. There are many options to choose from. They have some of the best sushi and give you good portions for what you pay. Everyone here is so nice. I always come here at least once a month.
8/31/2015,4,"It was good. It felt like a modernized thai/sushi place, like a Burger 21 for thai & sushi.I got the red curry bento box with beef, and it is everything you need in a meal. It comes with rice, noodle, some green beans (I'm not sure), ginger salad, and this little fried things with some kind of frosted glaze on them. So you get everything; appetizer, meal, sides, and dessert. And with a fountain drink, it all came to just under $13, you are going to be hard pressed to find a full meal for that.I need to head back here and try some sushi."
9/18/2019,3,"Was very excited to try Bento for the first time. I was anticipating the great experience I heard from my friends so when I showed up in person I had high expectations. We waited quite a long time for two bowls and a roll of sushi and it was very hot in there like the air-conditioner must've broken. We got home with our to go food to find that one of the bowls has human hair lodged into the food. I spent a considerable amount of money on this meal and I'm very disappointed with the outcome of my experience. I tried to call in the phone and I got hung up on because the phone doesn't even allow a human interaction to occur. If you want hairy food and no human contact the Bento Asian kitchen on Strategy Boulevard is your place. Sushi was good though.*** update ***Since I live in close proximity to Bento I decided to try it again. I had to call twice to get someone on the line, and the man was nice. However, after I came to get my pickup order after the allotted time I was given, the woman at the bar didn't even acknowledge me for the first five minutes. She immediately made me pay and I had waiter 20 minutes over my waiting time. This is absolutely ridiculous. They also told me I would be rewarded with a ""gift card"" for my last troubles here and never even followed through. Bad business"
1/9/2019,4,"Bento is good. I wouldn't say it's great though. The food is good, I enjoy the atmosphere, and the service is okay. I would definitely eat here again, I wouldn't get the bento box though. It sounds great because it comes with a lot of everything, but everything they give is mediocre in taste. Get the actual dishes like the rice/ noodle Bowls. The flavors are way better!"
4/11/2015,5,"I think it's a great place for a fast lunch/dinner. You have many options of entree in Bento, Bowl or Noodle bowl style. They also have sushi and boba milk tea. The price is fair. I think for the quality of food you get the price is pretty good. They bring the food to your table. I've tried Japanese-style curry pork katsu, teriyaki chicken and Sichuan chicken. I always order them in bentobox (because I want vegetable as the side) with a boba milk tea. Delicious!"
3/24/2015,4,"I think the biggest disappointment about this location is the fact that it's not called Bento Gold D: I heard rumors that the UCF location was going to be Bento Gold and I was like yooo that's so awesome! But it's just Bento Red though. -tears-But anyway, I was happy with my food. I've been to the other locations in Orlando and Gainesville, but this one is probably my favorite. I typically order the Chicken Curry Katsu rice bowl, and what I really liked is that the piece of chicken was huge! It was definitely a good portion and felt like the price was reasonable. The service was good too, the food came out a lot faster than I expected even though it was a bit busy.My friend got a Korean Chicken noodle bowl which was just okay in my opinion, I'd stick to the Curry Katsu. Also, I was a bit disappointed with their boba. I ordered the Jasmine Milk Tea and the boba was definitely undercooked. It was way too hard in the center and took forever to chew. The tea itself tasted almost powdery too.Overall, I'm happy there is a Bento right next to the UCF campus and will probably be back soon [:"
4/12/2019,3,"I was very disappointed with this place. A lot of people from school say this place is great but I had an ""eh"" experience. From the start there was a guy taking orders then a girl came up to him and said ""I don't really feel like doing anything so I'll take orders"" and they switched. She was now taking orders. I went to order and when I was mid sentence she turned around and added to a conversation and then turned back to be and said ""now what was that again?"". The food was ok just really salty (as to be expected with Asian food). We went to sit down and the gentleman (same from earlier) took dirty dishes off the table but did not come back to wipe the table off. I asked another girl to have someone wipe it off and she never came back, I ended up wiping it off myself.(which is not a big deal but it was still annoying on top o the less than thrilling experience we were already having)"
5/29/2017,4,"I love Bento cafe. I eat here at least once a week, usually for takeout. The food is usually fresh, the service is cordial, and everything is delicious. My only complaint is when I try to call to place an order ahead.  On more than one occasion, I have been placed on hold for over ten minutes waiting to place the order. Sometimes I have to hang up and call again, and then hang up and call again. By the time I get a hold of someone, I'm already down the street from the restaurant, which defeats the purpose of calling ahead. Once you get past this trivial issue, I highly recommend bento for some delicious Asian cuisine. They have a dual-sided menu to cater to everyone's needs. The blue side is the sushi menu- rolls, bowls, and other raw (okay not all raw) delicacies. My recommendations on this cool side of the pillow are the Chirashi bowl and the Mt. Fuji roll. I'm sure there is something fried in the Fuji roll which makes my taste buds sing Hallelujah. The Chirashi bowl is a sticky rice bowl with different sashimi and veggies- my ""healthy"" alternative. Filling, delicious, and makes me feel so accomplished when I can haul rice in my mouth my chopsticks.The red side are ""hot foods""- rice or noodle bowls, or a bento box. They have a varied amount of flavor options and cooking methods for your choice of meat (chicken, shrimp, pork, tofu, veggie). My absolute favorites are the red curry shrimp brown rice bowl and the Asian Cajun chicken mini-udon bowl. The red curry is milky and deliciously ! And don't get me started on the noodles- I have to fight myself every time I walk by bento not to order them. I eat them so often, I am basically a mini udon noodle. Their service in restaurant is great, friendly staff, good food. Perfect place to bring your date so you can figure out if their food taste sucks, because if they hate everything on this menu, then there is something wrong with them."
8/15/2020,1,Good food but absolutely horrendous service. After a 45 minutes wait and watching two parties who ordered after us we were ignored by the staff when asking about our order. The staffs attitude will keep me from ever coming back despite the food. Would give .zero stars if possible.
2/12/2019,1,"I feel like the food has really changed lately and it was for the worse. Am I the only one noticing the portion of food in the rice bowls has gotten smaller? Also, it seems that they're using this super chewy beef that is impossible to chew unless you have knives for teeth. It's super unappetizing and its even worse when it comes out cold.  Yet, the prices rose but the quality of food has gone down. I won't be eating there again, period."
3/22/2018,3,I haven't been here for a while and it has fallen off..... When did Mongolian chicken get mushrooms added to the recipe?It took a while for my sweet and sour bowl to get to the table (is not bad) - my hubby was practically done with his food before mine got to me.I'm disappointed and don't think I'll be back
5/15/2015,4,"Bento is a counter service type of restaurant, where you order and then bring a number back to your table.  I stopped in for some noodles, and ended up choosing the Udon noodles for lunch along with a side of steamed dumplings.The noodles were a decent portion but I would have like just a little bit more for the price. Both the dumplings and the noodles were flavorful and well-prepared, the restaurant itself is clean, and the staff seemed friendly based on my limited interaction with them.First impression was overall a good one, so I'll be back to try some other stuff."
6/22/2017,3,"Family outing for lunch and one of my cousins chose Bento. We all either got rice bowl or noodle bowls. The menu is fantastic and the food is good! But there is only one problem I have, it's dirty. First, our table was sticky and disgusting so someone had to come wipe it down, most of our silverware had dried up food on them, and the to-go boxes had some type of black dust in them (good thing we looked before entering our leftovers). The beverage station was also incredibly sticky and had this weird smell surrounding it, there was flies in the trash and it was basically just a mess with all types of drinks spilled across the counter. Again, the food was great and the menu is wonderful but I don't know about the cleanliness of this establishment."
6/26/2020,5,"I always love eating here, the variety is incredible! Also their new online ordering platform makes takeout a breeze!"
6/24/2019,3,"I ordered a to go order, it was a bitter sweet experience. I loved their boba. Unfortunately our bento boxes were cold, and our lo mein tasted like cold pasta salad."
6/20/2019,5,Sasha and Nerenid have been the best bartenders I've experienced in a long time. They were super attentive and paid a lot of attention to us at the bar. They took our orders quickly and was super conscious we didn't distract them so we could get our orders quickly as they were so easy to talk to. Definitely will be returning just because of their attentiveness and great service!
4/11/2019,3,"Bento has such a variety of foods to choose from! The food is delicious, and it's very convenient being close to UCF. However, I've been there about four times, and three out of the four my order came out wrong. I received sushi when I ordered a bowl, or my bowl had the wrong meat and sides in it. But other then that, a very nice place for lunch or dinner with friends!"
6/12/2019,5,"My sister and I came into bentos thinking we were going to have a casual lunch until we met TOMMY, he was so helpful and it really helps that he has a contagious smile as well! He is great and fun and we will definitely continue our business here because of the awesome experience."
8/29/2018,1,"Got bento to go last night, price for a bowl with fried rice and mongolian beef was pretty crazy expensive for what it was, ($14+tax) but I decided to splurge because I really wanted the fried rice vs. white. The rice change was $5 added to the $9 for the standard bowl. What a colossal waste of money. It did not taste good, the meat has a very odd, fakey texture, and I woke up with horrible food poisoning and have been sick all day. Definitely never going back. :-( Doctor also said he has heard of quite a few people getting sick here before. Avoid!"
7/31/2016,4,"They have good rice bowls and noodle dishes. The sushi is okay. The place itself is spacious and offers a variety of seating options. If you want a fast asian dining experience, Bento is the way to go."
3/10/2017,5,"Been coming here fairly regularly for their poké bowls. You order at the counter, get a number and sit and wait. Service is always pretty fast even when it's super busy! I love the amount of food you can get in the bowl, two meats for $10, can't beat it!"
2/5/2019,5,"This place is good, always seems to be busy with a friendly staff. Went for the bold your own poke bowl with crab and shrimp.....oh so yummy. Sauce comes on the side choice of two and a good selection of ingredients. I'm visiting from southern Cali and wish we had one there?"
6/16/2016,1,"The food was great, but towards the end of my meal I found METAL in my chicken! When I told the manager she said it happens all of the time because of the scrubbers they use on their woks. Obviously if this happens more than once there is an issue that should be resolved. This piece of metal was very sharp and I could've easily cut my mouth. She was nice about it, but basically told me that there was nothing that could be done. If this was a one time thing it would be ok but there is no excuse to use the same scrubbers if it happens ""all of the time."" It makes me wonder if they are just waiting for someone to slice their cheek open before they change their wok scrubbers. I uploaded pictures in the pictures section."
6/30/2019,3,"Food is ok; nothing special. It's Americanized Asian fusion of sorts with decent and fresh ingredients. However, service happens to be rather slow. The line to order at the register is almost always out the door so if you do order, I recommend doing so at the bar or calling in beforehand.The most recent time I ordered take out here, I waited nearly 45 minutes before my poke order was completed. Now I am no expert of restauranteering, but 45 minutes is quite a time for food that does not need much cooking as it is served raw; especially when other orders that were made after mine were delivered earlier."
8/12/2016,3,"Terrible sushi - regular white rice used, not sushi rice (was not treated with vinegar, salt and sugar). Typical buffet quality - which is fine for a buffet, but not for when you are paying by the roll. Decent price considering the quality, but there are alternatives nearby.The bowl (yellow chicken curry with udon) was generous in size and decent quality.Probably not worth going here for the sushi."
2/11/2016,3,"Not bad. I'd go to Bento Cafe again because we got carryout and it looks like this is a place I'd probably enjoy more eating in. The sushi was nothing too special and it actually reminded me of sushi I've gotten at a grocery store (Wegman's). It just wasn't as fresh as I would prefer. However, I was in a rush and scarfed it down kind of fast because I was starving. As I said, I'd like to go back, sit down, get a cocktail and take time to look over the menu to try a few different rolls. It was nice to get $1 off when my DD checked in on Facebook."
11/19/2016,4,"This has become somewhat of a regular spot for lunch when I'm in the area for work. It's always fast and good, which makes it perfect for a quick lunch spot.There's nothing overly exceptionally great about the food, and it's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's consistently very good.I usually go with a Bento box and split a roll with the friend I go with. We both always leave full and happy. Can't ask for much more."
2/15/2020,5,Love love loveeee this place. Pao Pao Chicken rice bowl is always my go to. The only thing I would have to say is... PLEASE START USING APPLE PAY!!!!
8/14/2018,5,"Bento Cafe.. where do I begin?! I first tried this place in Gainesville about 8 years ago and I fell in love with them because of their famous dish, spicy cream chicken. Lightly battered chicken tossed with a spicy cream sauce is so addicting! I usually get that dish whenever I would visit Gainesville from WPB and each time was consistent. Now that they expanded to Orlando with three locations, my addition to them has grown! Their sushi is pretty good as well and I like how in some rolls you can get it for half portion. I've never had a bad meal here and I will continue to go here frequency!"
4/7/2018,4,"I love Bento! You can easily customize your food by choosing a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box. I love the bento box because you get a little bit of everything  you get lo mein, rice, salad, your main entree, string beans and a fried wonton dessert. It's plenty of food for less than $10!  I haven't tried their sushi or sushi boxes but I plan to the next time I'm there."
3/29/2020,1,The wait at this place is absolutely absurd. I waited over thirty minutes for one order to feed one person. When I asked on the progress of my meal I was greeted with hostility and impatience. I watched employees laugh and take their time as if there wasn't over twenty people waiting for their food in the midst of the corona virus. Absolute nightmare
3/28/2019,5,"Came to Florida on a work trip for 10 days... and I are here 5 times! Tried multiple dishes and each one was delicious. The sushi rolls aren't bad (I'm a bit of a sushi snob), but I highly recommend the bowls! Also, the spicy mayo is addictive!"
9/20/2016,5,"Great for lunch! Rice, noodle or bento box options, pair it with a main. Sushi looks decent."
10/19/2015,3,"Service is super friendly and nice, ordered over the phone and pick up was easy peasy. I've dined at Bento's DT area and DP areas before, both serve good affordable food. UCF's Bentos might be using different ratios to make their sauces, because the Japanese stir fry noodles I ordered were super duper bland. I am usually pretty sensitive to salt, so I found this super surprising! It's all chill though, I just went home and reboiled it with some seasoned dashistock and ate the udon noodles that way. Will give it a second try someday, but please double check your sauce ratios(?)"
4/15/2018,4,"Great discovery while visiting Orlando. Located not too far from UCF. This place is very trendy, great music and overall ambiance. The girl at the register, the runner and the manager were very polite. The manager handled a little situation (hair) we ran into with our food with care and respect. The Bento Box was well sized and tasteful. The Boba drink was good. Great selection of boba drinks on the menu. Overall certainly a place I'd go again and have a great time enjoying their food and drinks."
2/5/2020,5,Love this place! The food is always good and staff are friendly. Very good sushi made to order. The rice bowls are amazing. The prices are very reasonable and not overly expensive for the sushi. Will definitely be back.
1/16/2016,1,"Terrible Service, Mediocre Food. We went in and ordered the promo meal that was on their social network because the meal promised a free select appetizer to go with. Upon ordering the manager tells us the only options are edamame or miso soup, so we changed our orders.The food arrives at the table, the sushi.. BlahThe bento boxes came shortly after and my dates food was incorrect. After flagging down 3 people I finally got a manger to the table that said that she heard things went wrong but knew they were in the kitchen making the food fresh. If two people order together, why do people think letting both plates sit on the table and get cold while waiting for the new plate is acceptable? Why would I eat and my date is there disappointed and hungry.Overall this place is subpar and the service is like all of the other restaurants in the UCF area. This place is laughable."
6/19/2017,5,"Too many good things to say about this place, stop reading reviews and give it a shot! P.S. It's fine if you don't know what you want and want to browse the menu, but DO NOT GET IN LINE UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO ORDER. Thanks. :)"
1/27/2019,1,"So, here are all my reasons why I will never return and would not ever recommend this place. 1. The miso soup was not hot, and flavorless even with a bunch of salt and pepper added. 2. Crab Wontons were soaked with grease from the fryer, also flavorless - served with a disgusting sweet chili sauce. 3. All our sushi's rice was warm - which made the rolls warm. 4. We ordered the sushi's with no fish eggs, one of the four we ordered was served with fish eggs on top of it and it took 25 mins to get it remake(had it was packaged to go because they were now closed)5. The service was not the best, felt like an inconvenience to be there. No napkins anywhere to be found. 6. All the tables were dirty.7. Way over priced for what they offer - spent $48 and went to McDonald's next door and bought two $2.25 double cheese burgers."
4/26/2016,4,"The fire alarm went off during the middle of the meal and no one even flinches. I did hear a staff groan ""Not again!"" but I still enjoyed my meal. A waitress helped us move our plates to the patio seating area since it was slightly quieter than being inside. While munching on my protein bowl salad with shitake mushrooms, seared tuna, asparagus,  and cucumbers we watched the fire department arrive and the people who lived in the adjacent apartments slowly evacuate. My neo tokyo sushi roll is was like a spring roll and their sauce seemed a lot spicier than the Sand Lake location."
7/23/2018,5,"I've never had a bad experience with their food, service, or boba teas. Shout out to all Bento Cafe's out there. Keep up the good work :)"
7/5/2015,3,"I went here recently with my wife and a few friends who were visiting for a late lunch. The restaurant is very hip with lounge music playing and plenty of TVs showing various sporting events. In addition to this, there is a sushi bar near the front and what looks like a full liquor bar near the side. This is also a mix between a quick service restaurant and the standard sit down restaurant. You place your order at the front, are given a number, and your food is brought to you. Given this set up, I can tell that if you came here on a busy night, you might be waiting for some time before you have your order takent.However, their are plenty of staff running around who are more than happy to grab you utensils or extra packets of sauce.The good: Being fairly new, this place is very clean and the staff is very attentive. Our orders were promptly taken and just a few minutes after we had filled our drink cups at the Coke freestyle machine and sat down, our food was delivered. The staff came by multiple times to ask us if we needed anything, which was nice. We tried a few of the different sauces they offered and were quite happy with the white sauce (who doesn't love the white sauce, right?)The bad: For the price I paid for my wife and I to have a basic lunch (she only had fried rice, I had teriyaki chicken over noodles, and we both had soft drinks), I was taken a bit aback. It was just over $21 for these few items. So when our food was delivered I was again disappointed that there was not much food and disappointed in the quality. My chicken teriyaki over noodles wasn't much better than if I had gone to Panda Express just down the road. I know... I know... I really wanted to like this place. I had been to the location downtown before but in all honesty, it wasn't a very memorable experience. After many of my friends had told me to try the one over by UCF, I figured ""why not?"" Overall, my experience was lacking and I would rate this place as average."
2/1/2016,4,Delicious food and sushi but I do not recommend the boba tea. It is pretty hard and the tea tastes pretty artificial.
3/25/2018,3,"I've been to the Bento Cafe in downtown Orlando and it is excellent; nice atmosphere, nicely decorated, and great food.However, this is Bento Cafe UCF...umph.  Definitely a college restaurant.  Looks just like a fast food chain inside and you wouldn't know it was the same as the Orlando Bentos.  While the food was good, the extra $2 up charge for over cooked tofu in my bento box was sad.  I didn't think you could over cook tofu until it was rubbery brown on the outside and the consistency of old French toast on the inside.  If you ""must"" have it, ask them to pay you the $2 for ordering."
5/31/2018,5,Best Asian food by ucf hands down! Definitely try the spicy cream chicken either in a bento box or noodle bowl. Can't wait to go back and try their sushi!
12/3/2019,5,Was super hungry and not sure what I wanted to eat. Christina at the counter as well as another male employee were super enthusiastic and helpful. Very happy with the quality of service I received.
4/1/2015,4,"This was my first time going to any Bento Cafe. I know there are locations downtown and in Gainesville, but I've never had the occasion to go. So, my perspective is a fresh one without comparison.The place is located in the New University Plaza, built over the graveyard remnants of Old University Plaza. I'd like to think that buried underneath the concrete are the memories of the past: Shattered glass from that one time Bobby got totally wasted at The Library and smashed a bottle of Miller Light over Patrick's head because he looked to be trying to steal his girlfriend Jennifer. And somewhere, there are Jennifer's old lost contact lenses, which she lost the night she accidentally kissed the wrong guy who then got assaulted by some random bro afterwards. Enter: Bento Cafe.The line was spilling out the door slightly, but it moved quickly. The place is a lot larger than it looks -- there is plenty of seating: small tables, larger tables, sushi bar, drink bar. The interior has bright, simple colors (primarily black and red) assembled together with a staggering symmetry. The place* looks* like a Bento Box. If intentional, kudos to the design team. If unintentional, that's funny. Aesthetics aside, it's all very shiny and new and trendy. Hopefully it stays that way, because it's all very pulled together and sleek at the moment. I ordered the Basil Chicken. I was going to get a Bento box, but they wouldn't let me sub in brown rice. I don't make a fuss about such things, even though I didn't quite understand why. I mean, it's a scoop of rice in a tray. Still intent on actually getting brown rice, I switched to a rice bowl, which does allow you to sub in brown rice for an extra $1. Fortunately, the bowl was satisfying. There was plenty of basil and it was quite flavorful. The portion size wasn't gigantic, but it's a solid lunch portion. If you are on a gainer diet, you should probably go for double meat or get some kind of sides. MINOR UPDATE: I have been informed by someone who works at Bento (more specifically someone I randomly met at a party who coincidentally had read my review, life is strange) that you can in fact sub in brown rice in the bento box. Whoever did my order just probably didn't know. It's a new location, so the employees are still learning the menu.I'll have to come back to check out the sushi and boba. I'm excited to have yet another lunch option in the UCF/Research Park area. Still, it's strange to see the locale transform so much. We thought in the future we'd have flying cars, but instead we eat bento boxes inside of a giant bento box. I'm glad we have our priorities straight."
5/29/2015,4,"Bento: fast and delicious Asian food in a casual environment. Right by UCF, this restaurant has a modern, clean interior with a sushi bar, Coca-Cola freestyle machine, and plenty of tables, along with a few booths. I've visited a few times, getting noodle bowls, bento boxes, and sushi, and I'd have to say that their sushi is average but their noodle bowls are delicious. Pad thai is my favorite dish, although not spicy, it's great with sriracha. Their food is very reasonably priced for the amount you get- not huge portions, but a good amount for lunch or dinner. The concept of Bento is great and the execution matches. I would highly recommend you try it."
1/12/2016,4,Surprisingly decent. I'm typically in favor of a hole in the wall type but in a new city I decided to try try something near. The food tastes somewhat bland but still good.
9/7/2019,4,"Food is good. I like the variety, and the preparation is pretty fresh. My complaint is that the music is too loud, but it is a college hang out and I'm older. Also the tables and chairs need to be cleaned more regularly, when the food is removed, someone should wipe the tables down. I've had to wipe down my own table a couple times."
5/18/2019,3,"Good food and a lot of workers but if you dine in prepare to wait a LONG time. No matter how long the line is there is always one cashier. The rest of the employees will look at the line but none will come help the poor lone cashier.  Even if the line is out the door...one cashier. Get your food to go and you can skip the line and  get your food from the bar. If not,  bring a book to read while you wait in line...or write a Yelp review. I started typing this at the end of the like with my back touching the door I am still not to the halfway point in the line. I type slow due to fat thumbitis."
1/27/2018,5,"I got the pineapple fried rice to go, which was more than enough food. I was craving fried rice & it was a great choice. I would definitely recommend this place for vegetarians. Dating a vegetarian; When you can go to the same restaurant & both find something you like, then it's a winner."
9/3/2018,5,I love Bento's! They have many locations and this one is definitely targeted more towards college students but the quality of food and service is consistent throughout all their locations - excellent!
3/24/2015,5,"Had the Mongolian tofu bento box, side of miso soup, and a boba drink with mango poppers. SO GOOOD!!! New favorite place. Loved the outside seating too."
9/28/2015,3,"Was in the area so stopped by for lunch. It was really busy. Heard it was good from a friend who went to the Bento Café in Gainesville. It was ok. I've had better. Had the jalapeno roll, miso soup and the spicy cream bento box. If you want a quick sushi spot, this place is ok. But, if you want really good sushi....um....lots of better places."
10/12/2017,4,I love bento! The crunch roll is my favorite and I love how affordable everything is without sacrificing quality. The only thing that kind of turns me off is that instant miso soup machine they have put behind the counter. I don't want to know my miso soup is instant! Turn off lol
4/11/2015,4,"Love All The Previous 1s Visited Here In Orlando Metro (Downtown & On Sand Lake) Area & They Just Did Me A Huge Favor By Opening A New 1 Near Work & Across From My Favorite Florida University (UCF!) Gotta Love It  & My Craving The Other Day For Sushi Was Large So No 2nd Thoughts On Where To Go Even When The Line Was Out The Door Was Well Worth It. The Sushi Combo Box Always The Way To Go When On The Run & Is A Great Value, Enjoyed It & Will Now Be Apart of Regular Lunch Rotation #AGoodThing"
4/1/2015,4,"Three and a half stars rounded up to four. It is awesome to see what Bento has become. I remember the old days stopping by Gainesville on my way up to Tallahassee just for Bento. Now the Bento Group is slowly taking over Florida. For what the concept is of Bento, I think it they will do great at this location as with all their other locations. The food is quick, tasty, and caters to all tastes and cravings. On our first visit my fiancee went with a garlic chicken udon bowl and I ordered a chirashi and lava roll. The ratio of noodles to meat and veggies seemed to be a bit off in her bowl. It was a ton of noodles. The garlic chicken was good though, it had that nice ""wok-burn"" taste to it. My chirashi was pretty standard and the lava roll was just okay. No saucer was brought out with my sushi so I had to find the take out sauce containers myself. Not too big of a deal, but just some small kinks they need to work out with a recent opening."
9/30/2019,1,poor excuse for sushi. the second time this place has let us down. all rolls were cold as if they were refridgerated for quick orders. i don't recommend this place at all.
7/10/2018,1,"This Bento Cafe has SERIOUS safety issues. A huge piece of scrap metal fell on me as i was getting my drink, and hit me on my torso and then to the ground. I was shocked when it happened, as were the other customers around me. I told the manager about it and he just brushed it off. All he said was he didn't know how it could have happened. I'm a nice person, but the next person this happens to should sue! Watch out for yourself when you're in there. They don't care about customers safety."
9/4/2015,2,"Co-worker recommended this place and so I gave it a shot last week. I am always excited to try a new sushi place, as its one of my top 3 foods.  This location is directly in front of the University, so expect lunch time to be a bit busy.  With that said, service was quick and friendly, kudos. What I have learned about sushi over the years is that it can come down to ""you get what you pay for"", as with many things in life.  I say this because the prices are very good, but the amount is deceiving.  The amount of fish and veggies in each roll is misleading by the size of the roll.  If you look closely, they use a lot of rice to give the appearance of a typical roll, but in fact, there is very little fish and veggie per roll.  Very disappointing.  The fish seemed fresh, however.I really wished I could give them 2.5 stars, but will settle for 2.  There are several other places not far from Bento that offer more, but I'll leave that up to you.I had high hopes but walked away disappointed."
3/31/2015,3,"Good, but not really worth the hype. I've been hearing about Bento for ages, but have never had the opportunity to drive out to one of their locations. Naturally, when I heard they were opening another location near UCF, I was super excited!! I visited Bento last night and was just not very impressed. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and added tofu. After ordering and sitting down, the girl brought my food but informed me ""the girl at the register had made a mistake and we can't add tofu to this bowl in the future, just so you know..."" although it gives the option on the bottom of the menu. The portions were big, but there was nothing amazing about my meal. The bowl consisted of noodles and chicken, with hardly any sauce and didn't even stir fried veggies or anything else in it. I personally think Pei Wei is much better for the money. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but  just don't know if I will be a frequent visitor of this place... sorry!"
1/20/2018,5,"Totally love Bento (we live in Davie, Fl and usually go to that one) - tried this location and wasn't disappointed! If you don't like the wait time call ahead. Fantastic staff! We will be back next time we visit UCF!"
5/14/2018,2,This use to be one of my favorite restaurants but when you sit at your table and watch your food get cold before they deliver it to you. That really sucks.  However the hot plum tea was good
11/11/2017,2,Service was not great. Sushi came out after we finished our meals. At least 4 people came by and asked what we were waiting for. No one returned to comment or apologize.
6/21/2019,3,"They offer a wide range of noodle and rice bowls and a smaller range of sushi.  Good, not great."
2/12/2017,3,"I would avoid this location if you. Your best bet is to stop in the sand lake or downtown area. The line was out the door on a Friday night. Restaurant was super loud, which is the norm at a college restaurant. Got the usual, chicken curry katsu with noodles. When the food arrived, they gave me lo mein noodles. Not sure where the mix up was but they were able to provide me a new dish with their regular noodles. Sushi took a bit but they warned us when we ordered. 3 stars due to the long lines, mixed up on food, as well as noise. Food is still a top 4."
5/20/2015,2,I waited 38 min to get my food! The staff are nice but there were only two of them taking care of the costumes! Same story every day during lunch time. Order online if you can
3/29/2015,3,"It was ok for what it was, for the money PeiWei is better. I did come at lunch time after they just recently open so I'll give them another shot at another time."
2/25/2018,5,Best quick serve sushi place. The poke bowls are amazing and the salmon sashimi is great. Personally not a big fan of the tuna here tho. The quick serve style is super convenient for someone who doesn't want to break the bank getting sushi.
5/15/2015,4,"When I first heard bento was opening near UCF I was so thrilled! I appreciate that this one is more quick service than actual sit down restaurant because students are always on the go. It also has a bar and I believe happy hour which is awesome. When we got there the line was out the door. I ordered a roll that had salmon, tuna and cream cheese in it. It was really fresh and they didn't skimp on the fish at all. I also ordered a hot and sour soup which was really good too! I like that they are such a mix of all the Asian foods. I will for sure be going back."
7/31/2015,4,Don't order the crunch roll.  You eat rolls to be healthy but they deep fry it with a little sweet season!  So very unhealthy then they cover it with eel sauce to top the sweetness.  :(. No thanks.  Only on FL!  LOL Fat sushi!!!  Then the slices are big!  A perfect sushi is a perfect one bite.  Anything bigger just distorts your face while chewing and not good at all.  Not getting sushi here again.  I should have read the menu better.  My bad.
1/8/2018,5,This is my favorite bento location. Near ucf and the service is fast. I usually get the Mongolian beef with rice. They have some unique sushi rolls that you can try if you're into sushi.
12/26/2017,2,"I feel like every time I come here, I'm waiting for thirty minutes, minimum for my food. Currently sitting here and it's been thirty five minutes, I've order two rolls to go and everyone else around me has gotten their food. I'm not sure what it is about this place but the only reason I keep coming back is because the downtown Bento is so fast and maybe this place will get the memo. Guess not."
6/18/2019,5,The bento boxes here are great! You get several different things in them which is fun and I've never gotten one I didn't like.
5/14/2015,2,"All style, no substance. And no ramen either.I got there excited to try their ramen only to find out that this location doesn't serve it, even though it's on the menu. In the mood for a noodle soup of some sort, I settled for the spicy pork udon.The pork was super thick and overcooked, the broth tasted like sriracha water, and the dish came with nothing else but bok choy. The bento box my girlfriend got came with stir-fried noodles AND rice... but no sushi. It was a disappointment to say the least. The General Tso was as boring as anything and in no way made up for the rest of the box.If anything I would recommend the one downtown over this one just for the ramen, but there are much better places for that (Noodles and Rice on Mills Ave), so unless you're looking for a cool looking place to have some mediocre Asian food, I'd skip this one."
4/12/2015,5,"I love this place, I wish it had opened up sooner. The food is delicious and the menu is huge, full of many different options. I love asian food but the takeout places around here, haven't been very good and I have only been eating at Pei Wei and Kyoto. I finally have another place to go to and I love how close it is to UCF. 5/5 stars, you must check this place out. PS They have great boba tea."
5/1/2017,3,I work in the same plaza and during the lunch the lines are always really long. They usually only have one girl working the register and that is why. They should be properly staffed to support the clientele I mean this is the UCF area. On top of the long lines then the wait is usually long too. The food is great but with the long lines and long wait that is why I give this 3 stars.
11/20/2017,2,"I usually eat at the restaurant but I was tired and decided to pick up my order. They said it would take about 15 minutes and I arrived right on time. My food was cold, my chicken was dry, and they forgot one of my items. I would only recommend eating at the restaurant to ensure fresh and hot food."
3/30/2017,1,I honestly expected more and was really disappointed. I came before lunch rush. There were 3 other tables already eating before I arrived. Took me 20-30 minutes for my 1 sushi roll with 3 sushi chefs working........Ordered matcha boba and matcha was out of stock. Understandable so I ordered almond instead. I received regular almond tea with no boba but they got it fixed. It wasn't worth what I paid for and I got a speciality roll. I can get bigger speciality rolls from Fujiyama's on Alafaya for cheaper that will actually fill me up. I won't be back and will save my money for elsewhere.
5/23/2016,1,"This place is busy, the food is pretty good actually. Very tasty ! The service on the other hand is awful. Waiting at the bar for service when there was only two people there is ridiculous . The young man behind the bar was more interested in catching up with an old buddy in which arrived after me, ate, and cashed out before I was even checked on once to make sure everything was ok.           I was very polite in returning an order I had simply because it was a cooked item that seemed a little to undercooked on one side. He was a smart ass and asked me if it was my first time eating sushi. No honey it's not, I prefer cooked items rather than raw. Simple as that. When I looked over at him and the chef talking, the bartender was joking around and the chef was shaking his head in disappointment in which they were both looking my way.          Working in the service industry for 16 years I should know a thing or two about customer service. The manager even said she wasn't a fan about the chef when I spoke to her about my experience . I would love to come back for the food but probably won't give the chef nor the bartenders a minute of my time. So I'll find a new place."
8/21/2016,2,"Pretty disappointed with this place, both service and quality of food. Meals came out before appetizers, sushi was 20 min behind other orders, so wasn't received till everyone else was done. Food quality was basic at best. At least it's relatively cheap, but the downtown Bento's is way better - will make the drive down to there from now on."
12/23/2017,2,Been coming here for awhile. I asked for the sauce on the side and they put it all over the chicken. No big deal as they offered to remake it for me. Only problem was they let the other part of my meal sit out until they finished cooking more chicken so everything else was cold when I got the meal back.
5/10/2017,2,"I've eaten here before with no issues; their food is good though the sushi is ordinary (to be fair, I haven't tried their signature rolls).  I thought today's meal (the cream chicken rice bowl) would be rated excellently until I reached my last bite of rice and found a damn hair.  Not sure if I'll be back..."
12/10/2017,5,"Bento is my favorite place to eat, lunch or dinner. They never fail me. This location specifically. Sand lake location is a little behind, cashiers have been rude every time I have been there and try to charge extra for things i have not purchased. I always tend to sit at the bar and dine in at the UCF location, food is always amazing. Servers/bartenders are all awesome. Obsessed with the sushi! Will never get sick of it, even though i eat here at least 2-3 times a week!"
4/19/2019,3,Prices went up. Then nearby business discount removed. It's cool. Just wont come as often now.
4/17/2017,5,"Very good!!!! Food is delicious and made fresh, doesn't make you feel bloated like most Asian foods do!! Happy and will be returning"
7/10/2017,5,"I. LOVE. BENTO. They have buy one get one boba tea every tuesday, so my boyfriend and I are here every week for that. About every two weeks, we go here for lunch or dinner and they have a HUGE menu selection. Every time my family comes to Orlando, this is where they want to eat. There's something for everyone here. P.S. try their boba tea and their edamame!"
11/7/2016,4,Quick and delicious like always! I ordered the bento box with spicy cream chicken and a miso soup. The bento box is a great combination of everything and the spicy cream chicken is just delicious!
4/30/2019,5,"This place is great! The food was delicious, and the staff was helpful. The manager, Seth, was really knowledgeable and helpful. I cannot recommend this place enough."
7/8/2017,5,"Best sushi in the area for the price! I am never disappointed in what I order. I love sushi, have been eating it for about 15 years, and this place is my favorite place to go get sushi. It's one of my favorite places to take people when they come to visit. I like spicy, but some of their spicy things are like lighting your mouth on fire!"
1/25/2019,5,I love this place. Sierra works the front counter and she's amazon. So nice. So kind. So pretty. So knowledgeable about different menu items. Encouraged us to get more food for better prices. What a queen. She was just so nice to us after a long hard day at work
7/8/2016,4,"I give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the boba isn't as chewy as it should be. (Sample your competitor, Chewy) but aside from that, their Taro milk tea tastes amazing and their sushi is great quality."
9/6/2016,3,Not great. If you want something similar to sushi and you're in a hurry (but not too big of a hurry) this is the place. It tastes like it's made by someone other than a genuine sushi chef. Meh.
3/4/2017,1,"-Slow service, waited over 25 min just to get 2 rolls.-The interior is so loud when busy that you cannot hear your own thoughts.-Doesn't have a Cafe vibe, more of a loud dine-in experience.-No Wi-fi, very poor AT&T signal inside.-The sushi was okay I guess. Nothing special.-The prices are good.-The menu had good variety.I wouldn't recommend this place unless you like loud spaces and plan on spending about an hour, ordering a lot of food. Not the place to ride solo."
1/31/2019,5,"My usual orders are the make your own poke bowl, and recently I've been getting the pad thai. Both are delicious. Not the most budget friendly option in town but the environment is always extremely clean, the cashiers are kind and always offer complimentary water cups, and overall it's a good choice for good Asian cuisine."
1/16/2016,1,"Was mislead by there social media page about a deal they offered. After dealing with that for 10mins ended up ordering something else. The order taker placed the order wrong causing the food to be wrong. The sushi came out by it self, then my food, then hers. Nothing came together as it should have. Noodles were cold , taste was bland. Talked to 3 people before getting manager. The first 2 shrugged off the issue. Once my food was corrected hers was cold. Collected a refund and left. STAY AWAY or choose the McDonald's across the street."
7/9/2018,5,"Love their food. Their service is quick . Will go back again.had chicken bento box and shrimp pad Thai . They don't have enough napkins that s the only thing I have noticed which did not satisfy me, however when a waiter was asked about that she was helpful to provide us some paper napkins."
6/27/2018,1,This is the loudest place on the planet and they can't handle a lunch crowd.  15 minutes to order. waiting another 15 for my to go bag- still waiting.
1/26/2016,4,"I think the reason it is becoming so popular is because of its perfect location, right across from UCF. The service is very good, and the food is fast. I ordered a Pad Thai and remember thinking that it needed more flavor. I also ordered it extra spicy and didn't even get it medium. But I will just give it another try next time because I've gone to the one in Gainesville and the food is always surprisingly good! Also, if you check in on FB you get some sort of discount!"
11/1/2015,1,I was truly disappointed in this excuse for a cafe. I ordered the Curry Pork Katsu and the meat tasted and had the texture as if it had been frozen thawed and then frozen and thawed again. It was very rubbery. The staff had no idea of what was what. I highly recommend going somewhere else. Two thumbs down.
9/7/2018,3,"The customer service here is terrible. I went to this bento twice this week and both times were super busy, so I understand why servers would be in a bad mood. But the same person took my order both times and she doesn't even try to smile, she is obviously impatient, and is very rude. The first time I ignored her rudeness, since it was busy and I knew that I would be in a bad mood too. But the second time... if you're going to be in a bad mood every time it's busy, why don't you work somewhere that isn't as busy as Bento... Other than that, the food tastes great and the drinks are good."
9/5/2018,1,A little disappointed that it's 7:30pm the line is wrapped around the restaurant and there is only one person working the cash register. This is prime eating hours there needs to be more employees taking orders.
8/25/2018,5,"My friends and I basically go here every week. Food is amazing, i am never let down. The spring rolls are awesome"
1/11/2016,3,"Definitely amateur hour on service, but the sushi that we did eat is excellent.. The sushi was mostly tempura unfortunately, the place is for rich college students who's biggest problem is what tree to hug first makes it a little uncomfortable if you are in your early 30's."
8/10/2015,5,"I ordered pad Thai for takeout. They were super friendly on the phone, and when I got there 5 minutes later my food was already ready! Decently priced and tastes great! & the convenient location across from UCF is cherry on top of the cake!"
2/2/2016,5,"We got entree of sweet and sour shrimp, hot and sour soup and creamy spicy shrimp with white rice. Pretty delicious food. Quantity was good as well. A go to place for sushi as well. Though we didn't try sushi. Over all it's good."
7/15/2018,5,I have been obsessed from the start!!! Top two favorite things are the PAD THAI NOODLE BOWL & the MONGOLIAN. Bento's never disappoints! :)
9/25/2018,5,Delicious hot meal.  Clean restaurant and friendly service. I tried the new Pole Bowl and really enjoyed it! It was so attractive and tasty.  I would like to see more options for toppings in the future though. Their Be to box was so good! It had a lot of variety and was fun to eat and share. I am looking forward to coming back soon.
2/8/2016,5,"Amazing food! Sushi, entrees and Boba teas are all delicious. There are plenty of options to choose from and there's something for everyone to try. Tuesday's the teas are buy one get one free which is awesome. The staff is always friendly and very quick to bring your food out. I've never had any complaints! Would recommend to anyone looking for a great sushi/Japanese restaurant in the UCF area!"
6/10/2016,5,"I highly recommend trying any of the 9 Bento Cafe locations (7 current & 2 coming soon). The sushi is always fresh, there are plenty of non-sushi menu options, and everything is reasonable priced.Bento Cafe has long been one of my favorite places in Orlando to get my sushi fix. I've long been a customer at their Dr. Phillips location, recently visited their UCF area location for lunch. It is my experience that significant differences (between locations) in customer service, food quality, atmosphere, cleanliness, etc. can occur.This is NOT the case for Bento Cafe. Their UCF area location matches and (in some areas) exceeds their Dr. Phillips location. The service was incredibly friendly, helpful, and timely (despite the large crowds). The food was excellent per usual. I got a spicy tuna roll, cucumber roll, and tofu pad Thai noodle bowl. Both rolls (8 pieces each) were more than filling. The noodle bowl ended up going home with me for dinner. The 2 rolls and noodle bowl ended up costing around $20, which is incredibly reasonable."
1/20/2016,1,"I ordered a stir-fry dish and their most popular sushi roll, Gucci. It was awful. It didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go there nor would I recommend it to anyone.If you do choose to go avoid sitting in the back next to the fountain drink area. It smells like wet carpet"
8/19/2015,3,"I wouldn't go as far as saying the food here is awesome, but Bento Cafe does serve decent Asian Fusion cuisine. Despite being quite large and spacious, seating can be limited during the busiest lunch hours, so you might spend a few minutes hunting down a table. The food comes out quickly, and there's a lot to choose from. I've only had the bento boxes, which came with a lot of food for around $10."
5/4/2015,5,"I love this place! I highly recommend the Spicy Cream Chicken, it's excellent. The new UCF location is also very nice and definitely a lot nicer and faster than the other locations in Orlando."
8/28/2015,4,Came with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Got the General Tso chicken bowl and enjoyed the crispy chicken and dark sauce. (Usually redder from other places) only reason not full five stars is because the smaller pieces were more batter than chicken. (Still tasty though :/)
2/28/2018,3,"Very expensive for what you get, and it feels like you pay for normal side items like soup or salad. The boba tea mix selection is nice, and you can buy ramune but other than that not worth it."
8/2/2015,3,"Honestly this is a great place for quick sushi after class when you're too lazy to drive further out for better quality sushi. That's pretty much it. The sushi is definitely nothing great, but its not bad. I dislike the amount of eel sauce they feel the need to pour over most of the sushi rolls so I usually opt out on that. Overall its a great quick fix for cravings, but nothing else. I find it a bit overpriced for the amount of sushi you receive. If you really want your bang for your buck just don't be lazy like me and drive the extra distance.Their boba teas are good except the boba balls need work. Boba balls are supposed to be chewy and not hard. I can tell they haven't mastered their boba balls yet."
1/5/2017,1,"i usually love bento. i visit there once a week but today i went in for an early dinner and a roach crawled across my table. i got up and told one of the cashiers and all she said was ""sorry"" didn't get a manager or do anything about the bug that just ran across my table. not sure if i will ever go back. just went to bento for a second time to see if they could redeem themselves....NOPE there was a bug in my soy sauce."
4/17/2016,4,The asian cuisine here is pretty good. I eat here once every week or so. I'm just getting into sushi and I found there entrees to be pretty good. I definitely recommend giving there spicy creme rice bowl a try.
12/16/2015,5,Samantha was excellent we will definitely be back wonderful person and the food was to die for expecially for the price
8/2/2015,5,"The name says it all, you have to get a bento box when you come here. I always order the spicy cream chicken bento box and I will never get sick of it. The chicken has so much sauce in it and very flavorful. The green beans they give you is delicious. Then they give you white rice and lo mein noodles and they're the same as a regular chinese restaurant. I would recommend going here, its fast and a new look on chinese food"
11/15/2017,5,"I came to Bento for some sushi and sat at the bar. The sushi came out quick and was fantastic. The bartender, I think his name was Fasley, was attractive and charismatic and made sure our experience was perfect. He recommended sake drinks and they were great, I only wish he could have drank them with us. 10/10 returning again"
6/18/2015,5,I have never had sushi before today and it was an amazing experience. I am an extremely picky eater and I asked if I could have chicken tempura roll but just chicken and rice so the cashier asked the manager and he said yes that it could be wrapped in rice paper and the manager had heard that I'd never had sushi before. He asked if I wanted to try anything else and I said I was skeptical. As I'm waiting for my chicken tempura roll I received a shrimp tempura roll on the house just because he wanted me to try it. It was DELICIOUS! Incredible customer service and incredible food. Thank you Bento!
3/31/2015,5,"I go to the one in Downtown and Sand Lake all the time and tried this one out while I was in the area.  Awesome!!! I like the new additions/changes to their current dishes.  The appearance is great, roomy and has a fresh look! The staff is great and courteous as like the other locations.  Def. recommend the Spicy Creme!"
4/26/2017,1,I was really unimpressed with my food and who charges you a $1 for extra sides of Siracha? I mean mom and pop restaurants don't even do that . Not worth the price
4/21/2015,5,"When it's busy it can be frustrating waiting to order your meal, other then that this place is the bomb... Great sushi & stir fry... If you are into spicy go for the Cajun chicken stir-fry Bento Box... You wont be disappointed. Also portion sizes are perfect, I either leave stuffed or with a doggy bag. Awesome Place!!!"
7/27/2015,3,I was really excited to see that a Bento Cafe was opening up closer to where I live since I had been to the downtown location a few times and really enjoyed it. Good food and good atmosphere. It can get pretty busy and the few times I have gone the line was out the door but it moves along fast enough. I am pretty disappointed by how much they reduced their vegetarian options compared to the downtown location though.
10/14/2016,5,Always have a pleasant experience.. Food is always fresh and prepared correctly! Love the combo of both menus
4/3/2015,5,"I've been to the other Bento locations (Gainesville, Downtown, Sand Lake) and this another gem.  Yes, the line can appear long, but it moves very quickly.   I had lunch with 6 friends today and we had no complaints.  Service was great, especially considering they have only been open 2 weeks.   We all did different meals, and I got my tried and true - Spicy Tuna Don.  All delish!I'm so glad Bento is just around the corner!"
2/28/2017,2,The service is good but the food has gotten kinda bad honestly. You'd be better off finding a more authentic sushi place to eat at.
8/21/2016,3,"I ordered the udon noodle chicken bowl. Some chicken prices dried out, veggies fresh but overall dish wasn't inspired. When giving your order tell them you want mild, medium or hot as the Sriracha bottle was almost empty as it gave the dish some needed flavor. It's fast casual."
10/2/2015,3,"Ordered delivery through doorstep. The food I got wasn't bad, just bland. Not impressed. Also didn't get any soy sauce or utensils with my order which obviously sucks and made eating it difficult. I also got fried dumplings and was also disappointing, the flavor was ok but the the outside was unlike any asian dumpling I've ever had. It was thick and reminded me more of an empanada. Don't know if I'll try this place again."
4/27/2016,1,"So the service at this Bento is terrible. This isn't the first time I've had an issue with Bento UCF, but literally every time I go in, there's something. This time I was there to pick up an order, which should have been under 5 minutes because the restaurant was dead. But I waiting at the bar and I notice there's another woman waiting, and I no one is at the bar attending people. I notice this girl bagging food, immediately i know its her who's supposed to be taking care of the bar area, she looks towards the bar, and the phone rings (I'm assuming to call in an order) she takes the call. Whatever, so a good couple of minutes pass and me and this lady are glancing back and forth at each other. I finally walk up to the regular counter and ask if anyone can check out at the bar. Instead of helping this girl was like ""Yeah she'll be there in a minute""  So I walk back over to the bar and then the girl who was on the phone came back to the bar and then checks me out before the other woman, which throws me off even more. I was waiting there for like 10 minutes, who knows how long this lady was sitting there. But clearly terrible pick up service, which sucks because its close to UCF but the Downtown location is 100x better.On other occasions, I've called in and the phone rings for like 6+ minutes. One time I went in and I was trying to order spring rolls and this guy tried to tell me they only had egg rolls. He was going back and forth with me and then I had to point it out on the menu for his to put my order in.The food is good, the service is terrible"
5/26/2015,4,"Udon! All you need to know. Really fresh, nice option for ""fast"" sushi. Much needed in the area."
2/11/2016,1,"Ugh!  If I could leave zero starts I would.  Ordered a make your own bowl with tuna, salmon and steamed shrimp.  One bite of the Tuna - so gross.  I hate to be crass- but it was like a mouthful of snot- so completely slimy.  I have never in my life tasted such a vile piece of tuna.  That sorta' ended lunch.  I had to spi9t it out and go rinse my mouth out of the slime.  I found it interesting that a couple of ""attentive"" staff walked by and asked how it was going (in a fly-by sort of way- so no chance of actually mentioning what was wrong)- none seemed to notice the full bowl of food.  When a girl came to clear the table, I did mention my lunch was not so hot.  She replied, ""Oh- the make your own"" - like it was my fault for picking  bad combo or something.  I let her know it was not the ""flavors""- but the gnarly tuna.  ""Oh- I'll let them know in the kitchen.""    Thanks.  $12 dollars gone and no lunch- I drove elsewhere and grabbed lunch somewhere more consistent.  It's been a few hours and I'm starting to  feel a little nauseous-  pray for me."
12/21/2015,1,"This is actually my first review. I made an account specifically to leave this review. Normally when I see people slam restaurants on yelp, I think to myself, ""How do you care this much? Just don't go there."" In this instance, however, I feel like it's a health hazard if I don't, so here goes.Bento claims to have gluten-free options. This is a pretty big deal to me since I'm super allergic (diagnosed by a doctor) and it isn't always easy to find gluten-free options when eating out. Just describing my reaction to gluten would break the review guidelines, so just trust me when I say that it is both disgusting and painful. Unfortunately, while Bento technically has gluten-free options, big chunks of breading magically found their way into my food 5 times out of 7 visits (they kept saying it wouldn't happen again, and I guess I'm gullible so I kept trying). On one instance, I didn't just specify that I needed a gluten-free meal, but I told the cashier that last time I accidentally got breading in my food that made me very sick, and my meal STILL ended up with breading in it! At this point it almost seems like they're doing it on purpose.  I've never been offered any sort of compensation other than a replacement meal, which is wildly inconvenient since I'm usually in a hurry and I get take-out and don't discover the breading till I get home. The last time it happened, a lower manager told me that I should check my food before leaving the restaurant, which is clearly true. However, shouldn't the kitchen staff check the food before it goes out? She really was just trying to be helpful, but is not getting what I ordered really MY fault? Either way, the breading gets all mixed into the sauce, so often I don't find it until I crunch into a piece, and by then it's too late. There is clearly some sort of a problem in the kitchen that needs to be fixed. Keeping breading out of unbreaded food really should not be this complicated.The final time that it happened I was promised a call from upper management addressing the issue but it never came, so I assume they never addressed it.All in all, the one-star rating isn't because the food is bad. I like the food. I went there seven times for goodness sake! Even those toxic pieces of breading are delicious, they just make me really really sick. I just want to warn others with dietary restrictions that Bento will not take it seriously, no matter how much you beg. I know I've learned my lesson."
2/2/2016,2,Lunch rush line was 15 minutes.  Food took an extra long time to be delivered.  Both entrees arrived incorrectly. Which took even longer.  My least favorite Of the three restaurants in the area.
2/4/2016,1,"This is my second attempt to email the corporate office. On February 4, 2016, I placed a to go order at the Bento near UCF in Orlando. Per my recipe, I ordered a 4 pc Caliente roll and a lean mean from an April B. When the food arrived back to my office, I realized my order was wrong. We could not back it back to Bento due to work obligations; therefore, I decided to call. A young man that didn't give his name took my call and I explain to him that my to-go was incorrect. He asked if I wanted a ""store credit or something."" I said I expected something due to the error. He asked what my original order and told me he would talk to the manager after he had already placed me on hold to assist another customer. He left the phone and came back shortly after and asked had I received the 4 pc Caliente. I said I had. He then informed me that the Lean Mean had been discontinued, so the order for the lean green was placed instead. I asked why hadn't the young lady told me that; he said he didn't know because he didn't take my order and I wasn't his customer. He also said ""oh well, there's nothing we can do about it now."" After $15 at this establishment and another $10 at another establishment for more viable lunch, yes there is something that needs to be done about this. I visit this Bento weekly and we discontinue patronage until I receive some sort of refund for this mistake on April B and the entire staff at Bento for this error on them. Not informing a customer, that has an allergy to cucumber, that an option had been discontinued and replacing it with roll that was full of cucumber is unacceptable. It would have been a lawsuit had I even ate it because of my allergy. This behavior is unacceptable and your employees should be better informed about the menu options so that mistakes like these don't happen again."
6/29/2016,3,"Eh. That's all I have to say for this place. Speaking on behalf of my experience (first time) here, I have to admit, I had higher expectations for this place. When you first walk in, on your right are two menus, the kitchen menu and the sushi menu. I didn't even know that was there until some customers ahead of us had to reach over and grab it. Second, the menu was confusing. I think the TVs displaying of the food was a better glimpse of what they have to offer than reading the menu itself. Did I forget to mention they ran out of the kitchen menus? I had to grab one at the front and make my decision quick for the many people standing behind me, waiting, menu-less. Now the food was ok. It wasn't that good. I ordered the shrimp tempura noodle soup and my friend ordered the pork chop noodle soup. When it arrived, it was just plain old broth and udon noodles. There was barely any pork chop and the shrimp tempura was on the side. For such quality of a soup, it wasn't worth the $8 or $9 a bowl. I also ordered a milk tea but it tasted like syrup and milk. This place is alright. I guess I should've ordered the bento box... if the menu was actually legible. Wouldn't come back unless there were specials."
10/6/2022,5,"This food was delightful. I was not expecting it to be so good considering it's a fast food spot. I had their yellow curry and I was impressed! I like the variety of veggies ,the chicken was tender and the curry itself had great flavor."
12/19/2022,2,"We used to love coming here, we came nearly once a week because the food was so good. We always referred to it as "" a better Panda Express"".. however, around covid, they had a price increase, and they priced us out. Haven't been since. I miss it but I can't fathom paying their current prices. I would love some sort of special at least."
10/1/2022,5,Wow!. The hate is real for this place. I love how fast their takeout service is and I appreciate the ambience of the restaurant. It is located in a lovely mall and the decor and the design of the restaurant are both wonderful.
12/11/2021,5,"My daughter introduced me to Bento's. One night I felt for some sushi and we ordered a bunch to test them out and ever since I've been hooked. They are a little on the pricey side but it's worth it. Yesterday, my husband and I dined in and our experience was great. Great service and great food."
10/6/2022,2,"Decent food, but the wait was terrible.  I didn't get the carry out food for 45 minutes after the time they said the food would be ready.  The food itself was fine, but an overall 60 minute wait just isn't worth it."
1/2/2022,4,"I absolutely love poke bowls, so I was so excited to come here! I ordered on my phone and walked over to pick it up.  They are very particular about masks here. I don't really care either way, but they are the only place in Sunset Walk that asks you to wear them, so it's not expected.  I'd have ordered from here sooner if it wasn't for that, so be prepared with a mask.I got a tofu poke bowl,  orange tofu and taro milk tea, and shared with my husband. Taro is purple when I get it at home, so I was surprised this wasn't.  It was fine though.  The orange tofu was pretty much just like ordering Chinese food. It was good, but my husband ate most of that, which was fine The poke bowl was really what I wanted.  I absolutely love spicy mayo! I liked that you could add pineapple and mango. And I got fried tofu and spicy tofu, which was nice. It was pretty good, but I really prefer the bowls I get near me at home. And this one cost more than I usually pay for $14. However, if I went back,  I'd definitely get it again. It's also a nice healthier option on Sunset Walk.  And I like that they had other food options here, too, so my husband can get something he likes. There were several things here that I wanted to try, so I'd definitely go back again."
2/8/2022,4,"I love Bento and it's great to see them continue to grow to new locations. I have done takeout from this location several times and have dined in. They have a few tables and chairs outside and the Promenade is dog friendly, so I've been able to sit outside with my dog.Online ordering is available and what I usually do so I can just roll in, grab and go."
10/10/2021,2,"This restaurant is located in a nice complex.Bento is for you eat quick food, that's it.Pad Thai isn't good. And the poke you can create your own, good option for health meal."
5/17/2021,5,"After a long day at Magic Kingdom, my friends and I decided to pickup Bento for dinner since it was literally down the street from our cottage. The ordering process was easy via the website. My expectations were quite low for the mini poke bowl with teriyaki beef that I ordered.I was actually very surprised at the portion of the mini. It's very generous with the amount of protein, brown rice, and add-on's. The yuzu shoyu was on the side so my food didn't get soggy during transport. The avocado, onions, edamame, and mangoes were all fresh and went well with the yuzu shoyu. Teriyaki beef was tender, juicy, and flavorful too. It's crazy but I think Bento might taste better than most of the poke joints in LA. I really enjoyed my food!"
9/25/2022,1,"Oh! How the mighty have fallen! We used to love Bento so much. To the point where we would drive through horrible Friday night traffic on 192 just to get some. But their service and food quality have been tanking lately. Most recent example was their ""20 Anniversary Promotion"" where they offer a free classic roll with a $20 purchase. We attempted to use the code provided online and it failed! No worries we said, the coupon can be used in store. When my wife arrived, the team refused to help her and said to just keep trying online. She's 9 months pregnant and they turned her away. I don't normally blast a business for their disgusting service, but you bet I will go to every social media venue to make this known. I just hope their incoming Flamingo Crossings location doesn't get tainted by this awful crew."
10/4/2022,2,"Used to come here on a weekly basis. But they started consistently messing up our orders. Add on were noticeably smaller or just forgotten completely, even when i ordered extra sauce (paid for it) it would be forgotten. Don't waste your money, foods good but not worth it anymore"
6/30/2022,5,"Food was on point! You can tell the pride put into the food! Yellow curry was spot on!! Perfect spice, veggies used were amazing!! Not just thrown together! Kids loved the chicken teriyaki box. Just wished the rice serving was a bit more! Ordered food through Uber, love the bento box containers! Loved that bite of cinnamon wonton for desert!"
9/26/2021,4,"The food was good, considering I was literally 10 feet away not understanding why my sushi was in such disarray, sloppily prepared. The noodles were great I got tempura string beans which were also great, the curry chicken was delicious and mildly spicy. All in all everything was good."
3/7/2022,4,Not a bad place It's just a bit price. $15 for one roll plus included gratuity minimum 15%. Very taste!! Loved it!!
7/2/2021,4,"I just finished eating here for my second time and it was very good!Food- I got the Orange Tofu Bento Box with white rice, lo mien, cinnamon strips, green beans, and ginger salad. All of my good was incredible. My only complaint would be was my tofu was very big and chewy, but the tofu also had a very nice crunch to it.Service- Service was good. My food got out in a timely manner and had no issues. You order up at the counter. Atmosphere- The atmosphere was good.Bathrooms- Very nice and clean. They only have two unisex single bathrooms. Overall- 89/100 (Highly Recommend)"
9/20/2020,4,"First time trying Bento. They have an easy to use website so I ordered online. Bonus points for making it easy for me! They also have an app but I'm old school/just old and like a real keyboard. Mini poke bowl with tempura shrimp,  mango, asparagus,  green beans and carrots.  Tempura was good,  but we'll probably try steamed shrimp for another take out order.Egg fried rice had lots of scallions on top even though I had requested no scallions but was easily scraped off. So no big deal. Good, basic fried rice.Kid's teriyaki chicken was Mike's favorite.  Really nice grilled chicken and he liked the green beans, also.Pad Thai was nicely prepared and they omitted the peppers and scallions as requested. Thanks so much! Greatly appreciated.  Shrimp was a nice size and nicely cooked. I forgot to request a low spice level, so the dish was kinda spicy for us. I tried adding some lime juice and some of the sweeter sauce but still kinda spicy. Next time I'll remember to request low spice.The Krab rangoon/wonton was nice but probably would be better in house rather than to-go.I was pleasantly surprised by the steamed pork dumplings. Will definitely get these next time."
6/15/2022,5,"Always on point for a quick, quality sushi meal. Clean establishment with friendly employees."
7/10/2022,5,Came with a party of six and everyone tried something different. Everything was equally delicious from the sushi to the bowls to the boxes. Will definitely mark this place as one to return to the next time we're in Orlando. I'd post a picture but the food didn't last long once it hit the table.
1/19/2022,5,Food is actually hella good despite some of the reviews and the employees were all extremely nice!  we're from vegas and tbh this is the nicest treatment we've had here in Orlando
2/1/2022,4,"Bento is a solid choice anytime for tasty stir fries, poke bowls and sushi.  I regularly visit for boba tea and poke bowls with tons of customizable options. On today's visit there was a wait to receive my food as the kitchen was backed up - and this has been consistent for a bit.  My biggest suggestion is to order early - then you'll have less of a wait in the restaurant.  Use the mobile app!"
7/4/2022,3,"This place is SO slow - it's took over 30 minutes to get 3 rolla. I ordered in advance, showed up at the time it was supposed to be ready and I've been waiting for my order. I can't even rate the food because it's not ready. Won't be coming back."
7/27/2021,5,The fast food version of Asian food.A lot of choices and options for your needs and wants!The staff are friendly and helpful! I love their food And bonus is the decor is modern and cool!
6/24/2020,4,"Better than your average fast casual Asian spot. Bentos is conventiently located in the Sunset Walk plaza of the Margaritaville Resort area and Island H2O water park. This plaza is great for tourists and locals alike to shop and dine. Bentos offers some fast casual pan-asian flavors via noodle or rice bowl, sushi, poke and boba tea!The set up may remind you of other fast food style asian eateries, but what i love about Bentos is their various flavors on their menu. You can get Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean flavors fused with American influence. I usually shy away from places that have too much on the menu but they execute very well. Their bowls are where it's at! You have various choices for a base (white or brown rice, and 3 kinds of noodles).  Great choices for protein (chicken, tofu, steak, shrimp, veggies) and all kinds of sauces. My favorite being Pao pao sauce. It reminds me of the honey walnut shrimp at chinese restaurants or the ""white sauce"" from Japanese tepanyaki places. Their sushi choices are also pretty good for a fast casual place.  Definitely above average.This Florida-grown company is developing steadily with locations centered around college campuses, but so glad they popped one up closer to where I live. The staff are all friendly and while we are in COVID, maintain their use of masks, social distancing, and lots of visible cleaning.  Their to-go game is also strong.  Love supporting this home grown business.  Keep it up!"
3/5/2021,4,"From the first time I tried Bento up in Gainesville to now, I have loved their variety and reasonable prices. They are also pretty consistent in their food quality, regardless of what location you go to and what city you are in. This is a fairly new Bento location and I love how modern and sleek it looks, with the large glass windows and modern, hip interior. I got what I got most of the time: Spicy Cream Chicken Rice Bowl. I love how the chicken has a good breading on it, but not too thick. Just enough to soak up the creamy and slightly spicy sauce. Paired with the crunch of the green beans and the fluffy rice, this is a go to order here. But be warned, food coma comes quickly with this dish. Best have the coffee ready or you'll find yourself napping afterwards lol."
4/8/2020,4,"If you love sushi or are new to it, this is a great place to try out different flavors for a low price. My favorite is the sushi combo. It includes an 8 piece California Roll and two 4 piece specialty rolls of your choice. I always get the Special Mexican and then I vary on the other roll. The combo also comes with soba noodles and a small side salad all for about $10.The set up is quick/table service. You order at the counter then they give you a number and they bring it to you when it's ready. You can also order ahead for pick up or delivery. They aren't just known for their sushi but also their namesake, Bento boxes. They have such a great selection and can satisfy the most picky eaters. My mom loves their pineapple fried rice and teriyaki chicken. They also offer delicious boba teas.Stop in and give them a try!"
2/27/2021,5,"We ordered the combo box with the California roll, Japanese Bagel, and Fried Avocado. We had it delivered and it took about an hour (normal) and was DELICIOUS!"
3/20/2022,2,"Stood in line for 5 minutes while an off the clock employee chatted it up with the cashier, while there was a line. Not even the worst part, they were bad mouthing a table sitting inside in front of customers. Also took over 20 minutes for two sushi rolls while they weren't busy in the middle of a Sunday afternoon. The food is decent here but don't think I'll be back because of the customer service. They all seem like their customers are an inconvenience to them and their social lives. Plus no warm welcome or thank you while ordering. Then once some of them were off they took up tables and just continued their conversations in the dining room. I hope management sees this to fix the issues. I've worked in food service for almost 15 years and have managed for a long time. This is just ridiculous."
5/16/2020,4,"We have ordered from Bento many many times and with the pandemic, we have been doing takeout. This time when I saw my sushi bento box, I was pleasantly surprised. It was presented so nicely! Side notes about the cafe:I don't think Bento has the best tasting or most creative rolls. I continue to keep going because their poke bowls and rice bowls (especially the Pao Pao Sweet Cream Chicken) are their shining stars. And I like their Milk Teas. I will say their customer service could use some help at this location; not the friendliest or reactive (the Dr Phillips staff are much better- went there for over 5 years and then moved out to Davenport). When ordering from a mobile service, they seem to avoid that area and the wait time is longer than if you were to just order from the standard line. It's also an awkward location because it's at the end of the standard line (their exit) so if you're waiting to be noticed, you have to keep moving out of the way so the standard line can exit. Overall, I do enjoy Bento."
2/26/2022,5,"A delicious fresh surprise :) we ordered hibachi and sushi and everything was really good, we loved it and will be back!"
12/11/2019,4,"A very welcome addition to the area!!  Since discovering Poke bowls a few years ago, I would drive quite a distance to get one should the craving arise, now I can get my Poke bowls on my way home from work.They offer a very decent variety of options and sizes, and they're priced reasonably.  The flavor and freshness is outstanding!  Of course they offer many other options besides Poke Bowls, like sushi, and chicken dishes.  Service is not always fast, but friendly, and the dishes are well worth the wait."
3/15/2022,2,Store was busy.  Customer service was limited and short.  Order food to go waited over 30 minutes for 1 Bento box and 2   .  What was messed up was people who order after me got orders before I did because they were eating in restaurant.  Food was room temperature when I got home.  Will not be going back.  By the way I am a local in the area.  They also don't take cash her customer left upset.
7/25/2021,3,"Needed somewhere quick to eat after a day at Disney. Their menu looked vegan friendly, but when I called to confirm they said everything had dairy, so disappointed their tofu and veggie options weren't vegan, most places that let you build your own are perfect for vegans. My kids had their kids meal though and enjoyed their food. Hopefully they can increase their vegan options."
11/30/2020,5,"We've been ordering delivery from here a lot recently thru UberEats since COVID. Their food has been very good and they do a good job at paying attention to food modifications. My only complaint about this location is that they are hit or miss when it comes to following requests for things like a side of sauce or soy sauce packets. I've eaten at 2 other bentos and this has never been an issue, and generally the rule is with each roll you get a free side of sauce. However, when I order from this location, sometimes they'll give me the sauce I request and the soy sauce and other times they won't. Or they'll just give 3 soy sauce packets for 2-4 rolls, which is not nearly enough. Otherwise, this is a good location and the food is always really good."
8/27/2022,1,I always come to bento to get the Korean or sushi or whatever I feel like I want and I have  had a poke bowl before I don't know if todays wasn't it or everyone just wanted to go home we'll the dude with glasses specifically rushing my order but there poke bowl was completely shit today no offense there food is alright but the poke so no noey and there rice they douse it in the sauce sometimes if u get a bowl
12/8/2019,5,"Wow, this place is delicious and inexpensive! My fiancé and I were looking for a quick place to eat at while we were on vacation. We weren't really in the mood for amusement park food so we were glad we found this place. This place is super close to WDW.We got the chicken pad thai and Korean bulgogi rice bowl. My pad thai was good but not the best I've ever had. I felt that it was missing its lime tanginess that I'm a fan of. My fiancé's bulgogi bowl was delicious though! Both bowls also had a generous portion of protein."
7/30/2021,5,"We love this spot whenever we are in the mood for quick Asian food. I always order their chicken teriyaki over white rice. I love how even though the meal does not seem like a lot, it's actually very filling and I love how fresh the food is. Their Boba teas are also very delicious, I would highly recommend this place."
10/30/2020,4,"Pros: 1) good is good, most of the time fresh; 2) price is ok; 3) has an outdoor seats; 4) lunch specialsCons: 1) paying system"
3/15/2021,1,"Here's an update:Owner reaches out to me and replies to my review offering to try and make things right. Gives me an Email to follow up. I've sent two emails to the email given and no one has responded back to me. So make it up to me by wasting my time writing emails to get no response? Looks like the issues start at the top hopefully it's only this location, what a shame."
2/5/2020,5,"Really nice restaurant that offers fresh healthier options for the entire family.  The prices are reasonable, food is prepared fresh and staff is friendly and attentive.This was my first time at this location and the entire area is very nice and tucked away near Margharittaville.As a local, I'm glad I stopped in. We tried a Bento box with red dragon, tex mex and of course their Cali rolls.  Yum!We also had a lo main bowl sriracha garlic bowl with shrimp... omg delish.  Yes, it has a hint of spice.   Well worth it.  Honestly, it's a ton of food and you can share.The restaurant is well decorated and restrooms are very clean!  Will definitely be back!Oh,  they have deals on Tuesdays."
8/10/2022,1,So it just seems like they threw random things in my bowl it's missing half of the items I purchased and it's all edamame which I don't order because its texture ruins the eating experience.
9/21/2021,4,"Pretty decent food. Just one sushi roll is enough for me as they a very large.Its a bit of a fast food place, as you have to queue to pay, and then wait for the food. would be a lot better if they just put some service people in there."
2/23/2022,4,Food came out in a timely manor even though the place was packed. Nice and hot food at a good quality. I would definitely recommend the Katsu Pork with Pao Pao Sauce!
1/3/2022,1,", Ridiculous bad service. Waited 20 minutes for pick up   Asked for it at counter and then found out it was in the shelf waiting. Server didn't care if we ate cold or not."
6/1/2019,5,"This new Bento location is perfect! The menu is very similar to the other locations, the food is just as good, and the staff was very welcoming and friendly for the new folks that had never been before. I always get the sushi, so I branched out to try the Bento box today and I was very excited to get it.  First, the salad was great - the dressing was perfect; a perfect amount for the size.  Next, you can choose between brown and white rice; my rice was done excellently and was just enough to eat with my main course. The beef was excellent, it was a little spicy, just as advertised. But, I don't think it was spicy enough to make problems for most people. The best part of the Bento are the little dessert fried pieces.  That is just enough at the end of the meal to leave a sweet flavor in your mouth.I'm very excited to go back and try some new combos."
1/24/2022,1,Let me start by saying I have been to numerous Bentos before and I absolutely love them as a whole.  I ordered a poke bowl via Uber Eats.  Not only did it take an hour and a half to get it (I live 4 miles away) but the order was wrong!  I called the restaurant to let them know it wasn't correct and they told me it was Uber Eats' fault and there was nothing they could do.  It was not the Uber drivers fault because Bento made the order incorrectly.  Will not be going to this particular Bento ever again.
7/19/2020,4,"Went one day to see what it was.  Ended up really enjoying a Poke Bowl...you get to pick out all the ingredients.  Went back again during one of the neighborhood's car shows.  Not sure if it's totally fair to judge them during Covid-19, but they really didn't seem to know how to handle the extra crowds."
5/22/2021,1,Has to be the worst customer service! Got a drink that tasted gross and asked if we could switch it out for just a fountain drink the girl charged us again for a fountain drink! Sushi was not good!!!! Had like to pieces each and left the rest! Will not be coming back.
10/18/2021,5,"One of our favorite spots! Often get the build your own poke, pao pao chicken, mex roll, and Thai boba tea! We go at least 3 times a month"
1/26/2021,4,"Bento is one of my weekly lunch stops. I usually order the white rice with Teriyaki Chicken. Then I smother the rice and chicken with white sauce. The sauce is so good and the reason I come back so often. The Krab Wontons  are must order side, they always come out super fresh! Right now due to covid this location does have inside dining, however their fountain machine is turned off so there are no free refills. Cokes are sold in individual cans. Water bottles are available for purchase for $.25 since free water is not currently available."
11/14/2021,5,Love everything here and they are super consistent ! They have many great choices . We eat here regularly and it never disappoints
2/23/2020,3,"The place Well let's say by far the wait for my food took for ever not kool.  The place looks well kept, it's an upscale Panda Express. Service My wife had spicy steak with rice and I had sesame chicken with rice.  We ordered at the same time.  Her food came out about 15 min after we ordered which is about normal.  This is where it gets interesting, my food came out about 20 min after her food.  LOL we ordered at the same time ( unbelievable ).  Only two guesses would come to mind. 1 they forgot to order my food or they gave my food to someone else.  FoodWell presented and good taste, wide variety to choose from sushi to lo mein. OverallIf it wasn't for the extreme wait,  I would've given an extra star.  Would I ever go back?  If I'm in the area and want Asian food then probably but I wouldn't drive 30 min again for a 30 min wait"
2/21/2021,1,"We ordered 4 menu items from this location through Uber eats. Firstly they messed my main entree and send a sesame stir fry instead of the garlic sriracha that is ordered. Secondly and most importantly none of the 4 boxes had any kind of safety seal or sticker securing my food. Even the main paper bag didn't have any kind of tape or stapler on it so I could be assured that my food was delivered safely through the Uber eats driver! In these concerning times atleast the restaurant employees or management should adhere to safety measures. Upon calling the restaurant, the manager on duty Christopher was so RUDE and plainly asked me to contact Uber eats directly and nothing they can do to resolve the issue, neither remake nor refund. I hope the OWNER Nate makes an effort to contact me and resolve this because I'm highly disappointed with the service of this location."
3/21/2021,1,"We ordered through DoorDash asking for certain things to be removed so my vegetarian daughter could eat. Over an hour later the food arrives and the meat hadn't been removed. I could see clearly that my receipt showed the order correctly,  it it was transposed wrong when putting it in their order system. I called and spoke the manager who would offer nothing. He just told me I had to call DoorDash to fix it. I emailed corporate and still have not received even a basic apology. I called DoorDash who also offered no reprieve, and escalating to their management I still have heard no word. This company obviously could care less about poor service, and would prefer to take your money and leave your family hungry. I don't recommend them."
2/23/2020,4,"Went out with my husband for dinner and decided to stop here. Great tasting, high-quality food with many ways to customize, a fancy Panda Express I'll say. My order came out normal time, but my husband's order took long.  He and I stood waiting for a least 20 minutes or more.  The server finally bought my husband's food out with no explanations or apology.  No Bueno!  I waited to eat until his food came out, finally when it did my food was not as hot.  I admit the food was delicious; I had the Spicy Bulgogi with a steam rice bowl and my husband had the Sesame Stir Fry chicken with steam rice bowl. Besides the wait time, we were delighted with food tasting. I think we will return. Hopefully, food comes out at the same time."
1/8/2021,4,"So glad to have another location of this restaurant!  My partner and I still enjoy coming here and enjoying the bento boxes as well as sushi. Things have changed a few times due to COVID, but the changes have been clearly communicated through signage as well as emails for existing customers who sign up (not too frequent either). We've not been disappointed in the quality nor freshness of anything we've ordered, whether for in house or to go. Precautions taken by this restaurant are such that they clearly are doing everything they can to keep the community as well as their employees safe and allow the location to remain open."
2/1/2020,4,"Bento is basically a quick service sushi and Asian food spot. I tend to always get sushi or poke bowls here. For $11 you can get a sushi combo box with a full California roll and then your choice of 4 pieces of two other rolls. So if you are like me and can't decide on one, this is the perfect option. It may not be the best sushi I have ever had but if you have a craving it gets the job done.This location also seems to be a bit quicker from ordering to actually receiving your food then other Bento locations I have been to. My only compliant is when they are busy the line gets long and basically goes through the middle of the restaurant so it can be a difficult to navigate around if your looking for a seat inside.If you are looking for a quick bite in the area though, this is a good spot to try."
5/11/2022,2,"First thing we noticed when ordering is the girl taking our order has no customer service skills, pretty sure she was being trained but still it's kind of common sense to not have customer service skills she had a little attitude and made weird faces at us when ordering, then while we were paying the girl training her told us ""oh by the way it's 25 min wait for sushi"" like that's could have told us that before so we could go somewhere else but whatever. Then when the food came it wasn't even that good I think the best thing was the miso soup. There was one girl that was super sweet tho out of everyone we talked to she had red hush curly hair. Overall just feels like teenagers running a place"
3/17/2021,5,Saturday afternoon meal with two boxes of goodness in Covid times. Beef Mongolian and Szechuan chicken were our choices that really hit the spot. The fresh veg and tasty sauces were brag worthy. The service was weird to order at the counter.
8/3/2021,1,Stay away. Food sucks.  Chicken old and rubbery service nothing to write home about. Never to return
2/13/2021,1,"Just had the misfortune of picking up food at this location. The poor kitchen and runner staff are working their butts off while the shift leader is standing over at the computer doing..... heaven knows what!!! She did not walk over and help those poor souls once. But what raised my blood pressure the most was not only didn't she make contact with anyone coming to the pick up unless they waited for her precious attention but when a guy came over to pick up and one she didn't acknowledge him so when he said excuse me, she raised her finger in the ..... wait position.... and walked away from him and acknowledged him when she returned, that did it for me. When I finally got my now cold food, I asked for the managers name I was told by her I can't give you the name but I can give you the corporates email. Wrote it down. I advised her I wanted her to write it down.... wow, just wow! We will never return there."
7/22/2021,4,"The food is very good.  The flavors were not very strong, probably needed a bit of salt.  It tasted fresh.  Since it was made to order, it was good.  This reminds me of Pai Wei.  When we arrived for lunch, there were a bunch of tables that were not cleaned up yet but that got taken care of after we ordered.  The service was fine"
9/20/2019,5,"Ive been to Bento twice in my life. This being the second time. I LOVE IT. Came to lunch with my coworker,  got bento boxes, a sushi roll, and yummy crab wontons.I had forgetten how BIG the portions are here. Totally worth every penny. Everything tastes good. Im not a noodle person and wanted more noodles! The pao pao chicken is delish. Not spicy at all. I am not a spicy eater, so I would know. The sushi roll couldve used a little more cream cheese but it was good. And the crab wontons- o.m.g. my favorites.This location is about 5 minutes from my job so I am very excited to come back for more yumminess!!"
8/27/2019,3,"Yay! We love Bento. The new locations are nice and cleaner than the one on Sand Lake. It's an order at the counter concept and the choices are pretty much sushi, bowls, and bento boxes. Pick your proteins and add ons and you're set with your mean. They do have some boba teas as well. I wish the prices were a little lower since it seems a bit high for what you get. Expect $15 - 20 a person, for a meal and a beverage."
1/30/2022,1,DO NOT COME HERE. I ordered my food to be told that they won't take cash and I didn't have anything but cash you should really say that before somebody orders their food .... SHITTY BUSINESS SHITTY PEOPLE Go to another Bentos!'n
2/28/2022,3,"food was okay, they are really understaff so food did take like an hour. the boba was good no complaints there."
10/21/2020,5,"This is such a great place and has so many options! I'm a big fan of their poke bowls and that you can build your own. Their are so many other choices and their portions are great. Whether your craving sushi, Thai food, chinese food or a bento box, this place has many choices for a good value. Love this place!"
7/16/2020,3,This spot is located in a plaza with other restaurants in walking distance from the margaritaville hotel. We ordered takeout and they took about almost an hour to make. The sushi roll choices are not that diverse. Seemed there was too many crab choices on the menu which I am not fond of. We got to bento boxes with spicy tuna roll and spicy salmon roll. The sushi rolls did not taste that fresh or flavorful. The bento box comes with a tiny salad and unflavorful noodles. Didn't say that on the menu so we ordered a miso soup and side salad along with it. We liked the soup and salad the best. Most likely wouldn't go back there again.
4/15/2019,5,"I recently had the opportunity to attend a media night event for this brand new Bento location, so this review is strictly about the food, rather than service, as they have not officially opened yet! As far as the actual food, let me tell you that you will not be disappointed with the flavors Bento has to offer! Check out the pictures & then visit a Bento near you to find out what I'm talking about for yourself! There's still a lot of construction going on this area, located by the brand new Margaritaville Orlando Resort, but it's beautiful & I cannot wait to see how the whole ""Sunset Walk"" looks when all of the construction is finished! Congratulations to Bento on another location, as well!"
10/2/2020,4,"We were in the area visiting and thought we will go for sushi! The sushi (Crunchy Roll) was really good along with the miso soup. It was a really good choice and defiantly recommend. The Krab wontons I've had better, they weren't that bad. Their side dipping sauces are really good!"
7/21/2021,1,"We tried to place a takeout order earlier today and the guy on the phone was rude. We tried to order ramen he said they were out, tried to order rice they were out, tried to order curry they were out. So could not even get to order. Was excited to try it out but will not be giving it a second chance."
6/5/2021,5,This spot is clean and very efficient service.  Food is fresh and tastes great.  Will definitely eat here again!
5/9/2021,1,"Slowest to-go service ever. Waited 35 minutes past the set time, which was already 30 Minutes after ordering. When I received the order one of the sushi rolls was wrong. Food was average at best."
7/6/2019,3,"I really liked the look of this place, very modern and new in a great area for shopping and dining. The food was great too, maybe a little over priced and not super authentic. But tasted good and the fish/veggies were all very fresh. Lots of options for everyone whether you like sushi or not. I ordered a tuna and salmon poke bowl and my husband got a Korean BBQ chicken bowl. I also sampled the rainbow roll, I really liked that they gave the option for a full or half roll in case you just wanted to try something new. My biggest complaint at this location was the cleanliness. The floor was very sticky and not just in one place. It felt like soda had been spilled literally everywhere. It also didn't seem that the tables were wiped down in between customers, our table was really sticky as well. Thank goodness for that hand washing station!"
5/5/2021,5,Came in today for some sushi and it was my first time visiting this location qnd concept. I ordered the TNT Roll and the special mex. Both of the rolls came out within about 15 minutes in both directions very good. I will definitely return here except somehow I spent $30. Yeah I know me better than no sushi places but definitely not Rigo. The facility was very clean. And the staff was very friendly
6/14/2019,4,"The New Kissimmee Bento location is quite a bit smaller than the other ones in Orlando, service was quick and the restaurant was clean but seating both inside and outside is limited and on a busy day can be scarce. Parking is plentiful as this is I'm a shopping plaza with many other restaurants, stores, and activities. Food was delicious and served quickly and fresh up to the normal bento standards. I was promptly greeted upon entering. I took out rather than dined in and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I would nto hesitate to return. Just be mindful if you looking to sit down on busy days that may not be an option. I love the build a poke bowl ! Don't miss out on it!"
4/17/2019,5,"This will be a short review. It's the same quality Bento food that you can enjoy at their many locations!This location just opened, so the restaurant is a lot more modern and ""brighter"" compared to their Sand Lake location. In terms of seating, I think they're about the same size.The staff is still very new so they get a pass on service, but they've been really friendly so far. I hope this location does well and doesn't go downhill from all the tourists."
12/2/2019,4,"Poke bowl was really good and fresh however the ponzu sauce is a bit more salty than I typically like and they should dice their cucumbers. Additionally when ordering online there should be no limit to the additions of veggies. Dumplings were also delicious and my husband liked how you can add a side soup or salad. Loved the ginger dressing. Also liked how you can order a mini  bowl. Great for kids, my 4 year old loved.it!!!! Really liked the vibe and concept. Would like to see one of these places open in Rhode Island (would do well in garden city area) would be curious to try other foods. Also the shop is small and I can se wit being overwhelming when busy based off the design of the line in the middle. Yum! Oh additionally they should add chopsticks to the orders. I clicked utensils and got a fork ? For poke?"
2/18/2020,1,I ordered chicken Udon noodles soup to go and it came with no chicken and on top of it the noddles on top were hard....just a overall bad experience for me...not sure if i should give it another try....i would have gone back but i live in the davenport area ... i really wanted to like this place
4/2/2021,5,"Highly! highly! highly recommend this place!!! The poki bowl took me back to sitting on the beaches of Hawaii getting fresh poki from the local restaurants! Fresh, flavorful and delicious! The sushi was off the charts delicious! We will order from this place again and again!"
4/22/2019,5,"This was our first time here. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. It's their soft opening in Margaritaville in Kissimmee, FLWe were 5 people and all were happy."
4/30/2019,4,"I was trying to find something to eat and found this new place on yelp so decided to give it a try. I ended up getting a poke bowl and jasmine milk tea boba. There are signature bowls you can choose from but I like that they also give you the option to build your own bowl.  They also don't charge you for add ons like most places do which is nice. The quality of the tuna isn't bad for what you can get around the area. $11 for poke + boba is a great deal! What I really liked: - That you can build your own bowl - The jasmine milk tea boba - the tea tastes naturally brewed and not artificial; has just the right amount of sweetness. - Great customer service! I originally got avocado as a topping but they were transparent about the avocado quality not being up to par so they will not be serving them. Instead they gave me two extra choices of toppings as an alternative.  A couple things that could be better: - I wish the poke was marinated with the sauce. I thought it was a little odd they give you the sauce on the side. - Rice vs protein proportion. They give you a little bit too much rice for the amount of protein/add ons/toppings that are given. Overall, it wasn't bad at all for a new asian kitchen/sushi spot. I would definitely come back and try other things on their menu!"
1/15/2020,5,"As most Bentos in the area this is just as good and great prices. My wife and I love the poke bowls that we create with a great selection. What ever you taste buds enjoy, they have it. Stop by if you are on vacation or try it if you are a local. Its is worth the trip."
11/27/2019,3,"Really enjoy the food here, be aware it takes forever and most times you get mediocre service. Don't forget if they are out of something that is supposed to come with your food and you don't like the substitution they offer you pay extra to get a full portion! Not sure how that works out for me but more money for them I suppose. Normally love to come here but not if I am going to be nickel and dimed because they don't have the product to complete a dish. Then you get a bad attitude from everyone that you interact with because you complained; and the manager goes sorry you already paid. Gee what a great way to run a business. Recommend: the Pao Pao chicken bowl, Pad Thai, Spicy Bulgogi and all the sushi I have had so far has been good.Don't recommend: being upset about your order or speaking to a manager nobody here cares."
4/17/2021,1,their customer service is  bad and manger is rude does not handle things correctly .the food is fair to okay but when you have to wait hours to get it and it was made a couple hours earlier not great or you pay for food you  never get and their answer is take it up with Uber or pay for it again and drive 35 minutes to get it.have emailed Uber and bento and have been left out in the cold . over 200 dollars later i have been left with subpar food first time and no food second time not sure if I want to try the 3 strikes your rule! WATCH OUT IF YOU USE UBEREATS and order both parties will leave you hung out to dry if there is any problem!
9/26/2021,2,Bad experience. Placed an online order and check out employee told me I was the next order up. Waiting 20 minutes over the scheduled time because he said he would call my name and he never did. During that time I tried approaching the counter to inquire and they kept taking next guest and not letting me come up to ask about my order which was not the next order because multiple people got their food before me. And when he gave me my food he said it just came out even though I saw him try to give my food to other guests and it had been sitting on the counter forever. Terrible service. Everyone ordering was confused and frustrated.
3/23/2021,5,We were so impressed by this place last time we are here that we had to return.  Everyone ordered something that was different than last time to give a better feel for how much we like the food.  It was just as good.  The food tastes better than other restaurants that serve similar food.  This place is highly recommended!
6/13/2020,2,"We had two bento boxes for take out - seame stir fry and garlic broccoli. Food was ready in time for pick up. The smell of the food in the car was better than the taste at home. And what about this cinnamon chips in the dish? Either you love or hate them in an Asian dish. Well, we hate them. The location is nice.But Overall the meal was a disappointment."
3/13/2021,2,"Don't expect to receive your food correctly or together. The flavors are good,  it the three times we've tried there has ALWAYS been issues with the order. It's wrong  or we get the two plates 25 minutes apart so we can't at together."
6/2/2020,5,"The location is great, wonderful for eating outside in the warm evenings. The food tastes as good as it smells. I got a rice bowl with shrimp, it was the perfect size and was perfectly prepared. Excellent service."
11/16/2019,1,"This is normally a place the wife and I come weekly but will not be returning.  This location has not been opened long and after the experience today we were not happy.  They recently opened for the day and it looks as no one did their job the previous day during closing.  The floors were filthy, tables were sticky, soy sauce jars look as if they have not been cleaned in the last week, and the service was very poor.  When the lady brought our food to the table she spilled orange sauce all over the table, never apologized, and never returned to clean it up.  I would not recommend this place."
7/17/2019,3,"My husband and I checked this place out the other day with our 1 year old.  It part of the new Sunset Walk at Margaritaville.  I've very much enjoyed Bento on Sand Lake and in Gainesville so I was excited to check out this new location closer to my home.  There isn't a lot of parking immediately by the restaurant though there is pretty big lot behind the gift shop that is adjacent to Bento.  It is a pretty small location as well and it was quite crowded when we arrived at 6pm on a Monday.  It was also very loud.  My husband had never been so we grabbed a high chair, which they thankfully have plenty of and grabbed a seat.  As I said it is small and quite crowded so there was literally two options for places the two of us could sit with a high chair.  We then looked over the menu and chose accordingly.  If you haven't been to Bento you pick whether you want a Poke Bowl, Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or Bento Box.  Then you choose meat, sauce, and any extras.  You order at the counter, are given a number to place on your table and then food is brought to your table.  Our food came out very quickly which was great.  My husband had a salmon poke bowl.  He said the salmon was great and for the price he felt he got a great deal of meat.  He was less impressed with the rest of the bowl, but said he enjoyed it enough to come back he would just try something different.  I had a Mongolian beef Bento Box.  The noodles and rice were great.  The Mongolian sauce was a bit sweet for me.  I prefer PF Changs or Pei Wei, but I have previously really enjoyed the Chicken Katsu and Spicy Korean so I think I just won't order the Mongolian again.  The salad had very little dressing, but they were more than happy to get me more.  We ordered the kids bento box for my son which for $6 comes with chicken, rice, and string beans.  It's a nice portion for a nice price though I couldn't get my son to eat any of the string beans.  Finally, I had a taro bubble tea which tasted a bit watered down.  Overall it wasn't bad and some of our issues were of our own making.  Other issues could be the newness.  We will most definitely try it again."
11/7/2020,1,"Never again. We used to love this place. But tonight they just put the nail in the coffin. We ordered for delivery at about 6 pm on a saturday night, It is now 8:30 pm and the food is still not here. Now we have hungry kids, we called them and said our order is ""lost"" like wtf! so what do you expect us to starve? the girl on the phone when we called was very unprofessional and seems like she doesn't care at all. So we spent almost $70 on NOTHING. WOW"
7/17/2019,5,"So far all the food is great! It's a order at the counter style restaurant, but the food is fairly high quality! My vegan tofu Poke bowl was really good! Everything seemed high quality and fresh. The staff was friendly and the shop clean. We arrived around noon on a Wednesday and there was plenty of seating. Maps doesn't take you directly here... but if you follow the directions and just look around, you'll see it. There is ""street parking"" right outside. It's a easy stop for lunch or dinner. We will probably be back."
8/2/2019,5,Very delicious. Got delivered using Uber eats. We want to something different in this is nearby. Had good reviews. Food turned out delicious. Only thing I wish the portions were Cut up a little bit more. Everything is just kind of big. It definitely pays to have a knife or utensil to cut your meet up. Possibly the broccoli too. Otherwise this place seems to be pretty consistent at the various locations.
1/21/2020,4,"Florida-based chain that has decent fast Asian food. They have a Poke/Sushi menu and a Stir-Fry menu similar to Pei Wei.The Poke side is healthier with lots of included add-ons. There's also an assortment of drinks (including the area's few boba places). If they weren't pre-made and you can adjust the sugar levels, it would rock! But this place gets the job done for an efficient lunch spotTip: Take advantage of BOGO milk tea and $6 Teriyaki on Tuesdays"
2/28/2021,1,"We had to go order it wasn't a small order it was over $110 both kids bento boxes were  ice cold one piece of chicken for each box last time I looked when you get a sweet-and-sour chicken and you should have more than one piece of chicken and not eight pieces of pineapple, the broccoli was so cold it was like you pulled it out of the refrigerator. We ordered four sushi rolls they gave us two sushi rolls we ordered eggrolls they never were in the bag my curry bowl was supposed to have extra chicken it did not the crab Rangoon was so ice cold that it wouldn't even pull apart when you try to eat it. This place was subpar this evening I don't recommend anybody going I'm getting to go it was horrible and what's worse is we're local people so I encourage everybody to not go there pick a different place"
2/19/2021,1,"I cannot comment on the food as I waited over 70 minutes past my quoted time.  I understand that Friday evenings tend to be busy, however this wait time exceeding a quoted time by this deficit is laughable.  Online ordering was quite easy.  Everything else about my experience was bad.  No apologies, no complimentary beverage, not even a manager saying hello.  Thankfully I was refunded my money.  Wasting my time was on me.  Never again. Best of luck and hopefully my experience was a one-off."
5/20/2020,5,"Ordering from Bento during the pandemic has never disappointed. The taste is always consistent and delicious. We love how everything is packaged and delivered. Not once has it been delivered with sauce spilling or an excess amount of plastic wrap.Kudos to you Bento, you know what you're doing."
9/18/2020,1,AWFUL!!!!!! Worst service ever music is too loud to hear when you are muffled with a mask. Mask fine loud music needs to go... Stupid girl messed up my order and tried to act like it was my fault I don't ever need to come here again.
12/31/2020,1,Our bank account had fraudulent activity and all we had to use was cash and they refused us because that's all we had. Wouldn't even make any exception. Absolutely ridiculous. So we took our business elsewhere and found a better Asian restaurant who got our money instead.
7/18/2019,5,"Fabulous place, Good is very tasty!!!! Portion size is more than enough. This is my second time going and I will be back. Love the location and the staff is very nice and helpful"
7/2/2021,5,Solid bento place. Wasn't hungry but kept eating and eating. Both Katsu chicken and orange chicken we're delicious
7/16/2019,5,"This is a chain but I've liked other locations In Orlando in the past so thought I'd check it out.  Service is good and staff is accommodating and helpful with menu questions.  It is clean and the staff works to keep it that way.  My first trip I had a sushi bento box.  Three small sushi rolls served with salad and fried string beans.  The bento offers a choice of 2 and I had Spicy Tuna and the Mount Fuji, along with the standard California Roll that comes with it.  Everything was fresh and come out in a timely manner.  You get 4 pieces of each.  The sushi is well rolled and the dish presented well.  The second time I had the Bugogi bento box.  The meat was tender and well spiced.  The location is in Margaritaville so you might have to walk a little but totally worth it!"
4/28/2019,5,"Cute fresh place here at Subset Place. One ordered a bento box with rice, ginger salad, lo mein, string beans and Szechuan shrimp filled with carrots, snap peas, broccoli, scallions, all with a sweet and spicy garlic sauce. A poke bowl with brown rice, tuna poke, salmon poke, masago, avocado, pineapple, shiitake mushrooms, fried garlic, scallions, with yuzu ponzu. It was tasty and devoured. Last item ordered was a red dragon signature roll which is tuna, shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. It was all freshly made and came out within 10 mins. See pics of each meal. ;)"
7/13/2019,4,"This fast-casual Asian place hits on a number of points: affordability, cleanliness, and variety. There are so many delicious combinations that you can make from their simple menu, and it's easy to read and comprehend. It's also quite affordable, as $10 can get you a number of bowls that are quite filling. This place is also new and clean, and we noticed several workers cleaning and wiping tables/windows down while we were there. Way to stay on top of it! Bento AKS could, in my opinion, deliver more flavor and sauce to their meals. My lo mein bulgogi was a bit dry and was nowhere near the ""spicy"" that was claimed on the menu. My wife's yellow curry lo mein was similar: noodles quite dry with little sauce to add that extra ""oomph"" to the meal. However, that wouldn't stop me from going there in the future; I'd simply ask them to add more sauce to the dish! Check this place out!"
6/3/2019,4,"Really good, fresh sushi. My order was mixed up and the staff graciously fixed it. I thought the bento box wasn't going to be enough, because I came in hungry as a horse, but it was perfectly filling. If I wasn't visiting town from California, I would definitely be back. But recommend toEveryone who is near by!"
4/17/2019,5,"This place just did a soft opening this week. The entire menu was available! Service was great. Friendly and helpful staff and they continuously came by to check on us. They have a wide variety of food. Everything we had was great. We had chicken vegetable stir fry, udon soup, poke bowl, and a roll. We all enjoyed it. The amount of food given for price is beyond what I was expecting. Will definitely visit again!"
9/19/2020,4,"It was good food! Good portions! The crab Rangoon is my favorite!  I also really enjoyed my pad Thai, could have more sauce though!"
5/5/2019,5,"Love this place! Let's start with the amazing staff. Everyone was super friendly and willing to help. Clearly they have assembled a stellar team and have trained everyone well. You guys were great. Now on to the food. I got the vegetable store fry with tofu bento box and my husband the sweet and sour chicken bento. The portions were filling and the food was fresh and well cooked. My only feedback is preferences based, I would have liked less sauce. In the scheme of things, not a big deal and did not impact the quality of the dish. My son ate my leftovers and had no complaints. The prices are reasonable, generally $10-$12 for most dishes. With their on trend menu consisting of sushi, bento boxes, poke bowls, and more traditional noodle and rice dishes, Bento is ready to take over the world of fast casual pan-Asian food and I am looking forward to it."
10/17/2020,4,Ordered a bunch of food for takeout via grubhub. Order was ready fast and everything was correct and good. Pleasantly surprised. Would definitely order again.
8/1/2019,5,Surprised that a place like this is in the Orlando area.  This concept is simple and its amazing this system hasn't made it to other parts of the country.  There is a staggering number of combinations with which to work with and they have the ability to customize things the way you want.  Food is fresh.Staff is incredibly well trained.  Very welcoming and friendly with a minimum of wasted motion.  The Apple maps app strangely does not work for this place.
4/16/2019,5,"Bento is amazing, and this new location is great! The staff members are all super friendly and love to make suggestions and are very knowledgeable about the menu. The food is delicious and fresh, and you get a lot for a low price. This location also has boba tea (be sure to grab a boba tea punch card!!!) and plenty of space to hang out and enjoy. I always get the sushi combo box or bento box and leave very full and happy! Great location, so happy it's now open!"
3/3/2020,5,"To say that I go here a lot is an understatement. Everyone knows I love sashimi and bubble tea. Bento has both of these, made deliciously and at a great price. I LOVE this location. It's so nice to walk around this area, light music playing outside and happy people all around. It's right next to the Margaritaville resort in the shopping area called Sunset Walk. Its really nice and chill with lot's of stuff to do, and decorations, so it is really nice to sit outside and enjoy a bubble tea or a sushi roll. Of corse, I always get the poke bowl, I love the build-your-own. I get rice, salmon poke, avocado, and wakame. They have 3 different build-your-own sizes, so if you get the larger ones you can get more types of sashimi and more toppings! I always get the yuzu ponzu sauce on the side and furikake seasoning on top. Honestly you cant go wrong with this whole menu, I think I've tried it all. Other dishes worth mentioning are the Orange bowl and the Szechuan bowl. You can get either with your choice of chicken/steak/shrimp/tofu as the protein, and noodles/greens/rice as a base. Milk boba tea is my fav and never disappoints. I love Bento and this location is especially premium!"
7/25/2020,5,"Amazing takeout every time. Food is always right, and the meals are neat and filling. I wish there was more variety with sushi but the noodle bowls have become a huge hit in our house! Definitely have been multiple times since the start of Covid and will keep going back"
4/18/2019,5,"We were so lucky to find such a delicious restaurant nearby our hotel. The food was both authentic but also different with their flair for fusion, and clearly the best food we have eaten all week in Orlando! The menu has so many options and combinations at first we didn't know what do choose. But everything we ordered came out so tasty. The fusion of flavors was outstanding, I especially liked my Korean bugolgi with ramen noodles. Never had it this way before and it was the best.The yellow curry was superb, very authentic and rich. A great balance of flavor and spice. And the staff was very friendly and attentive, checking to make sure everything was perfect. Thank you!Next time we are in Orlando this is definitely our first stop for food!"
5/12/2021,5,"I have not been disappointed yet! The kimchi, sweet n sour, orange chicken,  and a few other options were all good! Will definitely continue to go back!"
4/3/2021,1,"IF YOU WANT CHINESE FOOD NEVER GO HERE Absolutely terrible service. I wish I could even say the food is ok if I would have gotten my order. The employees are clueless. They don't even know their own store's phone number. These people suck. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box and they told me 20 minutes. When I went back in in 20 minutes, there was nothing. They acted like they didn't even know that we ordered. I went in, and the place was packed. There was NO social distancing at all and they had no safety measures. When I told them that I had ordered, they said that they had no order placed under my name. I was furious. I went back to my car and got my phone to tell them that I had called THEIR number. They then proceeded to bumble like fools. They tried to argue over wether or not I placed an order 30 minutes ago. The man behind me in line came to pick up the order that he placed online for delivery 3 HOURS AGO. THESE FOOLS THEN PROCEEDED TO ARGUE WITH HIM TOO. I hate being this person, but if I could give them negative stars I would."
6/14/2019,5,"This place was awesome! Food was delicious! Service was greet, one of the cooks explained to us the dishes and which one he recommended best! We got the food very quickly and this place was very clean"
12/9/2019,4,If you're looking for a quick Asian meal this is the place. Hot or cold dishes they've got it covered. The miso soup is delicious and have yet to try anything that wasn't wonderful after visiting 4 times.
12/1/2019,4,"This place is great. I am not a salad eater. Never have been, but I am a believer after having the mini poke salad with teriyaki chicken pinapple edamame and fried onions with teriyaki sauce. There are tons of other combinations but this is my forever order there. Its amazing. My wife gets the salmon and rice and never says no to going there for a light healthier dinner. Give it a chance you won't be disappointed."
1/2/2020,1,"I called and placed an order, verified my phone number to the employee taking the order, and provided the name of the individual that was to pick up the order. Surprisingly, the location of this restaurant was actually much further than Yelp indicated. When I arrived at the restaurant, the employees informed me that the order had not been completed and they also stated that the restaurant did not have the necessary components to make one of the rolls. However, the employees at no point contacted me to inform us of this. After changing the order, I went to a nearby store to give them time to prepare the modified order. Over 25 minutes later, the order had not been complete. I had to wait nearly an hour to receive my order. At home, I noticed that they had not accurately substituted shrimp in my role. In addition, they provided no chopsticks for an order of only sushi, only a few packets of soy sauce for 4 rolls, and only one slice of ginger per roll. Overall, I found the customer service to be terrible, the orders to be inaccurate, and the food to be lackluster. I especially would not recommend this establishment as they could not even correctly put the order under my name accurately. - sincerely not Gabriella!"
5/11/2020,5,Awesome and delicious surf n turf is my favorite bowl! 100% recommended i had a great experience every time sushi and everything is great
12/28/2019,5,"VEGAN REVIEW! While on vacation in the area, we (the vegan family) ordered poke bowls from this joint. They were awesome! The rice, white and brown, was very fresh. The fruits and veggies that we topped the rice with were also very fresh. Loved the ginger dressing! I highly recommend for healthy, WFPB, vegan meal!! Yum!"
3/26/2021,2,I order Sushi Combo Box aunt I miss stuff on the sushi and I order white sauce and I miss you too
3/21/2021,5,"We placed a really late order at 9:30pm and they delivered amazing food promptly, the food was delicious highly recommend!"
2/13/2021,1,"First time here, pickup order supposed to be ready at 8:25. Showed up at 8:38 and told it would still be another 10-15 minutes... final time of food ready was 9:05. And the order was incomplete and missing food. WORSE service and experience!"
8/21/2019,4,"The place is very nice. Some of the staff was very friendly. The sushi box was amazing. We also got the white rice bowl with teriyaki chicken. Although the rice lacked a lot of flavor, the chicken was great."
9/24/2019,5,"We enjoyed the other option for building a bowl on the menu. My choice was on the From The Kitchen section. On this menu you choose a base, pick from various entrees that are customizable, or you can go with a signature bowl. Mine was Teriyaki - which had white rice for my base, which came with peas, with teriyaki chicken and steak (I added an addition protein). The meats were grilled perfectly and were both extremely juicy. The teriyaki sauce wasn't overpowering in sweetness, and I got mine on the side as to add the amount I personally wanted. She was in the mood for something a little more fresh, and opted is much better about her veggies that I am. So she went with the Veggie Stir Fry - which consisted of a white rice base, broccoli, mushroom, carrot, snap peas, red bell pepper, zucchini, soy garlic sauce, and shrimp for the protein choice. The entire bowl was full of a delicious mix of the garlic and soy sauce."
1/23/2020,5,Amazing food and friendly staff. Have eating here twice now and every time is the staff is friendly and the food is great. Have not had an issue before at this place and I don't see one coming.
11/11/2020,2,Fast food style Asian - ok at best.  Neither of us would go back. Had noodle and rice bowls.
7/20/2019,2,"When I first saw this place I was so excited because I love all Asian food and the seemed to offer a variety.  Maybe I should have followed my first mind and just got the poke  bowl; because really how can you mess that up. However,  I didn't follow my first mind. The sushi was ok. It was comparable to fresh grocery store sushi.  I ordered the pineapple fried rice, which I've had at several other places, and I couldn't eat it and threw it away. My son ordered the veggie bowl with children with ramen noodles. Threw that away too. The flavor was not horrible but his noodles tasted bad. My husband ordered the koren bowl with lo mein noodle. His food was eatable. It was definitely a waste of my money."
12/4/2020,1,Sushi is not fresh. I didn't like it at all. Came from NY to spend money in a frozen sushi? Nah!
11/25/2020,5,Great sushi! The fried rice was the best I've ever had. Ordering again twice in one week.
4/17/2019,3,"This is just another restaurant for the tourist in an overdone and overcrowded shopping center. Honestly the food is good but, not worth the price. For the same price you can go to a sit down restaurant and have someone wait on you. This is more like an upscale Panda Express. You have to wait in line to place your order then they give you a table marker and bring the food to you. There are too many great local restaurants to settle for high end fast food. The food portions were plentiful but, I am willing to bet that in a couple of months the portions will be half the size."
6/9/2019,3,"It was pretty much just a Pei wei, but i didn't try the sushi.   I will update this after i try it because i heard it was really good but the veggie spring rolls were so so, the Krab wontons were definitely sub par, and the garlic broccoli with shrimp over ramen was pretty salty."
7/27/2019,5,"Really refreshing slushes with boba or jelly! I had the lychee slush with lychee jelly and it was amazing. We were only there for the summer drink on a hot day but saw the lunch crowd and decided to give it a try. This was the only busy establishment in Sunset Village at Margaritaville. We shared the lo mein with Gen Tso's  chicken in a bowl and the sushi combo ( 8 pc California and 2 of the 4pc regular rolls) - fresh and yummy! I really liked the poke soy sauce that comes with any roll...you have a choice of various sauces. Bright and clean atmosphere...staff are constantly clearing tables, restrooms are large and clean. Keep up the quality of the food and cleanliness!"
7/22/2019,5,"Food is so darn good, like an Asian food chipotle. Seating is a little cramped and weird. Cashiers BARELY know how to be a cashier, and know literally nothing about the menu. This score is 100% about the taste of the food."
5/18/2019,5,"This place has it all poke bowls, sushi, boba tea, noodle bowls, rice bowls bento boxes and the food is all made to order.  You order at the counter and then they bring it to your table.  This is like if Pei-Wei but so much better!!  I had the Korean Steak rice bowl and the person I was with got Bulgogi Bento Box and I also had sushi which was fresh and tasty.  Definitely coming back here to try everything on the menu!!"
7/6/2019,5,"Food is amazing, sesame stir fried anything is fantastic! Orange chicken is good, wish they put more sauce in the bowl. The sushi, oh man the sushi... amazing! TNT roll=amazing... MT Fuji roll = heaven! And the Boba Tea... oh man, i tell you what... speechless. 10/10 would go back."
5/17/2019,5,"New place on HWY 192.  Food is good, staff friendly and very clean environment.  It has become a regular for us."
6/23/2019,4,"We ordered the build your own Poke Bowl via Uber Eats and they were fantastic. Very fresh, great flavors. Steamed dumplings were also really good. Was not impressed with their side salad so will steer clear of that in the future, but the portions and freshness of the poke bowls more than made up for it."
6/22/2019,2,"2 stars for bad service and mediocre food.Ordered 2 kids meals a sushi box and 2 order specialty sushi. 4 soda and 2 sides white rice. Total was $66 that was the first disappointment. Sat down at a table got a number. They brought out the rice first then the 1st kid box. About 10 minutes later another kid box came out , then another 10 minutes went by and we got our sushi box. The kids box was really the only positive. The sushi box had spicy tuna and the Cali roll. It was the worst bland non tasting sushi I have ever had. We all finished that food and still didn't have our full order. Then they brought the other sushi to the wrong table then when the people there realized it wasn't what they ordered the folks at bento sushi decided to them bring it to our table. I got my $22 back.Point blank if you like and want sushi this is not the place to get it."
8/17/2019,2,"We have eaten at Bentos in our hometown of Gainesville FL many times and have never have a bad meal. However, while on vacation here in Kissimmee we decided to try what we thought would be a good choice of the many eateries that exist in this area. Margaritaville is still quite new and Bentos is one of the restaurants in the development. We ordered and waited to take back to our resort that was not too far away. We had to wait 30 minutes or so and were not the only disappointed customer who was waiting for their take out. The place got crowded after we placed our order at about 9:30 on a Saturday night. Another party of 7 or so came in and sat down for dine in. They started receiving their food before we got ours which was ordered first.Continuing to wait we saw more customers come in and order and they too were now subject to waiting for their food. We finally got our food 30 minutes later and on visual inspection was nothing like our home Bentos.We get back to our room and ate the meal only to find the veggies (broccoli and snap peas) too hard to eat. The portion was smaller than our usual eatery. The rest that was shrimp, rice and a scattering of peppers were ""ok"" - at least the shrimp was cooked and not rubbery.We will not be returning to this location."
8/11/2019,5,"We come to Bento almost weekly and always enjoy our meals -- everything is fresh, there is variety (something for everyone) and the service is friendly. We had one error in the many takeout visits we've had and the manager remembered us BY NAME the next time we came in. We were very understanding because we know that this happens, but she really and went above and beyond to make it right. We've always enjoyed Bento but we're a sucker for great customer service and they now have our full loyalty!"
8/7/2020,1,"I went to Bento last week and was extremely disappointed that their employees were not wearing their masks correctly to protect their fellow coworkers and their customers. I ordered my food and waited in the seating area and saw employees with the masks under their noses while preparing the food. None of the employees corrected their coworkers or advised them to pull the mask over theiwhich is very disappointing. I brought my concern up to the cashier and I kept an eye on him as I left with my food. He didn't go to the manager, he just went back to whatever he was doing. Also, while I was waiting for my food, they also allowed a couple to order food who did not have shoes on and only had a T-shirt covering their mouth. I will not return since they don't seem to care about public health and safety."
6/30/2020,1,"Place an order and was told it would be 30-35 minutes. Got to the restaurant and paid and was told the food wasn't ready. After waiting an additional 30 minutes past when they said it would be ready. I was handed cold food. When I got home to eat, there was chicken mixed with my tofu. I don't eat meat so I had to throw out my meal. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, meat eating or not."
6/25/2019,4,"Bento is a solid, quick-eats restaurant. They make nice simple sushi rolls, beautiful bento boxes and would have received a five star review if they didn't run out of boba so often. They are new to the area, so it is possible they are still figuring out how much boba they need each day, although, they offer a punch card for boba, so should be better stocked.I would not make a special trip only for a Boba. In fact, I do not go there for boba any longer, because they do tend to run out often.  However that being said, they are called Bento and do live up to that name. It's definitely worth your time to stop in and have a bento box here."
6/16/2019,1,its father's day and half my family for there meal COLD and not right and the rest of us got forgotten about this is my first meal of the day im starving been here for a half an hour and it's super busy they don't give a fuck... i ask to speak with a manager ect it's just so unorganized they food is rushed this sucks i want my money back! currently sitting at this fuckinf table still haven't ate!
4/4/2020,2,First time having Bento - we did carry-out and they forgot the sauce I ordered on my Poké Bowl! Sauce probably would have taken my meal from a 6 to an 8.
2/5/2020,5,Very good- fresh ingredients. Well flavored. Salmon poke was excellent. My sons had sushi rolls and a different poke bowl and they ate all of theirs! Mom win!
2/16/2020,1,"This was the first and LAST time we will eat at this establishment. We checked out the menu before we arrived and they said they offered brown rice upon request. So we waited in a long line for about 20 minutes just to find out, while we were ordering, that they didn't have any brown rice made. My husband asked if the were making some and the guy said ""No"" and that they won't be making anymore tonight, even though they were still going to be open for few more hours. We went ahead with our order with white rice because we didn't want to take the time to go somewhere else. Then my husband ordered Boba tea and they were out of Boba. NO SIGNS ANYWHERE saying they were out of these items. We sat down at a table and waited for our food. The place was packed and there was only one table cleaned off. There was a four person table next to us that had rice spilled all over it and dishes that hadn't been picked up yet (a couple with two very small children had just finished eating at that table). Since it was the only table that was free a lady and her two young sons sat there while her husband went to order food. Nobody came to clean off the table even though two employees walked passed the table and looked at it. She had to ask someone to come clean the table off. The employee had an attitude and picked up the dishes. She came back with a rag and wiped all of the rice that was spilled on the table onto the floor and seats. She didn't even clean everything off the table...she just walked away. So now there was rice all over the floor and on two seats. This wasn't a little bit of rice, there was at least a half a cup The lady went to get napkins to clean up the rest of the table and clean the rice off the chairs since the employee never came back. I started looking around and noticed that the place was dirty. The floor was sticky too. My husband received his food but I waited another 15 minutes for mine. The bathrooms were filthy and they were out of paper towels. The only good thing about this place is the food was good, but after seeing how dirty the dining room and bathrooms were I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like and that's all I could think of while eating my meal."
7/7/2019,3,Was looking for a Sushi place near my resort in Florida when we went on vacation. Sushi is decent as my son and brother ordered them. I ordered the udon soup with tempura which is decent but not the best as the tempura is small and batter is not flaky. Bulgogi beef is not what I expected and pad thai is just ok. Staff are friendly. Worth another trip? Maybe but not on my A-list.
6/23/2019,5,"Was craving sushi and found this place. Such a good variety. My favorite thing we ordered was the kids box. This was the best ""kids meal"" we ever ordered. Highly recommended. Delicious!"
9/30/2019,5,"While on vacation in Florida, I desired sushi and came across Bento. The fish was delicious. Everything was fresh and quick service. The staff was friendly. They should bring this to NY"
4/21/2019,4,Food is good. My husband had the yellow curry and my son the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were fresh and tasty.  My poki bowl was very good and the teriyaki steak was tender.  This place is fairly new and the staff is friendly.  The boba tea tasted genuine.  This is definitely a come back again place.
6/14/2019,2,Honestly had high hopes. Had the pineapple fried rice with steak. Fried rice had the texture  almost same as oatmeal.  Steak was lackluster and nill seasoning.  Wasn't impressed.
5/31/2019,2,"Not at all what I expected from the branding.  Not terrible food but not great either.  Similar to ""pei wei""...I would consider it fast food Asian.  If you love and appreciate sushi, avoid it here at all costs...you will certainly be disappointed. I feel like we are accepting less and less quality as a society every time a place like this opens."
7/26/2019,2,"I was willing to give this place another chance after one bad experience. Long story short, I was given a tonkatsu ramen soup with no soup broth. (Just noodles and chicken strips on the top. That's it.. ) from a take out order. I decided to visit today and order up some food after a long, stressful day at work. I made my order and I asked a question to the cashier concerning my last one as if it was normal for this restaurant not to include the actual soup, she only responded with ""Sometimes yes and no"" ... That doesn't answer my question, but okay. (Gave a 10% tip even though she didn't really deserve it in my opinion.) No sense in stressing over a order I made a while ago. I just wish I had more of an explanation or an attempt to make up for it. I sit there and wait for my order, which was a pad Thai and volcano roll sushi, and I received someone else's by mistake. I informed the waitress that this isn't the sushi I paid for and gave it back. They handed the sushi plate to the guy who also had my order and just allowed him to keep both. So I had to wait for mine again.. Easily up to 10 minutes. I barely touched my pad Thai from being so upset... And when I finally received my sushi order, it was clearly rushed. Didn't look nearly as nice as advertised or the plate that other guy had. The roll was barely cut and it was smothered and drenched in mayo with barely any masego eggs and there was no crab meat on the top or all around. I've had this roll before from this same location and it was so much better than what I received just now. Someone did arrive to briefly apologize and offer me a small Boba tea and I appreciated that at least.. (Sadly, it didn't taste good at all. The tapioca balls were mushy and tasted like they had been probably sitting there all day.) Honestly, I would not come back after receiving (Pardon my language) half assed service. The pad Thai at least was decent, I'll give it that. This wasn't worth my hard earned money and I regret coming back at all."
5/21/2021,5,"I was first introduce to Bento a long time ago in Gainesville and haven't been back to a Bento in forever.  I was working in Oviedo that night and decided to Doordash from Bento.  They were about to close soon and had to place my order soon.  Plenty of variety of items to choose from on their menu, but I knew I wanted a noodle bowl so I decided to get the Orange Chicken Noodle bowl with green, red bell pepper, and green beans.  Plenty of chicken in the bowl that was season well.  Everything tasted well together and didn't seem overly salty.  I would like to try other items on their menu next time.  Food came pretty quick and it was still hot. I will more than likely order food to go from here again."
10/5/2022,1,"Very poor experience when I ordered from here on Monday (10/3/22).  I did online order ahead to be picked up at 7:56.  I arrived at that time but didn't walk out the door until 20 minutes later.  The people who were in the store line to order sat and received their food prior to me.  The communication to me about my order was poor or nonexistence and nothing was said about me waiting there for that long.  We ordered 2 rice bowls, a side of Green beans ($6), and one sushi role.  One bowl i paid the extra to get extra chicken, which was not a noticeable upgrade at all.  It still felt like a small portion.  My opinion is these bowls have a lot of rice to seem make it a decent portion. This was a $46 order and I was not satisfied at all for what I got.  Not sure if i'll try again or not."
6/28/2021,4,I have not been to Bento in such a long time but man did I miss this place! I decided to get a Bento box with beef and I was so pleased with my meal. This meal is filling without stuffing you so that you feel terrible about yourself. I love that whatever you order is fresh made and I don't mind waiting a little bit more for that. While I waited I had a boba tea and you know what?? It was actually pretty good and that makes me so happy because you cant find a lot of places in Oviedo with boba tea these days :( Prices are great and I think overall this is always such a classic stop for anyone craving quick Asian.
10/15/2022,3,Ordered ahead. Didn't get my food till about 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Food definitely not worth what I paid. I ordered noodles and a couple other things and it came out to around 70$..... the noodles came with three shrimp. Three. For the whole dish. My family and I didn't think it was worth it at all. We even got soup. Cause you know who can mess that up.... We dumped it out. It was nasty. Needless to say not going back.
12/8/2021,4,"I had not been to Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi previously, but stopped here on the recommendation of my son who had recently eaten here. The menu included a pretty Vince variety. I appreciate the range of options on the menu. While here you can order either an Asian kitchen dish, a poke' bowl, or sushi (rolls or bowls). I opted for a poke bowl; the Regular size includes 2 proteins and I selected Tempura shrimp and tuna over rice as a base. There are plenty of vegetable and topics to select from as well - all the usual suspects; asparagus, mushrooms, wonton chips, edamame, etc. There were a decent selection of sauces too, of which the staff was willing to provide a description of any I wasn't sure about. In the end, this was a nice poke bowl......This is a chain restaurant, and if I am being honest, I had lower expectations from them......but, they managed to provide a really good poke bowl that exceeds probably all of the the other chain places that I've tried. There are definitely a lot of Poke Bowl places in town to compete with and while they probably don;t top out several local small restaurants, they were definitely above average and worth a stop in. I'm interested in trying their sushi the next time I'm in as well. Everything I saw here looked tasty. The restaurant is easy to get to, it is right off of Alafaya/434 in Oviedo inside a shopping center; there is plenty of parting.....while there are several restaurants & shops in the center that tend to be busy, I've never had any trouble finding parking in this parking lot. Inside the restaurant it is a line/queue style ordering, then you either sit down with a # for them to bring it to you, or you wait for it as Togo (which is what I did). The inside of the restaurant seemed to have plenty of room, The tables were well spaced out so you are comfortably distanced and not interrupted by neighboring patrons if you were to eat-in. A good experience. Looking forward to trying more things on their menu."
1/7/2021,4,"I've been doing some places on the weekends, getting takeout and watching shows on Disney+, and this place ended up on Orlando Weekly's best poke list for 2020. So I decided to come here. It's only like a mile away from my apartment, very convenient. I got a poke salad with a couple of big hunks of friend salmon, some edamame, cucumber, grape tomatoes, mango, some crispy wontons, and maybe some other stuff. With a side of Tom Yum dressing. It was very good. The salmon was cooked well. And the other little sides were all welcome pairs to the salmon. A little sweet, a little crunch, a squirt of tomato. A nice, fresh little poke salad. I was a fan. I also got the Chicken Pad Thai (rice noodles, bean sprout, red bell pepper, egg, carrot, scallion, tangy peanut sauce). This was the far better dish. Very heavy, but that peanut sauce gave it the tang it needed to not just be a grease bomb in your belly. I got a couple of signature rolls, too.The Crunch (tuna, krab delite, cream cheese, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce, panko-fried). I'm not usually a fan of the deep fried rolls, but this one was not very oily. It was nice and warm and not overloaded with sauce, which is always a risk with these kind of rolls. I recommend you get this, if you have any concerns. And the TNT (flame-seared tuna, masago, spicy tuna, cucumber, scallion, spicy mayo, tempura flakes, togarashi). This roll had a very nice, big bite of fish. It tasted very fresh and there was Just enough mayo to add creaminess to the chewing, but not overpower everything. Garlic Edamame was good, Pork Dumplings were good.Overall, this place was good. If you live in Oviedo and are craving quick, relatively inexpensive food like this, go ahead and pop in. You won't be disappointed."
12/23/2020,5,"I haven't had Bento for the longest time, and they still don't disappoint! This time we got the poke and Mongolian chicken udon bowl for lazy Sunday night dinner, both were fresh made with excellence. They are one of my favorite poke places in Oviedo/UCF area, you get a lot of toppings/protein for a very competitive price! As for the Mongolian chicken, you can really taste the burnt oil smokiness from stir frying in the hot wok. This made it so lovely and is something impossible to copy at home. I will probably come back to Bento more often!Bento to me is not just a regular Asian fusion restaurant, it's also reminiscence and nostalgia of college days. When I tried Bento for the first time in Gainesville, where Bento was born, the small town broke college girl was surprised by the value/great combo you get for the Bento box (back then it was less than $10 for sushi, main entree, salad, rice, and a dessert). Alongside that, everything was really good! I kept on coming back, pretty much had everything on the menu by my sophomore year. And I'm sure many Gators share the same memories.With that said, I'm surprised to see how far Bento has come all these years. More shops, better/more modern decor, same taste and same food, a little pricier but that's also natural inflation. Now that I'm no longer a broke college girl and am surrounded by amazing food, sometimes I forget about Bento and not as appreciative anymore. I will definitely come back more often though!"
10/24/2020,5,Their new location is nice and never had their build a Poke. I must say I was surprised on how good and packed with protein it was. Everything was fresh and can't imagine how much bigger the large is. I had the spicy tuna and salmon and liked that it had more of a kick than other Poke known places.
12/25/2021,3,"Food is tasty, always has been. My issue is that this place used to have good food, good portions, and good value for money. Across the menus prices have gone up by $2-4 and now it's like $12 for a noodle bowl with chicken. Those are sit down restaurant prices... plus they removed the Masago add on from bowls ((probably to make them cheaper to make)). Disappointing :/ Probably won't be coming back, just no longer worth the price."
4/28/2022,4,"Good food, light on meat.  Pricey for what you get..  Eat there regularly and they are light on any of the meat.  Recommend ordering double portion of meat for any of their meals/bowls."
1/3/2021,4,"Thankfully, delivery is available in our area, due to COVID. Great food. Adorable little Bento Boxes for the kids. And the Boba Thai Tea was amazing! My favorite part."
11/20/2021,1,"3 strikes your out! We have been going to bento for many many years. When I found out they were building one in Oviedo I was very excited. Unfortunately every time we've gone it has not been anything Close to what the other two Bento restaurants taste like. The first and second time the sushi taste old. The ingredients were not fresh. This last third time we found hair in a sushi roll and as soon as I went to pour my son's noodle bowl there was a bug that came out with all of the noodles. I don't know what their doing differently at that store, but we will not return."
6/9/2021,5,Not many restaurants in the area offer this type of food.The sushi bento box offers a lot of sushi.
10/2/2021,2,First time eating there and ordered the Mongolian chicken and a boba tea.  The total amount came to over $19.00! Wow! I told myself that this better be off the chain for that price! Was disappointed by the portion and the food was Lukewarm.  Boba tea was bitter and served with a paper straw that stuck to  my lips when i tried to drink it. Price was way too expensive and mediocre food.
7/19/2020,1,"Bento is one of our favorite spots because the food is always good! Only reason I am giving a one star review is because of the customer service. We ordered our typical order and got this note attached to it stating that it is an additional charge for white sauce. There is no issue that they charge for the white sauce, would have just been nice to get a quick call saying that and we would have happily added some and paid for it. Just disappointing to get your food and be missing one of the best parts!"
10/21/2020,5,I had an awesome meal. The Zombie roll looked awesome and tasted great! I got some spring rolls and they tasted great. They weren't crispy at all but that happens when you get fried things in takeout. This was my second time and it won't be my last. The servers inside were friendly and helpful when I went in to get my food.
10/15/2020,4,Decent food - did take out twice (because of Covid). . . would not hesitate to order again.
6/10/2020,5,"Normally, this is the type of restaurant that I avoid like the plague, so I am almost embarrassed about how many times I have been here already since they opened the doors to their latest location.  For the life of me, I can never understand why so many times we see restaurant after restaurant featuring the same exact cuisine fail in the same location time and time again.  This spot has held several Sushi restaurants in the not too distant past.  I think what will help Bento succeed is their variety, cost and speed of service.  Each time I have ordered so far, the items have been ready in 15 minutes or less.  They have a good variety of rice and noodle bowls representing a number of Asian flavors.  The bowls have a good mix of protein, vegetables, carbs, and sauce.  I have tried Coconut Curry, Orange Chicken, Mongolian, Thai Pineapple Rice, and enjoyed them all.  The Egg Rolls were very good, and I have enjoyed all of the Sushi Rolls I have tried as well.  One thing I like about them is you can get a half or full roll for an order.  The Fried Avocado Roll has ended up in my bag 3 times already, and I am guessing it will again soon!  This is a great addition to the neighborhood for a quick, flavorful meal that won't break the bank."
6/8/2021,1,I have never been so disappointed with an order from bento in my entire life. I spent $20 for flavorless chicken and raw veggies. The only thing good was the sushi and there was wasabi accidentally sent it all over it. The waiter was also super confusing and had no idea what he was talking about or doing. Also waited 35 minutes for food that is below satisfactory. I got a bowl with chicken and udon noodles and the chicken is absolutely flavorless and the broccoli and carrots are not even fully cooked. Super disappointing for the money I paid.
6/19/2020,5,This food is amazing and* I miss good food (from SF). The service put up with me and they all wore masks - were super clean.  The pickup process was easy and super safe. The owner really put money into the community and I love the way the restaurant looks. Keep rocking Bento!
11/11/2020,5,"I stumbled on this little gem quite by accident, and I sure am glad!!  Haven't yet dined inside, but every week, it seems, I'm craving their food.  Ordering straight from their website is still delivered by Doordash, but you forego the ""service fee"" Doordash charges above the delivery fee.  Always arrives earlier than expected and perfect temperature!We have only had some of their sushi, soup, egg rolls and their bento boxes.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious.  Their boxes are a step above anyone else's.  They add a small salad, rice, green beans and those delicious little cinnamon sugar crispy noodles (there aren't enough of those, if you ask me!)Can't wait to dine in!"
10/11/2020,5,"This place gives big portions and everything i've tried is super good. The stir fry vegetable w chicken, the pad thai, the egg rolls, Orange Chicken, and sushi is very good."
4/21/2021,5,Love this place. Sushi box is my favorite with mountain fugi THE BEST!!!  They always served on time and never have problems with my orders. People are nice and have different options for the family with affordable prices.
8/11/2020,3,"I tried a sushi box which came with a California roll and 2 other 4 piece rolls of my choice. It also came with a salad and some noodles. The sushi is decent and seemed fresh but not the best I've had. The salad had no dressing and if I was supposed to choose one, that wasn't made clear as I told the server it was my first time there. I asked for extra wasabi, but received barely 1/4 teaspoon which was hardly enough. It was my first time there so I'll give them one more shot to see how they do."
3/8/2021,1,"Have eaten at this location a few times and while the wait is usually insane or they forget sauces, I got the Korean chicken rice bowl last night and woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pains. I continued to have pains all day today and have been postponing taking an exam because it hurt to sit up. After finally going to the bathroom and deciding to pull trigger, I managed to throw up about 10 times and finally got all the bento out of my system and instantly felt a thousand times better. I've only gotten food poisoning twice before this in my life so this meal probably ruined Bento for me for good."
9/3/2020,4,The poke bowls are amazing and the sushi is really good.  The staff at this location is very nice. Management is fair if you were to ever have any issues or questions.
9/17/2020,4,"Clean, friendly, good food at great prices. Love the brown rice vegetable options. Only wish they had curbside so I could swing by with the kids more often. Broccoli garlic is always a go to. Love the vegetarian sushi options"
8/11/2020,5,"Great food, Great service.... I had the beef Katsu with udon noodles and it left me wanting more! The workers were so kind even in this time of crisis. They not only had delicious food but it was all so fresh and such a wide variety of different umami flavors, I can not want to come back!"
3/13/2021,1,ordered rolls and they were cold and premade. they even admitted to premaking rolls. if i wanted premade rolls i would have gone to Publix. this place has gone down in quality.
6/6/2020,1,Had to wait 35 minutes for a basic order and the store wasnt busy at all. They also got my order wrong but I didn't bother because it probably would've taken another 30 minutes to get it right. The UCF location was much better. Wouldn't get food from this location ever again.
12/21/2022,4,My wife and I really like the food. The service was very fast and ambiance was great. We got the Mongolian chicken and shrimp. The empolyees were super friendly would go again
12/20/2022,5,"Pao Pao box w/ shrimp was scrumptious & I love how it gives you a little bit of everything (salad, rice, noodles)! Also, if you love super spicy food go for the firecracker chicken rice bowl--it is tasty and burns real good!"
9/21/2022,4,"I've been a fan of Bento since college! I moved away from Orlando for a while but now that I'm back, I'm so loving having this location close by! I get the same thing every time (spicy cream chicken) so I can't speak for the entire menu, but this specific dish is great  I assume everything else would be just as tasty!"
3/17/2022,5,"Lunch is around the corner right?  If you haven't tried Bento, you're definitely missing out and let me tell you why: 1. More food for your finances. I always order the Bento Box cause it has a little bit of everything inexpensively .2. It's Fast Food without the unhealthy optionsNew Drink Options. 3. The Berry Hibiscus and Lavender Lemonades have snuck themselves on the menu and it's a refreshing little treat!Don't take my word for it though, try them out today and remember to their lemonades will be gone soon, don't miss out!!!#wtfisfor"
12/11/2022,2,"This place is pretty good. But man oh man I've never gotten my order in a timely manner. Regardless how I order it's always 30 min wait. And for a ""in and out"" joint that's a super long time. I mean even for a restaurant that's long. Unfortunate that they're so incredibly slow because I'd come here more often."
11/29/2022,2,"Bento is consistently average.   With so many sushi places around, Bento is not even on my radar anymore.  My wife likes it, yet I don't get it.  The sushi is no better than what Publix offers.  I have eaten at this location no less than 5 times aver the last few years and each time I think how average it is.   And be warned, if you sign up for emails or texts, it seems relentless!"
5/10/2022,3,"I've been to Bento many years ago it was so good, so when my cousin mentioned us ordering lunch here on a Monday afternoon I was excited. We ordered from their website which was very easy to navigate. Pick up was contactless and easy as well. The food was just okay. I got a Hot Lava Roll, Spring Rolls and Bento Box. They were both okay. The bento box is mediocre at best, spring rolls are good, and the hot lava roll was okay but small. Overall the food is not great but I don't know if I'd give this location another try."
11/30/2022,3,"I went this evening to get some dinner today is Wednesday, November 30, 2022 and I have the Bento Asian kitchen App. So while I'm sitting in my car I place my order on the Mobile app they told me 5:15 PM my food will be prepared and done to pick it up, so I went in a few minutes earlier and unfortunately my food wasn't ready until about 5:30 PM so I'm sitting in the lobby waiting and waiting for my food to come to me. The staff was pretty nice and courteous for the most part but for me to place my order ahead of time and have to wait Over 15 minutes pass the time they told me to get my food is a little unacceptable. They were not that busy so I don't know maybe they're short staffed in there. My food was tasty though after I finally got it I got the pineapple chicken and shrimp Bento box, now the only thing that I did not like was the salad it was just the spring mix of salad just thrown in the plate no oil and vinegar no salad dressing no nothing very plain and blah. I also got an appetizer of the spring rolls now they were pretty good I must say, I've been to this location on several occasions, but it has been a few months since I've been here. I would say I'd recommend it but don't take them on their word when they say your food will be done at a certain time and it's not thank goodness I didn't have another appointment to hurry to get to come on guys and gals get it together."
3/28/2022,3,"Ordered: bento box - chicken katsu with Japanese curry. White jasmine rice. Standard ginger salad, noodles and garlic green beans. Since it was Monday and 4ish they were doing a happy hour promo for free pairing of an appetizer (-4.00) I ended up choosing extra ginger salad. With a soda cup. Total: $18.11 + tip (15%)The BAD:1. Japanese Curry: this should be revisited. They used too much water which making it too runny and lost a ton of flavor. I was disappointed I could eat it with my chicken katsu or my rice.2. Wonton noodle crisp: it was seasoned with cinnamon. This reminded me of Taco Bell's churros lol. After small taste I left it alone. I was very confused about this side.The Good:1. Chicken Katsu: cooked and fried well with a good portion2. Noodles: we're good and tasteful3. Ginger Salad: typically and good4. Garlic Green Beans: tasteful and goodConsensus? Maybe it's not worth buying the regular portion and maybe it's worth to just buy the kids version. Pick a different sauce because I've never had watery Japanese curry... price and food didn't match. Maybe because it's new location? I'll think twice before I try this location . Who knows maybe I'll try their poke bowl or sushi at this location but there's doubt.*I was too hungry to take a picture of the chicken katsu."
5/23/2022,2,"We absolutely love the downtown location, and this more convenient location has been pretty good the few times we've been, but our dinner yesterday was disappointing. I usually get yellow curry chicken katsu, which was unavailable for some reason, so I got a regular yellow curry chicken. Despite the curry sauce poured on it, the chicken tasted like it had been washed after cooking, with zero seasoning at all. Worse, because my meal came out almost immediately, I had already finished it and boxed up my leftovers before my wife's meal arrived. (My meal was out within 2 minutes; hers took over 20.) No matter how much I like a place, that just can't happen."
12/16/2020,4,"4 stars for food4+ stars for menu choices4 stars for service3 stars for inside of restaurantBento (for short) became one of our go-to places during the various stages of lockdown this year for many reasons. First and second are the food choices - something for everyone in my family - and the food quality/taste. I've especially enjoyed the Spicy Beef Bulgogi rice bowl and build your own Poké bowl among others. I relish the customization options of the Poké bowls. My wife always orders the Veggie Stir Fry rice bowl with tofu - when you find a dish you enjoy, stick with it! Other family members have ordered and enjoyed the noodle bowl option as well. We find it to be a fair amount of food for the price. It's not the Wednesday $ rolls specials at a local grocers and it's not the $$$ specialty sushi locale, but its place is just right in the middle.I've received great service - friendly and helpful -  at this location every time, even during lockdown. When I most recently ordered for pick up, I noticed the inside was partially blocked off for delivery and pick up orders. I found that change made my order pick up easier. A few patrons ate inside without masks of course but every worker I could see was wearing a mask and gloves. As a side note, the fair pricing became clear on a recent order.  We first attempted to order from a different build your own sushi bowl place, but it was more expensive with a discount than Bento's normal pricing. Looking forward to the next time!"
12/26/2020,5,"My fiancé and I get take out from Bento fairly often. I used to get the Mongolian Noodle Bowl with udon noodles and I loved it. I recently started doing the Build Your Own Poké Bowl (pictured) instead and that has been my new go-to. I get mine with brown rice, chicken teriyaki and steak teriyaki, carrot shreds, avocado, edamame peas, and wonton chips. I'm a little obsessed. It's so flavorful and a big portion for being the regular size. It's enough for me to do half for lunch or dinner that same day and then the other half the next day. And with the white sauce mixed in, it tastes even better! My fiancé usually gets the Pao Pao Noodle Bowl with lo'mein noodles (forgot to picture) and he loves it, especially with white sauce mixed in. This one is a little spicy and a good portion as well, but he normally finishes it all at once. This is his go-to and is always craving it. For appetizers, we have tried the krab wontons (pictured) , the spring rolls (pictured), the steamed dumplings, and the fried dumplings. Every single one of these is so good, but I would say the fried dumplings are my favorite. The service here is great and the prices are good too. When we get take-out/delivery, we normally use Postmates. It's packed well, the food is still hot when received, and most of the time it delivers pretty quick. Love Bento and would definitely recommend!"
11/10/2021,5,"Good food, good prices, quick nice service. What more could you Ask for? All locations I've been to around orlando are consistently good. Great casual lunch spot fo hit around town."
6/2/2022,2,The General Tso chicken & noodles did not taste like General Tso & the bread around the chicken was hard
3/30/2022,1,"Every time I eat at Bento, I say the same thing when I leave: ""I'm never eating here again"".  The food itself is good, even if they do get my order wrong more often than not. The biggest problem is the service. It takes forever to get your food! Today, I placed an order at 6:19 PM for one Poké bowl, which I planned to eat before my 7:00 PM meeting a few miles away. At 6:35 PM, I asked the guy making the poke bowls if he was working on my order and he said yes. At 6:45 PM I asked him again and he pointed to the counter where my meal was sitting while five employees talked among themselves. After getting their attention, one of them brought my food to me, unceremoniously dumping it in front of me without even an apology. I had to scarf it down and leave. The place was not busy. There is no reason it should take 26 minutes to make one poke bowl. I'm done with Bento."
9/19/2021,5,The food is great and the menu options are awesome.   The poke bowl is fresh and the tuna used for the sushi was great
4/27/2022,5,"Exceptional just absolutely delicious. Some of the best sushi I've had. Great atmosphere, very spay and relaxing. Great tile work on the wall too. Not the cheapest but everything is made to order so no complaints at all. I would eat here err day if my wallet would let me!"
1/18/2020,3,"Went in for a quick meal and my Yelp app offers a free appetizer with a $10 purchase yet when I attempted to use it the server stated it was not for this location but the one downtown instead. Which is very odd since I have frequented this location 99% more than I have the one downtown. The appetizer offer does not list a location on it at all, only stating it needs to be dine in only and not valid for shrimp tempura.Got the shrimp pao pao and it came out good, in this order the shrimp did not have the nasty taste like the previous time so I was able to enjoy the meal."
1/28/2021,4,"We enjoyed our visit to Bento. Their place is really clean and Covid-compliant, and they make great food. We tried three of their sushi rolls: the Bamboo Roll, thr Specialmex roll, and the Hot Lava roll. Our absolute favorite was the Hot Lava roll. The roll itself contains escolar, shrimp tempura, and avocado, topped with a warm, spicy scallop and crab mixture that was delicious... yum.We also really enjoyed the Special Mexican Roll: shrimp tempura, cream cheese and avocado, topped with shrimp,  eel sausce and spicy mayo. The flavors worked really well together. We didn't care for the Bamboo Roll on its own, as it was too dry for us, but it was good when dipped into some spicy mayo.We can't wait to go back to try some of their hot dishes. Their soba noodle bowls look amazing. All in all, we recommend this place.Don't just EATTHRUUS, eat at Bento!#eatthruus"
3/12/2022,1,Still a one star . No change. The email l for the contact person on the reply was not valid.
7/2/2020,4,"I ordered takeout from here on uber eats because delivery fee was only 0.99. I think there was buy one get one free drinks as well.I got the Mongolian bbq chicken with lo mein noodle bowl. It was around $8 total including uber eats fees and delivery. It was HUUGE!! I was able to eat it for two days straight! The container it comes in is really deep and they packed it well. I was really impressed with the serving size! The only thing was that it was too saucy so it could get overwhelming at times. Would order again if I needed something quick, cheap and filling!"
5/24/2019,5,"Have you ever BEEN TO BENTO BEFORE??  Say that 3 times fast: BEEN TO BENTO BEFORE BEEN TO BENTO BEF-.. sorry, just being dumb, lol. Got myself a POKE BOWL consisting of Tuna, Salmon, Masago (fish roe), Cucumber, Jalapeno, Wakame (seaweed), Scallions, Tempura Flakes, and Spicy MayoQuite delicious, could taste the freshness.  You could say it was 'So fresh and so clean clean, lol.  The crinkle cut cucumbers gives it a fancy touch too.Definitely liking this place!"
5/28/2021,5,"Another visit. This time I ate the Lomein with Tofu, and drank a fountain beverage. Quick, easy and delicious."
5/26/2020,3,"Ordered takeout from this Bento location and wasn't impressed. The sushi was warm and tasted like it had been sitting out for a bit, even though I picked up my order on time. The spicy beef had a good flavor, but the salad in both bento boxes was wilted and underwhelming. I usually order from the Bento restaurant in Altamonte Springs and have never had an issue there. Maybe this location was having a bad night, which is understandable with everything that's going on. I will say they had their kitchen and cash register sectioned off from guests with tables, and it seemed like they were taking all of the necessary precautions for health and safety."
3/23/2021,2,Ugh...really disappointed with this location. First time here as I usually go to the downtown or sand lake ones. I substituted my lo neon for more green beans which is an extra cost (+$$$). I got literally 8 extra green beans spaced out in the bento box. Unbelievable. Food tasted fine. I was in a rush or would've complained. It was like visiting chipotle with the skimpiness.
12/23/2021,4,Love this place!!! Love the bento boxes! Super great milk teas and a great staff ! Lovely
1/20/2020,5,"First time here to actually eat. I've been here several times to pick up deliveries for UberEats and Postmates and have always wanted to check it out. So my boyfriend and I came during lunch hour, around noon on a Monday. It was steady busy but our order came out fairly quickly. I got the Bento Box, Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken. My boyfriend got the General Tso Chicken Rice Bowl. The portions in the bento box were perfect. I devoured everything; lo mein, ginger salad, and green beans. The pineapple sweet and sour chicken was perfect. Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.. There is plenty of seating available inside with some tables to enjoy outside as well. The place is clean and staff is friendly and patient. From delivering through UberEats or dining in, always great customer service."
12/7/2021,1,"Used to love eating here, but not anymore. This location refuses to take gift cards, the menu prices have gone up about 4$ for every item on their menu over the last 2 years. It used to be 8$ for a rice bowl, it's now 12$. The bento boxes used to be 10$ now they're over 15$. The new prices are outrageously over priced for the food you get. Definitely not gonna be eating here anymore."
1/27/2020,1,WowSmhI've never had this happen before in my life such poor poor poor service the food was actually pretty good but I got up to refill my drink and the server took my food away and then refuse to give me my money back after I only ate about 20% of the food They were actually rather nasty and offered to make me another order but I already spent over 30 minutes there what a waste of my time and moneyExtremely poor customer serviceBye
12/12/2020,4,"Bento is a great place for a consistent meal at a reasonable price. My staple is their poke bowl, which you can get in multiple sizes depending on how hungry you are. You get quite a bit of food for the money, even at the smaller sizes. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious. I also occasionally go off the sushi menu and have always had a good experience there as well.More often than not, I order Bento for delivery. It's only every once in a while I go to dine-in. The restaurant is clean and the service is always quick. I've been impressed with the measures they've taken since COVID to ensure customers are safe with changing the flow of the order/pay line and keeping people outside for as much of the process as possible.Good sushi. Good poke. Good prices. Can't go wrong."
3/8/2019,3,Pros: chicken quality was good. Large pieces of white meat. Quantity was filling. With the bento box you got to try a variety of things. Cons: Worst Boba tea I've had. Very sweet and boba was soggy. Chicken wasn't crispy but I think it was tempura cooked so that is simply a matter of preference.
10/19/2021,2,Really gross steak. Don't pay extra for it. Only four pieces were edible (two of which were really tiny). Then there were two giant fatty clumps of meat that were inedible. Quality has really declined. Basically paid $15 for rice and vegetables.
2/9/2021,5,"I'm Bentos number one fan! I order my lunch here almost everyday. Their food is outstanding and customer service is out of this world. I order fried avo roll and add cream cheese every time. I've had meetings here, brought visiting friends and family, ordered in, ordered take out. Like I said.... number one fan."
3/20/2022,1,I waited 45 min for a mobile order to be ready at 9:30pm. They close at 10 and I was still waiting by 10:15pm. Slowest location ever!
3/15/2022,1,This place is an over priced sushi place. If you want authentic sushi do not go here. The menu is super limited the chick with reddish purple hair is super rude. They don't offer cash payments and that is very inconvenient. When I asked about the no cash the woman with the hair didn't even look up and rudely said they don't carry cash because of Covid and they don't want to get robbed. That is hysterical. Don't go here if you don't want a bunch of 19 year blonde white girls making your sushi. There is a place right behind it called Thai place go there. Not to mention I open my food and there is barely any wasabi.. and it's discolored and the miso soup I got doesn't have any tofu just mushrooms.. this is rediculous
4/4/2021,1,"I watched the girl put in chocolate powder in the cup after me asking for taro and after telling her it's chocolate she says ""it's taro it just doesn't have a lot of dye in it ""?? Wtf . Maybe they need to start drug testing the employees cuz this happens more often than not at this location ."
9/15/2020,5,Pretty delicious!!! And great deals!!! I got the sushi combo box... omg you have to try the mexican roll. And the employees were SO KIND and welcoming. They gave us free water bottles bc their machine was down. What other place would do that?Def recommend.
3/4/2022,1,I place a mobile order (2 sushi rolls) at 11am when they opened. Arrived at 11:15 and over 15 (dine in and carry out)  customer orders were brought out before mine. When I asked about my order two people behind the counter were quite rude about it. I come in twice a week for lunch and will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.
9/14/2020,5,One of my favorite spots in Winter Park! Large variety of options! Definitely recommend this place.
7/15/2020,5,I have been going to Bento sushi for years. They originally out of the Gainesville area and they have a reputation for great quick service sushi. I particularly like their combo box where I can pick two rolls and they do not charge me for brown rice. They are also taking very special attention to the Covid situation and they close their dining room on their own choice to help prevent the spread. Love Bento and I've been going for years.
8/20/2021,1,"Always ""temporarily closing"" for online orders.  Hire more staff to keep up with demand.  The quality is not good either. Probably because the have cheap management and owners."
7/1/2019,4,"This was the first visit for the Bento location after having been to the Sand Lake location a few times. This one is wayyyyyy cleaner so that was definitely a plus. It's also newer but I hope they will keep that up. Our sushi specials were fresh and tasty! My daughter and I are tea fans as well so we grabbed some boba and Thai iced tea as well. Portions are large and we like to do a little sharing which works out perfectly. Easy, fresh, and tasty. Perfect."
9/4/2020,3,"I ordered a rainbow roll and made my own mini poké bowl. You can order sushi rolls to be either 4 pieces or 8. I did the 8. The roll itself was yummy. I really enjoyed it, tasted fresh and the size of each roll was nice. The poké on the other hand, not so great. I ordered it with white rice, tuna, red onion, cucumber, avocado, sweet chili and masago. The tuna tasted weird and it's texture was just odd. Never experienced that before and I love tuna. Didn't taste that fresh which was disappointing and a little concerning. The sweet chili sauce was just ok. The red onions weren't sliced all the way and were left with the head of the onion. Yuck. I would only resort to sushi from this place. Staying away from the poké :("
7/28/2019,3,I just tried the Hawaiian Poke Bowl.  It looks pretty but it was ok.  It's more of a rice dish than Poke.  They put too much rice and less Tuna.  The mango is a nice touch.
8/30/2019,4,Bento Asian kitchen was pretty good I was impressed with crunchy role but the pork dumplings could definitely use some work. They just didn't have a lot of flavor. This is one of the better sushi like places in the area though so I'll be back but I do wish there were more traditional roles.
6/8/2020,5,"This is my absolute FAVORITE place. The customizable poke bowls are so worth it and delicious! I get Bento all the time and I'm always satisfied. They have great prices for the poke bowls considering that the QUALITY is top notch. Especially the salmon, tuna, and everything is just so fresh. I'm happy that I discovered this place and after my first time, I was hooked. Now going two or three weeks without Bento feels like foreverrr. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I always like playing around with the combinations of the poke bowl and the way I get it is like eating sushi but in a bowl  I love Bento!"
4/18/2019,3,"Updated review now that I was able to sit and eat.They still only had 1 person taking orders which was peculiar considering the line started growing rapidly after we ordered and I didn't see anyone else go up front. So, this issue is still ongoing. We ordered the Mexican Roll, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Katsu. All 3 tasted great, no complaints. However, they don't have any options for tea, which was odd.. husband usually orders tea at the other location so FYI. Overall it's an OK option for a semi-quick eat if you're in the area. ----------------------------------------I didn't get to actually sit and eat. This review is purely on entering during dinner rush hour. When we entered the restaurant the line was probably 20 people long. I noticed only one person was taking orders. I thought, no way they'll just leave her alone with this sudden rush. Ten minutes in line, only 2 people had been helped and I had to go. I will try to come back when it's a slower time of the day and review on food. Hop"
10/26/2019,2,"Took over 30 minutes to get my to go order for poke, they gave me a ginger salad to compensate. Normally, I am a super understanding person because I've been on the other side, but when they take forever to make your order and then get it wrong? I asked for mango and got pineapples instead. Luckily I'm not allergic to pineapple. And yes I probably should have checked my order before leaving but I was already waiting on the cusp of 40 minutes.Food tastes fine minus the pineapples. Jasmine milk tea was flavorful and boba were nice and chewy. I'm just really disappointed because this my first visit here after a lot of my coworkers recommended it to me. :(Just some advice, please try to pay closer attention to your orders. Probably won't be returning for a while."
4/9/2019,5,Stopped her for lunch ! Yummm! The menu is great and has a wide variety. I was low carb so I stuck with the create your own poke bowl! The bowl was so fresh and delicious. The tuna and salmon was fresh. The service was so fast! They also have warm bowls like chicken teriyaki and noodle bowls. They have sushi and boba tea. I tried the mango green tea! It was amazing! Not too sweet at all! I can't wait to go back and try some rolls and hot food! Pricing isn't bad for the amount of food that you get. I would like to be able to choose more toppings for the build your own but other than that no complaints. Great lunch place!
1/31/2019,5,"Five stars for a much needed Bento in the Winter Park area! I complete majority of my shopping and errands in this area. By the end of it, a girl is in serious need of some good lunch. I absolutely enjoy the Bento Box. You get the best of many worlds by ordering it. The amount and variety of food included in the box is genius and such perfection! My mouth is watering as I type this lol. The creamy chicken tastes unique and leaves me wanting more. I believe they call it the pao pao chicken if I am not mistaken. I also like to order their miso soup."
2/16/2020,4,"Didn't think the food would be good, but man I was wrong. Their chicken fried rice is simple and tasty without being overkill on flavor or texture. Everything tasted fresh and was made to order so that's cool. I just really wish they'd have more ramen options, it's so hard to find quick and cheap ramen options without going to a fancier restaurant. I also really wish they'd be a little quicker with cleaning the tables. There was a rush and it seemed like empty but when we tried to sit at the tables it seemed like every other one was dirty and just needed to be wiped down. Otherwise the restaurant was nice and quiet for the most part and clean."
12/12/2018,5,"So grateful for Bento joining Winter Park! They couldn't have selected a better location.. Nestled right on Lee Rd and Orlando ave. Recently remolded plaza with a new modern feel. Tons of new businesses just opened with more to come. Bento never goes wrong with design both interior and exterior, just a pleasant atmosphere all around. I simply cannot wait for their outdoor patio to be completed. Their menu has something for everyone and the food is just absolutely cooked to perfection every time. Simply no complaints or nothing I would change. Been here twice already for lunch. Customer service is on level 100 for sure.. plenty of parking and seating all around. I recently ordered the Spicy Bulgogi  bento box and so happy that I did. Got a little of everything as pictured below. The beef was thinly sliced and very flavorful. Oh and their lo mein is phenomenal!"
2/28/2021,5,Went here for the 1st time since it has opened almost a year ago. It lived up to the hype. The sushi was top notch. We ordered online and it was ready well before expected. Staff was friendly when we walked in to claim our order. I would love to dine in once Covid is more under control. No complaints about the food at all!
9/7/2019,5,"Walk into this restaurant, just WOW. I love the look of it, super modern. Also you can watch the employees make sushi from a little observation area, by the soda fountain.Me, my mom, and my dad each ordered Poke bowl, and they were absolutely scrumptious(photos attached)! Special thanks to the staff for such fast and efficient service.Overall, this Bento visit was unlike any other, and a huge recommendation for sushi lovers and beyond."
1/6/2019,4,"I did take out and got the sushi combo which comes with California roll and half portion of 2 classic rolls for $11 and it comes with a side salad and some sort of pickled red cabbage. The rolls I got was the shrimp tempura without masago or cream cheese and the spicy tuna without spicy mayo. Both these rolls and the Cali roll was delicious and well made. A lot of places put too much rice but this place had the perfect amount. The snags with my order is that the cashier overcharged me and couldn't figure out how to fix it, she was attempting to refund me from the tip jar but I didn't feel right about that so I told them it was ok. When u got home I noticed the salad had no dressing so basically it was just lettuce and carrot. I also could have done without the purple cabbage, it didn't really complement the meal. I'd definitely go back and try the bowls or the other bento boxes."
3/4/2021,5,"Reliable and high quality eastern cuisine! a favorite of mine is the curry, and they have great procedures for covid"
11/25/2019,1,So how does a place that serves ASIAN food and half of their menu is SUSHI  have a 20 minute wait on Sushi on a MONDAY night and have a full staff in the restaurant for dine in. Wow how crappy won't be coming here anymore.
2/9/2020,5,I'm not sure if Bento is a chain but with my first experience  I was not disappointed. I had the Chicken Pad Thai and I found the dish to be fairly flavorful. The portions offered was good and the price point was  affordable  at 10 dollars. This place also offers Poke bowls and a few bubble tea drinks. The place had a modern contemporary feel inside and would definitely  recommend this place  for a quick lunch or dinner place.
10/17/2019,2,"I had a very jarring last experience at this location. I had placed a phone order so as to save time on the way to work. Nicole, who had taken the order, was very abrasive and irate off the bat. She continually cut me off during the order and made it very apparent that she was annoyed taking the order. Setting this as the tone made it feel as though as I was inconveniencing her and her time. Normally I would brush this off and not have this bother me, but the icing on the cake was that the order was wrong. I had ordered the chicken curry Katsu and had received the traditional chicken katsu with just the Japanese bbq. The unprofessionalism displayed here and the incompetence in taking orders is too cumbersome to overlook. I hope that the energy given off by Nicole isn't the same energy given off by the rest of the staff."
8/17/2019,4,Good place to grab a decent meal :) I tried their pad thai my last visit and it wasn't bad! On the spicier side for sure.
2/23/2019,1,"Go somewhere that cares about you as a customer. Orlando has some brilliant restaurants. I'm appalled at the disrespect of the Manager at this establishment. My family and I have been eating here since it opened. Like any restaurant with a high flow we expect issues here and there no problem. Tonight though was ridiculous. We tried a Green Tea with Pineapple. The menu says Green Tea. We got a Jasmine Green Tea. My wife is allergic to Jasmine. When I asked about it, I was cut off mid sentence with ""Our cross contagion policy"". No, I'm sorry. No, it's a 3.50 drink what can I do to help make you feel better. Just it's your fault. We spent on average 40 dollars a meal here. After telling the manager that her leadership and management skills were lacking and I was highly offended, I advised her we were never returning and it was her conversation that did it."
12/5/2019,4,"Went here with my husband. I got the garlic broccoli rice bowl with chicken very good..I tried to use a coupon on Yelp for a free appetizer didn't realize till the manager came and looked that this was for the downtown location.Was hoping that the manager would maybe still honor it since I already accepted the coupon and now I will lose the coupon but she did not. That is why I didn't do a five star review. Food was so good. Definitely be back to try more dishes, just wished they would have honored the free appetizer coupon."
9/8/2019,5,"Bento has a special place in my heart, it's one of my favorite food spots in Orlando and I'm constantly craving it. Literally everything on the menu is so good and will not disappoint. The staff is already friendly and fast. I take all of my friends and family here and always recommend it! Please go!"
8/8/2019,5,"I love Bento. My first experience with the Asian Kitchen was years ago at their Gainesville location. They've since expanded to have 2 locations - one downtown and one in winter park. Downtown has a slightly swankier sushi bar vibe, and winter Park is a very approachable quick service spot ideal for lunch or dinner on the go. The sushi menu includes a decent selection including a number of classic basic rolls (your rainbow, California, and spicy tunas) as well as signature rolls (I like the Hot Lava). For sides go for the garlic edamame - so good! My pick for entrees comes from the ""From the kitchen"" section - here you pick an base entree (Mongolian beef, Korean chicken, etc) and have it served in either a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. My favorite combo is a Pao Pao Chicken noodle bowl (I always pick udon noodles, but lo mein and ramen are also on offer). Bestie gets the build-a-poke bowl because he believes in healthy eating - boooooring! Enjoy!"
8/28/2020,3,I entered the Resturant and I was not sure where to go. I finally figured out where to order. I placed my order and got the Mongolian bowl with lo me in noodles. The food was hot and fresh.However no salt or pepper was at the table and the server looked confused when I asked for it. Taste is everything for me. Brandy is an awesome server. She deserves a raise. She was so helpful. Since it was my first time here she made it easy for me to order.
5/15/2019,5,Amazing food and super fresh. Portions are large. The menu is big with so many options to chose from. We will definitely be going back!
1/28/2019,2,"This review is based on a to-go order. I brought a meal home for my wife and I and everything seemed to be...sloppy, at least for me. My wife loved her presentation of her Bento box, but she could only enjoy half of it because the rice didn't seem to be cooked all of the way through. She only ate the protein and some greens. I ordered a salad with some Umi and I got chicken instead. I will give this place another chance in the future and may dine in to give it a better chance because, dining in and taking out can be two completely different experiences."
2/2/2019,3,"I had a chance to check this place out on a Saturday night. My neighbor had been recommending this V.S my favorite Asian fast-food. Well, I did not have a high expectation but It's kinda disappointing. I went here with my toddler, and I asked a younger guy with glasses on if he can help me with a high chair, I told him where I was seated, he said he would. I finished my order and I had to ask a lady at the counter again. While I have no age favoritism I felt that the younger people who works here are less helpful. OK that was the first impression. I ordered their limited time Spicy Pork Miso Ramen,  a taro boba , and a kids meal for my toddler and they were another disappointment. Being an Asian and maybe it was how I was brought up, I hate to waste food. BUT there's an exception. If I won't eat the food I'd bring home I rather not bring it home and that's what happened. The Ramen portion was big but the pork had a not-fresh after taste and 'Gawd' the soup was very salty. If soup was meant to be a salt broth then I'd rather not have it again- But I know it's not suppose to be that way. The chicken in the kids bento was kinda hard to chew on, tasted a little bit salty too considering it's for a child. The only thing I finished was the taro bobba, I admit it was good. Also I want to add that this place is not a family or child friendly place. Youngster Staff in the dining area raised eyebrows on my cheerful toddler. Nope. Not recommended."
6/1/2019,5,"Bento is by far the best local sushi restaurant chain in the area. The Winter Park location is great and convenient, with a decent amount of parking and good service.My Bento go to will always be the sushi combo box -- really a great deal for a good amount of food. Comes with a salad, vegetable, 8 pc california roll and your choice of 2 rolls to add. Highly recommend the Special Mex roll! And get spicy mayo as your special sauce to add - YUM! When I don't order my usual, I love the Pao Pao spicy cream chicken with rice, and the poke bowls are customizable and delicious as well. This location also has bubble tea so be sure to ask for a bubble tea punch card . Buy 8 and get your 9th tea FREE! If you're looking for your next restaurant obsession TRY BENTO! You won't be disappointed."
5/6/2019,4,"So happy there's another location aside from Dr Phillips and downtown. Even during the busy lunch rush food is exactly as I expect. Love the ""creamy Siracha chicken."""
5/19/2019,5,"I love the fried dumplings, the white sauce, and the sriracha garlic chicken. Everything I have had here has been excellent! Just wish they had brewed tea along with the fountain drinks (instead of the bottled tea...cuz I get thirsty lol)."
9/3/2019,5,Food is delicious the staff wasFriendly the 2 times I e been there we have enjoyed our food  and the staff was smiling and seemed genuinely sweetgood prices too cheaper than the place I used to go and tastes better (jade off Edgewater)
8/31/2020,1,"I ordered a stir fry bento box from this location through Postmates, my food arrived cold and I mean cold like it had been sitting out for quite some time. The chicken was over cooked and dry and my boba tea tasted rancid, possibly from the milk since it was a milk tea option. I was given a $2.00 credit through Postmates. Never again. I spent about $25 on this entire order."
5/20/2019,3,"The bento boxes are awesome, the bowls are a lot of food but very tasty.... today is the first time I'm trying their sushi.... it's easy to grab and go or sit and eat with a grp, casual dining. The sushi looks beautiful for a counter service type of restaurant they spend the time to make it look and taste great. Tried the caliente and the bamboo roll, my friend had the tnt and the spicy salmon. Our other friends order was messed up and although the bento boxes and bowls are great some of the sushi rolls weren't rolled well and fell apart right away."
1/5/2019,5,"Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Order at the counter and they bring food to you. Sushi is great-nothing super fancy but very fresh and well prepared. I love the bento box style of eating so you get a number of different items. My wife and I split a sushi box (8 pieces of California roll and two different 4 piece rolls) with salad and a hot entree box. The noodles, salad, little desert are perfect. We got the garlic broccoli chicken and it was delish!The kids meal box is a lot of food for a great price. My two kiddos split the box and it was plenty of food!"
2/6/2020,4,"I was meeting a friend here at Bento Winter Park location.  She came early so she ordered for me already.  When I got there my bento box was already on the table.  I ordered  fried tofu with Korean cooking style.  Overall it wasn't as good as tofu with Sichuan cooking style I had at  UCF location.  The sauce wasn't savory and had too much oil in the cooking.  It's really filling with ginger salad, green bean and the Lomein on the side.  Luckily my friend got me some sweet chilly sauce and that was flavorful.  I dipped everything in that sauce and finished the box.  My friend ordered a poke bowl and she finished hers before I got there.  If I come back here I will order Sichuan cooking style."
1/11/2020,3,Charcoal chicken. Very over cooked and burned for the chicken teriyaki. Just white rice and dry burned chicken with a few green beans. The noodle bowls were better and the sushi was tasty.  Next time I'll get a bento box. The bubble tea tasted like perfume.
11/20/2018,5,"I have always been a fan of Bento Cafe. I usually went to their downtown and Sand Lake Road locations. I went here on their soft opening to try out their usual dishes. I ordered the Pao Pao Spice Cream chicken with Lo Mein noodles. It tastes the same great quality as their other restaurants. I'm glad they open this location. Downtown can be tedious to go sometimes since it can be very busy and parking in the garage takes time. This Winter Park location has great parking and still have fast service. Definitely would like to come again and try their pokè bowls. I still haven't tried it. For a soft opening, the service and food was great."
5/3/2019,3,"Good food, like always.  But ... this location needs to work on their delivery. I was there yesterday around 6:15 pm.  After 15 minutes, my sushi arrived. Then another 10 before my granddaughter received her California Roll, 10 minutes later she got her miso soup ... all while my grandson waited for his udon soup.  A full 40 minutes went by waiting. Meanwhile they served more than 8 other tables that not only arrived and ordered after us, but those tables finished and left. And still we waited. I went up after the first 25 to find out where The udon soup was and received the answer of we're really busy.  Not a good excuse. That only works if the other 8 tables were waiting. Do I think they didn't know how to run the orders? You bet. Disorganized, slow kitchen, no excuse.  Get it together or you will start to lose business"
5/27/2020,5,"I tried this place today for lunch.  My first poke bowl ever! I have to say thatI was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something quick to eat, and came across Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi.  The place was well frequented by customers. Nicely decorated, with friendly staff. I ordered the small poke bowl, for which I picked white rice, breaded chicken for the main entree.  It came with up to 5 toppings, which I picked cream cheese, mango, wonton chips, avocado, and something else I can't remember! :) Came with two sauces, I picked spicy mayo and garlic one.   I have to say it was filling, very fresh, and very tasty! Good size too even though it was small.  The price was very reasonable at $7.50.  They have medium and bigger sizes too, and a whole array of sushi rolls for sushi aficionados!  Would definitely try other dishes in the future when in the area. Would recommend!"
1/18/2019,5,"My boyfriend and I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened in Nov. I have tried something different each time and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every dish. I still haven't figured out a favorite but I'm leaning towards the Sesame Tofu rice bowl. The tofu here is so good, being vegan I normally have to suffer through ultra plain and boring tofu as a protein substitute but this place does it right. The sauces are always coated thoroughly and make  it so flavorful.Staff are pleasant and attentive :)"
9/28/2021,2,"I've purchased take out from this restaurant several times.  Generally the food has been fresh and tasty. However, the past 3 times I've been pretty disappointed with the quality, specifically the fish.  Each time I've ordered a Poke Bowl with Tuna and each time the Tuna was on the edge of going bad.     It's been dull pink, mushy and fishy tasting.  Also, when ordering online, they have a great feature to save your order so you can simply duplicate the order.  However, they change their menu so often, you can't really duplicate it.  It's simple things too - they used to offer several sizes of Poke Bowls - Small, Medium and Large (with 3 proteins) Now, there's Kids and Regular.  You used to be able to get Tofu as a protein option or Brown Rice instead of sushi rice, now they're both gone, but they still offer them on other menu items.  It's these things that changes the impression of a restaurant, and has us second guessing for our next to-go orders."
1/12/2019,4,I only had edamame and steamed dumplings but they were good. The edamame was not overly salty and came as a large helping.The steamed dumplings had good flavor and a good portion of meaty yum!.I have not been here since 98. I know it's a different setup but just as I remember flavor wise.
2/15/2020,4,We frequent this place often because I know I can count on delicious food fast. My family and I have never been disappointed! The food is excellent value. The only thing that makes me nuts is how uncomfortably cold they keep this place. Please turn the AC down!
3/9/2019,1,"My first and last time coming to this restaurant.  I ordered viet porkchop bento box... I only ate couple pieces of the pork and finished the noodles, fried crispy noodles and salad.  After about 10 mins! I rushed to the toilet Diarrhea ! I felt soooo nausea too... I basically trashed my meal after what happened to me! The fried noodle wrapper tasted-bitter and oilly, perhaps they re used the old oil? Maybe that got me sick? Maybe it was the salad got me sick?The pork chop was deep fried too, and I could immediately tell they used too much meat tenderizer or baking soda... the meat had no texture too soft... very disappointed! I tried it and disappointed."
3/3/2020,4,"I was looking for a place like this for a while, usually sushi is very expensive and the price in bento are very favorable, my only concern was that it take a very long time to get the order ready, we are talking about 20-25 minutes, the cashier explained that they have a lot of internet orders and that is why, any way the food was amazing"
3/2/2019,5,"I love the DT Orlando location, so I was glad this location opened in November. It's fast-casual and you can get 4 piece classic rolls for $3.50-$4.50. Prices are reasonable and the service has always been great. I've ordered on DoorDash and UberEats and they are always quick to prepare the order, unlike many other sushi places in the winter park area."
8/8/2019,5,"So when I walked in I thought I was going to leave unsatisfied and hungry since this place looks like an average fast food restaurant that sells Asian food. Well... this place was amazing! Huge rice bowls and the sushi rolls are very big as well and very little rice, with lots of seafood! We came during happy hour so it was definitely worth it, you get an extra roll when you buy two rolls and a soup or salad when you buy an entree. I loved it, will definitely be back!"
5/13/2019,5,"Good food, always a favorite lunch spot in winter park. Quick and easy if you don't have time for a long lunch. Also travels well to go if you can't stay."
8/5/2019,4,"Bento is a family favorite! And the Winter Park location never fails us! My husband and son LOVE their Pao Pao Chicken and rice and I love their bento boxes, sushi and noodle bowls. Everything is always so fresh and delicious. The only thing I haven't had a great run with is their teas. I've tried two different flavors (both recommended by employees) and ended up not liking them at all. Maybe those teas are not my thing? I may try one more next time. But overall a great place to get your Asian/Bento fix. Not bad for a food chain! Clean, spacious atmosphere and good customer service."
4/18/2019,4,"Ordered the Korean Steak Bento Box, Orange Chicken Rice Bowl. And Kids Teriyaki Box. Food looked and tasted good. They even have ramune soda and Sapporo beer Definitely will come back!"
5/21/2019,3,"Sushi tasted good (not the best I've had, but not bad as well). They messed up my order, but I was frustrated and didn't request my correct order. Hey did offer free sala or soup while I waited for my order though."
9/17/2019,1,"After recieving the company's comment, I emailed to have not recieved any emails or communication back from them. Not only poor customer service, terrible food but owners who dont care to respond when they ask you to reach out"
7/27/2019,4,I was surprised my the quality of the food. I ordered a Bento box with the shrimp tempura. The food was super fresh and they got the line down in no time. The line stayed out the door the whole time. Now I know why - great food
9/23/2020,5,"This place is delicious, love it and have tried it many times.  My only complaint would be their avocado portion is minimal but otherwise, flavors are there and service was always exceptional.  Would definitely recommend."
10/18/2020,1,Terrible communication and timing. They said it would take 50 min to prep and receive food. Waiting over 1.5 hours now. Order from somewhere else if you want to receive your food before midnight
5/3/2020,5,Ordered for pickup. Perfectly & quickly pulled together our order. Very clean & beautiful presentation-even in takeaway containers. Everything was very fresh. We were very pleased & will definitely order from them again.
5/18/2019,4,"If you're looking for a quick Asian meal this is a good place to check out. They offer bento boxes, rice bowl, poke and sushi. The wait was 10-15 minutes if you're dining in which isn't bad. I had the red curry bento box and it was pretty good. If I'm ever in the mood for a quick Asian bite I'd come pay them a visit."
4/20/2019,1,They ran out of tofu which left us with no options. Didnt apologize at all. Wont go back.
5/11/2019,5,Food was hot and delicious and staff were very polite. Restaurant and patrons were very clean. I was a bit upset that they didn't have the pork ramen but I understand that it's a seasonal item. I opted for the bento box which was a decent amount of food. I also got a Lychee soda that had a marble inside. Apparently it's some kind of Japanese drink. It was quite interesting.
9/11/2019,1,"Horrible service! Food is not like any other Bento I've ever been to!The first 2 times I ate the bowls here, I had to throw them away; the sauce was pasty and thick. The 3rd time, the sushi tasted bad. The 4th time, our order was messed up and the ""replacement"" was not what we paid for. I will never return to this location again. Just plain terrible!"
4/15/2019,3,"I like the food but the service is okay! We usually order and the kids taking order either don't get it correct or forget and ask multiple times. My BIGGEST negative is that despite phone order to pick up, one has to wait in line to pick it up. What's the point of ordering 20 min ahead? Your location is busy so just make a separate counter for pick-up!"
8/28/2019,5,Nice place in the winter park area. Stopped in for a small dinner and enjoyed every bit of my food. I would like to try other menu Items next time. So many things sounded so good on the menu. Great for lunch or a quick dinner.
4/27/2019,4,"Bento was a very pleasant surprise for us! We had never been to one before...the meats were all excellent - tender, juicy and not fatty. The noodles, rice, & sides were done right and quite tasty! The garlic edamame was addictive (please note - it is very garlicky!) and I can't wait to get more of that! Taking our orders was a little slow as they only had 1 person doing so with 10-15 people in line. However, the care by the runners was excellent and better than I would expect from an order at the counter restaurant."
3/14/2019,1,Warning if you are a vegetarian. They cook their tofu in the same grease as their meat. Couldn't get a hot meal with tofu because of this. Very disappointed.
1/11/2019,5,Bento is seriously the best sushi deal in town. It's delicious and affordable and always good!
1/9/2019,5,My first time here and I want to come back. I had a noodle bowl and it was delicious. My buddies tried other dishes and they liked them too.
3/2/2019,1,"We have been going to the downtown location for almost 10 years and have never had a bad experience so we were extremely excited when this (closer to home) location opened. What a disappointment!!! It felt way too much like fast food. We had to stand in line to order (unlike downtown where you sit down and have a server) then our food came out piece meal. The garlic edamame tasted like burnt garlic and by the time we got our sushi, it was cold (we always order rolls that come with hot/warm toppings-volcano roll, etc). We will never go back to this location. From now on, we will only go the the downtown location."
3/24/2019,5,"This is my fave quick sushi spot. They allow you to do half rolls , which most places won't let you do this. This allows you to experiment with new tastes and fish. This is my go to sushi spot."
11/11/2019,5,"Can't go wrong here! Consistently good and I just ordered take out this time and the food is soo freaking hot it's unbelievable! I came home and left the bag sitting for at least 30 min while I was cleaning around / messing with the dogs and when I finally sat to eat, the food was still steaming! Five stars just for that"
12/20/2018,2,"Just another overpriced, underwhelming, fast casual restaurant. Cheap napkins, plastic flatware - at this price point? Another reviewer mentioned being nickel and dimed to death - it's true. Food was ok, but there are much better choices out there."
2/6/2019,5,"Nicole and Jervane were both amazing when it came to ordering. I placed a togo order and my card caused their system to glitch. They quickly remedied the situation to provide an overall great experience. Teamwork like that makes me happy to visit this Bento until the E. Colonial one opens up! Besides the service, the food was AMAZING as always!"
12/30/2018,5,"Lovvvvvve this new Asian spot! I tried it twice - first time I got chicken pad Thai and the second I got the Orange Chicken bento box. Both were delicious and perfectly portioned. It's cool that there's a place where I can get Chinese, Japanese, and Thai food all in one, including boba tea - the Thai tea is AMAZING by the way!Make sure to try this place - probably my next go-to for quick sushi!"
8/21/2019,3,"Pretty good and fairly affordable.  Been here twice.  Today however,  not so happy.  Ordered from their regular menu, 2 - Hawaiian bowls.  It is 1:20PM on a Wednesday......out of lettuce, they have enough 1 bowl.  Really? Lunch crowd and out of primary ingredients.  They offered to use 1/2 portions in each.  I asked to the balance of the shortage made up with  other vegetables and fruit (not asking for double tuna).  Denied. Offered noodles or rice, which is what we were trying to avoid.  Long story short.  They were kind enough the refund price of one bowl, making 1.  BUT, they kept the full 15% tip from the complete order.  Shows a level of short sightedness and poor customer service I hope doesn't transfer into their food which usually good."
2/28/2019,1,"Service has attitude problems. Food is greasy. Also, the vegetables look and taste like the ones you buy frozen at the grocery store. It definitely isn't fresh. I don't recommend this place."
1/1/2019,5,I have been going to the UCF location for a while now and very happy they opened a Winter Park location which is closer to me. Very elegant and simple decor and prompt service. Tried rice with Thai red curry sauce and spring rolls with miso soup. Everything tasted great. Others I my group tried the Mangolian and spicy Korean dishes. Additional sauces are great because I like my dishes a bit soggy. Would visit again and highly recommend this place.
4/29/2019,2,No one has a smile on their face working here and they ran out of a lot of food. Not good customer service.
8/23/2019,3,Overall a good place to eat at. Only concern is different meals coming out at different times even though it was on one tab.
4/24/2019,5,Regularly go here for sushi and Japanese food. I recommend the pao pao chicken noodle bowl and the special Mexican roll!  Very good! Fresh!
6/3/2019,5,This is like a upscale fast food restaurant. They have a good selection for sushi and food from the kitchen. They do have happy hour for sushi which I have not had yet but I was told that they do. They have poke bowls as well. The food is fresh and tastes great! This is a good spot for when your craving good sushi or just good Asian food. They also have more than one location.
2/22/2019,5,"Came back tonight...portion sizes were good/right again, and everything delicious.  WOOT WOOT!!!"
12/10/2018,3,"There are multiple locations but I will say the one on orange ave downtown is by far the best one! They not only nickel and dime you for everything @ this location (sauces, sushi toppings, etc) the food quality and taste are probably at most a 4/10."
1/24/2019,5,Themis place was awesome!  The restaurant itself was clean and well kept. Ordering was easy and quick. I was ordering take out and my food was brought to me within a few minutes. It was during the lunchtime rush which made it even better. The menu was easy to understand with many options. The food was exceptional. I will definitely be back!
1/26/2019,4,"I typically go for the Hawaiian poke bowl. Fresh and tasty! The only reason for 4 stars is that they haven't quite got the ordering down. Sometimes they try to charge me for ponzu sauce, other times they just give it to me for free. ???"
9/5/2022,5,"Quick easy Asian food at a decent price.  We go to the one on 13th.  Always clean, always busy, always good food."
11/5/2021,4,Great lunch and friendly service. Fast casual Asian with a big menu including creat your own bowl or poke. Tried a poke bowl with spicy tuna and the miso soup. The soup was spot on and yummy. The bowl was good and toppings were fresh. Staff was friendly and courteous. You order at the counter and then they bring it to you. #eatatbento $$
11/5/2021,1,"I come to Bento just starving before studying for an exam, and I order a orange chicken meal. I barely have time to look at my food as I'm preparing to work but as I look down, I am mortified. Orange chicken, more like PINK chicken. My chicken is raw with minimal streaks of white meat. I can't even return it anymore because it's too late and I'll just have to starve tonight. I'm feeling the salmonella particles pile in my stomach and I'm extremely disappointed in this bento."
3/8/2021,5,"Ordered Ubereats to my officeDelivered in minutes by a courteous  runner. Zen Garden roll, a vegetarian and delicious option with crunchy tofu and explosion of flavors melting on your  mouth Hawaiian bowl with marinated tuna and mango delicious and fulfilling"
8/30/2022,3,Great for a quick dinner. The rice bowls and noodle bowls are GENEROUS in size. If you are a fish lover/sushi lover... this is NOT the place for you.The service makes up for everything. Everyone was super nice and helpful.
8/15/2022,1,"Worst place to eat in Gainesville. If you order be prepared to watch 15 more people come in and order then get their food before you. Also, they delete negative reviews."
10/25/2022,3,"Food is always good, but it's super overpriced and the staff here are slow and not very friendly."
8/24/2022,1,My friend got horrible food poisoning from the sushi at this place. She was so ill for days and visibly looked unwell for hours after consuming the food.
5/11/2022,3,Sub par pan Asian but still love going to the Archer n newberry location more often. I think they could do a better job at the sushi component
4/11/2022,5,"Never have any thing less than a great experience at this Bento. I am always greeted with a smile and warm welcome as I enter. The employees are extremely patient and do not make you feel rush or pressured in any way. They will bring your food to your table if you wish to stay, and food comes out pretty quick for the amount of business they receive. The tables are always clean and the booths are very comfortable. The food comes out hot and well-prepared, with soy sauce and other common necessities at the table. I can confidently say that the Miami Roll or the Vegetable Udon Noodle Bowl are two of the best meals I've ever had. They also have a fountain soda machine offering free refills with many options. All around, one of my favorite places to eat in Gainesville, can't ever see them going wrong!"
10/21/2020,4,"I was near this location for a meeting and wanted a quick lunch. Bento is predictable and this meal fit the bill. I ordered online, did not modify my food, and I was happy with the outcome. I had the TNT roll, Chicken Tempura roll, and a ginger salad. It was a good amount of food. The quality of the sushi is a step below Volcanic and other better places.The food was ready at the requested time (I ordered ahead) and the location seemed very clean when I walked in. Napkins and chopsticks were already in the back, which was convenient, so I grabbed it and took off."
2/17/2019,4,"For quick pan-asian food with a varied menu and decent prices, Bento is a great option, especially for lunch.I was really impressed with the cleanliness od the restaurant and the wonderful cashier who took my order. I was quite indecisive about my selection, so the cashier asked me what I had a taste for, if I liked spicy foods, and he even told me his own personal favorites. And his suggestion was spot on--the red curry katsu pork. I ordered it over white rice. The curry sauce comes on the side so you can spread it on your dish to your liking. If you like panko breading, then this dish is for you.The orange chicken was deliciously crispy and flavorful. You get a huge portion, so the lunch size was more than enough.Service was quick, staff were friendly, and I'll definitely be returning"
5/20/2022,5,"Amazing. Food is so fresh and yummy! One dish came out a little late, but they are so kind and brought it right out."
5/5/2020,3,"I want to love Bento. But I can't. Dining in is a pretty decent experience. Delivery is where it all falls apart. Of all the times I've ordered delivery, now more than ever,it's been correct 25% of the time. I'm not sure if this happens to anyone else, but for my protein for my sesame rice bowl I order tofu and extra protein because I'd like more tofu. Somehow either that means tofu and chicken or just chicken.This attention to detail isn't a one time thing. This has happened so much that it's not even something I want to or have time to deal with.I really want to support them being a Gainesville restaurant, but I find it difficult to do this when they can't get my main protein correct more times I can count."
3/23/2020,5,Ordered on Postmates and it was great! Usually get sushi-2-go but will be going here now. Prices were fair and packaging was nice too with no spills.
9/18/2021,1,"I ordered off Uber Eats so the temperature and presentation may not be exactly like the restaurant, but the taste doesn't change. I ordered the orange chicken with noodles (I also payed extra for shrimp) and the veggie stir fry rice bowl. I have to admit that the orange chicken was delicious, but the noodles were ok and they did NOT include the shrimp I payed extra for! The veggie stir fry was extremely amateur: the rice was that nice sticky consistency but bland tasting, the veggies were unseasoned and tasteless, and I barely received any chicken like it said it would include. The only flavor in the rice bowl was the sauce which is pathetic. I was originally going to give 2 stars until I realized the shrimp was missing like wow. Never ordering from there again, I'd rather walk across the street to Publix and eat the raw chicken."
3/26/2020,4,Best Asian food in Gainesville. The place was crowded when I went there  at 1pm but it depends on the time. The staff prepared my food quickly.I ordered the best Sushi I've ever had in Gainesville. The place was soo nice and not that expensive.
3/4/2019,3,"With a new location across from UF Campus, this Bento is just a few steps away from Heavener Hall and underneath the Standard. In regards to food and service, it echoes the quality of other Bento locations; employees are willing to help with your order, and you get your food relatively fast. Moreover, the interior has sufficient seating, and is nicely decorated. They offer a parking voucher for the nextdoor garage, but otherwise, finding street parking is a nightmare. My biggest reservation about Bento is their price point. For Asian-fusion cuisine, their kitchen menu items can be easily found at any Chinese takeout restaurant. Moreover, their dishes range upwards from about $9; a mixed vegetable noodle bowl with steak is already around $12. The amount of food that you get is not worth the price, especially when other takeout restaurants have lunch specials around $7."
3/19/2019,1,Out of Pad Thai and white rice. Only one drawer accepts  cash. This is a sad place to eat.  $16.59 for a bento box combo. The interior is similar to any fast food place.Miso Soup was obviously from a can.  Food was all cold. Not sure how your cook green beans so they shrivel and are rubber. I recognize this is meant for college kids but it was just really bad. Do not waste your time or money here
10/19/2019,2,"Meh. I came here because I really wanted miso soup, and I did get miso soup, so I won't complain about that. I also ordered pad Thai with tofu. The tofu was decent but the pad Thai was pretty gross and I didn't want to eat very much of it. And it took about 20 minutes for my food to come out. This is a decent option if you're dying for lots of vegetarian options, but I wouldn't come back here again."
3/10/2021,1,"Had a very unpleasant meal contemplating what was in my chicken. Egg? Who knows. Totally gross and will never be eating from here again. My Taro slush wasn't even purple, I have no idea what they prepared for me. The sushi rice was just a layer of mush. I wouldn't recommend this place to a single soul. What a disappointing and distasteful experience."
7/23/2021,5,"love their pad thai with pao pao chicken, make sure to get extra sauce in the side. this dish is life changing. if you like a little spice, definitely get this. the pad thai beats both the white rice and fried rice. we also had the Mexican roll which was really good, but the main entree outdid everything. the vanilla milk tea and strawberry milk slush were super good and recommended by the cashier. great experience and pls try the pao pao chicken it is life changing."
11/4/2019,3,"I enjoyed the pad thai here, the spice was just right. Passion fruit smoothie was tasty but I felt a bit too much ice for a smoothie. Overall, not bad, would return to try the sushi rolls."
6/19/2019,1,"Red curry tasted completely off today!Been eating Bento's curry katsu for many years, and it's usually awesome. Always ate my whole bowl! Today the red curry was completely horrible! Not sure if it was the whole batch or maybe something was wrong with just bowl. It didn't taste like it went bad, but more of a chemically taste to it. Maybe cleaning residue was in my bowl or the cookware? Not wanting to be difficult, I tried to eat it. Halfway, I had to stop and tell them about it. They were super nice and asked me if I wanted different curry on the side or remake of the order. I politely declined because my appetite was gone. Just wanted them to know something might be wrong with the curry, and that was pretty much the end of it. Consistency isn't too bad with Bento, but I've needed things remade before. I still love their food, but today was unacceptable.Side note: - The pork option for curry kastu is no longer offered. - Different noodles were used in the Lo Mein today; not sure if just this instance, this location, or a new thing. - Mini udon was not available at the time of ordering. TL;DR: poor quality and consistency today"
1/21/2019,5,"This new Bento is Awesome sauce with a capital A! The long wait is finally over and the new Bento location in The Standard right next to UF is finally open! Everyone is so super excited I was so happy to go in and give this place a try!  Bento started right here in Gainesville with the location on Newberry Road. They have now opened 12 locations in Gainesville, Jax, Tally and Orlando and are starting to move to South Florida! This new location inside The Standard is awesome. You have a big dining room, the colors look vibrant and great, they have a build your own Poke bowl station, and a long sushi line. You can get all your Bento favorites like Poke Poke Chicken (Spicy Mayo Chicken), fried rice, beer and broccoli, and Bento Boxes galore!  The staff here and the store manager are so nice and will accommodate you from the moment you come in to the moment you leave! I love this new Bento and since I work at UF will be coming here so much more!"
6/19/2020,2,"I love the food here, when it's good. It's definitely hit or miss though, no consistency in quality or quantity. I always order poke bowls and this last time was so off. Didn't have pretty much all the toppings I asked for, barely any lettuce, which was my base & a lot of it was black and gross. I ordered teriyaki steak, but got some rubbery chicken. Paid for extra sauces and didn't get those. Ordered Rangoons...didn't get those either! I don't think I'll be ordering from here anymore."
3/18/2020,5,"Bento is such a go-to if you're really craving sushi, they have it all! The staff is always kind and the service is definitely fast paced (:"
3/27/2020,2,The dictionary defines average as typical; common; ordinary. I can say with full confidence that this restaurant epitomizes the word average. My food arrives fresh and in a timely manner...sometimes. My requested sauces are included with the meal...rarely. And my girlfriend enjoys when we order this for a quiet night in...never. For the employees of this establishment I have but one question: WHERE ARE YOU HIDING MY SAUCE?If you want your meal as dry as the Sahara I suggest ordering from this restaurant. They will not let you down.
12/10/2019,1,"It's really sad that I had a poor experience at Bentos as it is one of my favorite places to eat. I walked in and had a pleasant experience ordering at the counter, the ladies up there were extremely kind. I ordered Yellowtail Sashimi, at 11:30am today and once I received my ordered, I asked the girl who brought it to me if she could ask the chef to cut the slices thinner. The chef did and when it was brought back to me, the slices were thinner but there was still only three pieces. I was under the impression that he would take the original slices and cut them in half. So now my original order is half the size. I decided to get up and talk to the chef to ask him to give me the original order but cut the big pieces thinner so I can get the food that I paid for. The chef was a tall, bearded man, probably in his later twenties, who then proceeded to argue with me. I asked him, ""Excuse me, my original order had more fish and now it's half the size, I just wanted the original pieces to be sliced thinner. Is that possible?""He replied and said, ""I was not told to do that. I was told to cut them thinner so I provided thinner pieces.""So I said once again, ""I understand, but is it possible to get the original pieces just sliced thinner?""He replied very rudely and said, ""yes it is. But I was not told to do that.""I stood there, staring blankly for a moment with no action from him, then asked again, ""May I please get my full order just turn the three pieces into six.""He snatched my plate and said, ""I wasn't told to do that.""He then proceeded to use the same pieces and just added extra pieces and cut the meat in half rather than slicing it while every employee in the restaurant paused and stared.He didn't look up at me and shoved the plate towards me.I truly have never been so surprised in my life to be treated in such a disrespected way. I've worked food services jobs for the past 12 years and not one of my employers would have tolerated such terrible customer service presented by their employee. To the jack ass who gave me my food and slammed the sushi door, first of all, calm down. I don't know what happened in your day that you have to ruin everyone else's. Put a smile on your face and learn to be patient and kind, it will return the favor to you one day."
10/5/2019,5,This place is straight fire. Great Menu with everything you could want and many different options to try. Food comes out relatively quick and in location close to campus
10/6/2019,3,Always delicious food. This location specifically is extremely slow at serving food. Sushi is always backed up. waiting for sushi here when I've been here has always been at least 40 mins for even 4 pieces. One out of five times I've gotten non sushi food here it taken less than 15 mins. Rest has been over 30 mins.
1/16/2020,5,"bento you can shine sushi,Chinese food,Thai food more convenient.food is great just one problem too busy need to wait for long time."
9/15/2020,5,The food here is amazing. I've had a great experience with deliveries from here. I recommended the special mexican roll with spicy mayo! Great job overall.
7/14/2019,3,"I come here to get a poke bowl almost weekly, but lately I've been noticing that between two and three ingredients I request for my poke bowl are not available each time I ask for them.  It shouldn't be difficult to keep simple ingredients in stock, and I come away frustrated after each experience at Bento even though the food is good."
3/15/2020,4,They have some nice meals and boba tea. It's a pretty convenient location next to campus and overall well maintained. The staff are pretty friendly.
2/10/2019,2,"I love Bento restaurants, as much as I love living in Gainesville. I loved this location when I first visited a few weeks ago. However, on a rainy evening tonight - it was a complete disappointment. I understand that the orders can take longer as it was completely packed (long line and customers standing around throughout the hall to be seated), but I do not get how food can get undercooked (hard and chewy udon noodle) and cold (tempura shrimp was almost under the room temperature).Most disappointing aspect was the response done by the kitchen staff for Japanese curry (for curry pork katsu bowl) for my order - it was extremely watery. I believe someone decided to add more water to the near empty curry sauce pot due to high demand, resulting watered down curry. When I asked for an explanation, the hall server staff member told me I will be provided with another curry. We waited for 15 minutes without being told that it was going to take longer - when it finally came to us, our food was already cold and no longer crunchy. We wish they told us in advance.Again, taking longer to cook for each order due to high volume of customers is completely understandable. However what I have difficult time to tolerate is the practice of willing to sacrifice the quality to meet the excess of demand, just to get by one shift.I really hope this change for the restaurant soon, so I can come back again in the near future."
6/6/2019,1,Very slow service. Waited almost 30 minutes for Our food and it arrived to the table cold.
5/17/2019,1,Ordered for delivery from here. They delayed my order for 2 and a half hours and counting. Do not recommend if you're hungry.
9/4/2019,1,"Ordered take out, waited for 20 minutes. Finally went to the desk to see 4 workers standing around and talking while only one was running the register. Come to find out, my food was waiting on the take out trey and they never let me know until I walked up. To top it all off, they completely messed up my order. This is not the first time I've been upset with bento. Will not be returning here."
3/16/2019,5,"I had Bento for the first time today and it was an extremely pleasant surprise! I don't typically eat rice or Asian food for that matter, so two years into going to UF and I finally tried it for lunch. I took a while to order since I wasn't sure what I'd like and I am super indecisive, so my cashier Britney walked me through the whole menu and recommended her favorite dishes. She was so patient and helpful so I am grateful for that! I came at a good time too because it was not very busy. As for the restaurant, it seemed very clean and it had reasonable prices. It is a little on the higher end, but you seriously get what you pay for. Also it being so convenient right near campus is a huge plus for me. Overall, I was satisfied, so I'll be seeing you again :)"
1/30/2020,5,"I love bento, it's so yummy & close to campus which is super convenient. I always get the bento box which is a little bit of everything that they offer. Their bubble tea is also very good :) Always quick service too. I have a peanut allergy and they are always very accommodating to my needs-- they write that I have an allergy in my order so I feel safe eating here too."
4/5/2019,1,I come to bento all the time on archer and it's perfect. This place has ran out of pad Thai TWICE. How do u do that??? So bad
2/5/2020,5,"I absolutely love this place! I am basically a regular here. The location is super convenient and the service is very good, although they tend to be a little slow when it gets busy. The food is very good, I enjoy every item I have tried on the menu. The sushi is very good and one of the best places around here for it. Overall I would highly recommend!"
11/19/2019,5,"Fried rice is always a go-to for me at Bento. The price and portioning are ideal. I go here a lot after class so the wait is never long, both to pay and to get my food. Love the free sauces! Wish they offered sweet tea!"
3/24/2019,1,"Very poor service I waited over 30 minutes for my food and over 30 minutes just waiting and ordering. I spent over an hour for a half ass bowl, because they were out of almost every item in stock including avocado asparagus mushrooms and broccoli. Pretty embarrassing to be a ""high-class"" quick service restaurant when there's nothing in stock and food takes over an hour to prepare. They are highly staffed and still it takes this long. It is actually ridiculous."
7/9/2019,5,great place. service is always fast and my order was never wrong/ poorly made. I have always had great experiences here. Their sushi and poke bowls are amazing. The fish is so fresh and tasty. Everything is prepared to order. Very clean and well kept
8/31/2019,1,"Yeah I used to work at a sushi restaurant, Sushi and Pan in Miami, Fl, and this place does not compare. Bento overcharges for sushi, and for the overcharged sushi it's, at best, mediocre. I got the Red Dragon roll w out cream cheese and instead of spicy mayo, i asked for eel sauce, which was just a line of sauce across the roll. The overall taste was bland, and to be honest super unfilling."
5/13/2019,5,"Loved Bento and their Japanese dishes. It is very hard to locate Japanese place in Florida that serves great Japanese food. Their food is served pretty fast, clean property, and great customer service. If you want great Japanese food, this is the place!"
1/23/2019,1,"I was hospitalized after eating a Special Mexican Roll from here two days ago. My food poisoning was awful and when I shared the news with my friends, THREE other people told me they got food poisoning from Bento too. Wouldn't recommend to ANYONE."
7/24/2022,5,Great food! This came in very well made boxes that made the food feel luxurious! One of the best noodles and chicken I've ever had
1/14/2022,3,"First off the staff here is very friendly and provided excellent service. My review is primarily about the food and the pricing here. There is a $4.00 upcharge for fried rice. That seems very high upcharge for a dish that is already on the pricier side. I tried the poke bowl with the teriyaki chicken. The chicken was pretty chewy, and the flavors simply were not there for me. I ended up taking some of my husband's pineapple chicken since I didn't like what I ordered. The pineapple chicken tasted really good, but the overall price just seems high. The poke bowl seemed more reasonably priced, but sadly the chicken was not the star of the dish. The fountain machine was broken here, but thankfully the staff was friendly and brought our drinks to us. Overall it was an alright lunch experience."
1/19/2022,5,"Bento is one of my favorite lunch spots! My favorite dish is the udon Katsu soup bowl. The soup was piping hot, and the chicken was super crispy. The portions were just right too. I also recommend the teriyaki chicken bowl! On tuesdays, the teriyaki chicken bowl has a discount!"
3/14/2022,5,"My poke bowl was so beautiful! The fish was fresh and the produce was also! They were very generous on the rice, but I was okay with that. Prices are comparable with other poke locations in the area but better quality in my opinion. My boyfriend got the steak bento and he seemed to enjoy his meal. I would definitely come back here!"
12/17/2020,5,"Nice selection of rolls, with the ""classic"" rolls still fancier than other places. They are a couple of dollars more than other places, but the sushi is really good. I got rolls to go. Ordering online was easy, but we still had to wait a few minutes after we showed up for the scheduled pickup. The site has pictures of all the rolls in case you are unsure what you're getting.I got the Mt. Fuji roll (krab, shrimp tempura, krab delite, scallion, eel sauce) $9. It's a roll with toppings included. My friend got the red dragon (tuna, shrimp tempura, krab, avocado, cream cheese, masago, spicy mayo) $11.50. So the signature rolls aren't much more than the classic and that have some interesting combos to try something new.There's a lot of parking, ordering is easy, and the rolls were tasty. They also have bento boxes (hence the name), bowls, and boba tea. A great variety if you want to come with someone who isn't into sushi."
1/29/2022,5,"We were very impressed with the food, service, and takeout experience! We decided to try two bento boxes (sesame seed with shrimp and sichuan with tofu) plus the egg rolls. All were delicious! Ingredients were fresh and food was well-prepared. The order was packed up nicely and it was ready to go early! We will be back to try other bentos and bowls."
6/11/2021,5,I LOVE BENTO! Like theeee best place for me when eating a poke bowl! I was super happy to enjoy my bowl as it's been before covid since I last had it. Omg my bowl hit the spot and some! It made me super happy that the bowl was everything and more than I imagined! I've had their sushi rolls and other stuff but I always come here just for the poke bowls! It always feels like it was made with LOVE! Very satisfying for sure! I think this time I ate a little more than my eyes could handle but it's definitely worth it!
9/16/2020,5,"There are several Bento's in the GNV area, but this one and the Newberry road location are consistently good. I pick up the phone, press 1, place my order, and know exactly what I'm going to get. There's a comfort in that, especially if you eat not only because you need to. On a typical day, I find myself lovingly looking at their Chicken Veggie Stir fry bowl, placed comfortably over a plush mountain of white rice. Sitting next to me is my other half, devouring Shrimp Veggie Stir Fry. (he took my advice), but his has a side of Teriyaki, which tastes amazing in a warm reunion with the stir fry sauce. I'm not sure why, but Shrimp is unavailable as a protein to be combined with Teriyaki sauce, so I just ask for it on the side and hack the system. You get bang for your buck here, there's no doubt about that. It's usually fast, and hits the spot. If I find myself getting a Bento craving, I hold off until around 2:30-4:00pm, this is when they are least busy. They'll tell you it's 15-20 minutes, but it's usually done in 5 minutes. Arrive early if you can, as my orders have gotten cold quickly up on the take-out shelf. The interior is lacking a bit, leaves something to be desired and not really inviting. It's simple, you can watch the Sushi Chefs do their thing, or enjoy a spot outside in the sun/daily down pour. Depending on your luck."
2/25/2022,3,Benny Hannah is pissed off. Undercooked hard white rice. OK stop right there. Cooking white rice in a rice cooker should be the easiest thing ever. How does an Asian restaurant filled with non-Asian employees miss-fire on the rice? This is what happens when churn and burn fast casual gets a hold of Japanese cuisine.  Spent $16. Actual value $5. Fix the rice!Chicken Bento 2/21/22 Dinner:
2/8/2022,2,"First timer and last time, eating here. What you get for the money, it's not worth it. The food flavor was great but did amount was very disappointing. Look at the pictures for proof!"
4/8/2020,3,"Bento is an A-OK restaurant to go to in Gainesville. No, it's not going to blow you away because of exquisite food or decor. You go because it has become a Gainesville classic, a go to hangout place if you will. If you spend any amount of time in Gainesville as a student attending UF (Go Gators!), chances are you will find yourself coming here at least once. If you happen to attend any of the on campus Asian organizations, chances are you probably lost track of the amount of time you've been here and spent here lol.As for the food, it's solid. It satisfies you when you crave it and it fills you up. Like this time as I was passing through Gainesville, I got the shrimp tempura udon soup. It was a good portion size, not too expensive, and the shrimp was fried well. Nice and crispy on the outside while not having too much batter on it. While it won't compare to the food at say Sushi Matsuri, Bento will always hold a special place in my heart. Dropping by here and getting food will always make me feel like I'm back home in the Swamp"
12/4/2021,1,"Bento is supposed to be an easy and quick lunch/dinner stop, and somehow my orders are never ready when they're supposed to be, and something is always missing. This is now the 4th time that my boba tea has come with no boba even after paying for extra. Honestly just a waste of time and money ordering at the Archer road location."
8/10/2021,5,"If you like a little bit of spicy-ness, Get the bento box with gochujang (korean pepper paste) chicken.It is sooo DELICIOUS!Everything else in the bento box was fresh, crisp, clean and it did not leave me with that heavy feeling you get from burgers or pizza."
3/27/2022,4,"Stopped in for a late dinner based on a recommendation. We ordered a roll of sushi, which was nice and fresh and two rice bowls - both of which were really good. As we watched food come out, everything looked good and the portions looked large. I'll definitely go back - maybe to this location the next time I'm in town, or to one of their other locations closer to home."
1/11/2020,4,"This is very disappointing as I always loved Bento. However, I found black bits that looked like burnt pieces or possibly even dried grease from I cleaned stoves and oven. My whole food is inedible and possible dangerous to eat. Very disappointed! Edit: I spoke to a person named Dalia and she handled the reorder very well. Thanks to her the stars went up. Good customer service."
12/16/2019,3,"Awhile back I had couple friends in Gainesville going to school at UF.A long time ago maybe 10 years ago this place was the place to go for lunch. Coming to Gainesville again reminded me of the old times and I stop by while driving back to Atlanta.This place use to be mad packed and waiting took forever.When I arrived, the place looks the same and was still poplar by the looks of it. I order same thing I order from back in the days Spicy pork and my friend order Tempura Udon, we also added Volcano roll.Our food came out pretty fast but our Volcano roll took awhile.For some reason my spicy pork was a little sour which didn't seem right.Ate about 2-3 bites then just couldn't eat it.The udon however was the bomb. My friend love the udon and it was great.Our volcano roll came out after we were done with our main.Volcano was decent but wasn't like how it use to be or it could be back in the days we were young and we could have ate anything at that time.But coming back here brings a lot of memories and as great.If your in town for some decent food or a warm Udon this is the place.They also sell Bubble tea."
4/13/2021,4,"Bento is a consistent 4 stars for me. It's above average, not spectacular but not horrible. I ordered a poke bowl for delivery with 2 proteins, salmon and yellow tail. The bowl itself was good, nothing in the bowl was bad. I appreciated the add ons that were added in. My favorites are the wakame salad, edamame, and ginger. If I had to make one suggestion, I'd say there was not enough protein. I ordered two proteins thinking there would be a decent amount of salmon and yellow tail. Unfortunately, they skimped on the protein as there were only a few pieces of each. I feel as if the poke bowl from Poke Station gives much more protein compared to Bento. Both poke bowls are comparable quality wise. Because of this, I slightly prefer the Poke Station bowls over the Bento ones. The positive thing about Bento is that there is more variety in food options compared to Poke Station. Overall, I'd pick Poke Station if I wanted a poke bowl specifically, but Bento for the variety."
6/6/2021,1,Terrible sushi rolls. Very small and flavorless. They are very skimpy on the sauce and my rolls were very salty. I've had better sushi from grocery stores.
9/7/2021,5,"Fresh food (chicken teriyaki) and great service! Their manager, Elena, and all staff was extremely attentive and accommodating!"
12/19/2021,5,"Love Bentos! Great value for even better quality food. Sushi has become a recent favorite for me. Elena was outstanding! Food took a little long, so she offered my a courtesy drink. Very impressed with the customer service."
12/23/2021,1,Service took way too long for our food from the kitchen. My bento box with veggie stir fry entree was covered in way too much mediocre sauce and the vegetables were over cooked. The whole meal cost nearly $80 for 2 adults and 3 kids for less food and lower quality than you get at a Chipotle (and chipotle costs half as much). I will not be going to one of these restaurants again.
11/11/2020,3,"We stopped here on a road trip and while the food was decent, the customer service and wait were not. There was definitely and inconsistency in urgency and speed among the staff. The team putting the food in to-go bags were so slow. They took so much time putting things together after the food was ready. I could see bags just waiting behind the counter to be put on the grab and go shelves. And with all the time they took, an extra 20 minutes after my order should have been ready, they didn't include any silverware or chopsticks in the bag. Luckily we had a couple packaged plastic forks in the glove compartment or else eating the rice bowl in the car would've been difficult. I understand a dinner rush, but there seemed to be some room for improvement. The food was good though and was exactly what we were looking for"
3/27/2022,1,"Don't ask for them to put rice and meat in separate bowls. It blows their mind and apparently can't be done. I get that it's a different ask maybe slightly out of the ordinary. But seriously looking dumbfounded about wanting the rice and chicken in separate bowls and the ""manager"" saying just can't be done is a riot."
3/26/2022,1,"Not only did we have to wait a long time, the food was drowning in oil, sauce and, ""flavor."" It was overwhelming and upset our stomachs. First time getting food here, because my girlfriend wanted Asian food, and probably the last time."
7/23/2018,3,"Bento is one of those places that you usually know what to expect every single time. I went on a Thursday night and was not surprised to see it was busy and the line was longer. Usually larger groups go together and pay individually since it is counter service and I wish they did a better job of encouraging them to move so the line moves.Bento is OK Chinese, Japanese fusion food. It's overpriced and they give you a decent amount. I got a Bento box with orange chicken and brown rice. It came with green beans, a side salad, and fried wonton wrapper with a sweet glaze. My friend and I also split a Volcano roll. Again this was OK but way over priced for food that I can get elsewhere cheaper. I usually come to Bento with others but it's not my preferred place to go solo if I want a quick and cheap meal."
10/10/2020,1,"I ordered takeout from this restaurant last night & I was extremely disappointed. I ordered Szechuan chicken bowl & I checked the menu multiple times to make sure that the dish didn't have nuts since I am severely allergic to tree nuts. The online menu states ""carrot, string beans, broccoli, scallion sweet + spicy garlic sauce"" & I still had an allergic reaction. Either the kitchen isn't clean & cross contamination took place or they are not straightforward with their menu. I would not recommend eating here if you have severe allergies."
10/17/2021,3,"food was ok. it was very expensive and when we got our food, there was no ginger sauce on the ginger salad. also i ordered with noodle soup and there weren't many udon noodles in it along with only on price of bok choy and they didn't include a lot of the stuff it usually comes with."
5/6/2019,1,"Bento has highly disappointed me.The store opens at 11:30, I got there at 11:35. I was third in line and a huge rush of people came in behind me. I ordered a poke bowl (which I'm happy they added a mini version cause the regular is a decent size if you get it with rice). And I also ordered the lovers boba tea (and they ran out of boba too on a Monday morning). The lady who took my ordered was visibly stressed and answered the store phone in the middle of me trying to get my order in. I should note that I am aware bento does take their time to have their food out. Within 5 minutes I got my boba tea and it was refreshing! But 30 minutes went by and I noticed the people behind me in line already got their food. I went up and asked how long my food was going to take because at that point I was already on a time crunch. I did not have a complicated order, it was a mini and regular poke bowl. They asked me if I had it to go and I confirmed I did. And the staff told me well we take priority in dine in first and then take out. According to the staff, it was their policy. They asked if I wanted a refund and I said no, I came here for a service and it hasn't been provided. I've waited for over half an hour, I've waited for so long, I just wanted my food. A refund would not have fixed the time I already spent there. The policy makes no sense because what difference would it have made if I made it for dine in and then asked for to go boxes? On top of that, I had to ask for the sauces I ordered because they didn't put the right sauce I asked for in the bag. The food itself was adequate, the wonton chips I ordered were soggy. The soda machine had no carbonation so it was unavailable. I know things can go wrong at restaurants but you should avoid the customer trying to see that and provide the service they have paid for. Bento has highly disappointed me."
4/19/2020,4,"Was looking something for everyone on a Friday night stuck in the house. Dinner and a movie sounded good, so after looking through options everyone agreed on Bento. A place we only typically drop in when at shopping centers or out of town. We ordered, and got quick contactless delivery. The food arrived hot in organized bentos box containers with out anything crossing over to the wrong place!! Everyone finished and enjoyed the meal. Was a great way to break up the boredom for the kids. We also got a variety of milk teas and shake with bobas. The kids where happy and the night in seamed like a success."
10/27/2017,3,First time here. Atmosphere: chill and good for casual dining or even a date.Service: food was promptly cooked and staff was very friendly and courteous.Food: the food was decent. My spicy beef bulgogi was a bit too salty for my tastes but the spicy creamy chicken was very good but the pieces of chicken were way too breaded. The portion sizes are ok but if you are really hungry then one bowl might not be enough for you.Overall I think this place is very good for casual dining or even group dining. Would recommend anyone in the area to try it out at least once.
11/8/2016,4,"Four years, Bento, four years without you.Had food here while in town with a friend of mine. The place is even more busy than I remember! Parking now has quite become atrocious compared to back in the day, hence why I am taking off one star.Other than that, the food is still a good bang for your buck. I treated my friend for his birthday and with his garbage disposal ways and my food intake, I still didn't make it to $30. We ordered miso soup, chicken stirfry, some nigiri, and a Mongolian beef bowl (or at least I think that's what it was). Everything was delicious, and well, my friend stuffed himself and I had food leftovers.I found out now that they apparently have expanded to South Florida, so I'll be visiting to see if it's as good as this location. Until next time, Bento. We have finally met again, and well, given that you've franchised in my neck of the woods, it definitely won't be another four years without you."
4/26/2019,5,"Awesome pan Asian food for a quick meal! Great service and great quality. Most of my typical meals here are the sushi, Vietnamese pork chop bowl, or the poke bowl. Cannot go wrong with the bento box either. Definitely recommend!"
5/5/2020,3,Do not order delivery. Only go there if you order tofu. Somehow the chefs at Bento assume tofu can be substituted for chicken. Sure in many respects they look a like. Normally this would come off as a one time mess up and easily forgiven. This has happened a minimum of five different delivery orders from this location. The mid town location did this so many times I started ordering from this one. This local does the same thing. If I'd ordered tofu extra protein I'd get chicken and tofu or just chicken.This review is similar to my mid town review due to the fact that two locations are doing the same thing. When dining in it seems they actually check the ticket for accuracy. But delivery is a gamble I lose enough to stop ordering.
7/22/2021,2,"In the last 6 months or so a poke bowl has risen from $11, to $13, and today they rose to $15. Lunch for 2 with tax is now $32, without tip. $32 feeds a family of 4, ribeye steaks. I'm done."
5/7/2020,1,"Went to grab take out today. Only 2 people in the restaurant at a time, which is fine   Once we waited for our meal, NO Utensils.  We had already left for our appt When I called back was told , YOU HAVE TO ASK!!  WTF was not asked about that nor drinks. Crappy staffing on the register today!!"
1/25/2019,4,"Chicken fried rice tender, edamame great.  Veggie rolls were soggy inside.  Bento box of chicken Katsu is daughter's go to favorite.  Husband had tofu rice bowl.  Didn't realize they offer sake, next visit will try.  Good value for all the food you get.  Eat in or order takeout."
6/13/2016,4,"I can't believe I've never left a review for Bento after all these years. I was enrolled at UF back when this Bento opened (referred to as ""Bento Red"") and I've eaten here countless times. Bento serves their food made-to-order, from hot foods, sushi, boba, and now poke bowls.The ordering area at Red is really cramped, considering how many customers they serve. When I went, they only had 1 register taking orders even though there were a lot of people in line. The other register is a dedicated line for call ahead pick-ups. *PRO-TIP: If you know what you want to order, call ahead!! You'll save a lot of time waiting!!Inside dining is mostly full-service: servers will bring your food to your table, and come around to ask if you need anything during your stay. When you're finished, you leave the dishes on the table and they will clean up.My go-to sushi order is the spicy tuna-salmon don. They pack a LOT of fresh fish on sushi rice and they're very generous with the spicy mayo (but you can customize your bowl the way you like).I tried the new rice-less rolls and had the Surf N Kawaii roll. It has krab, tempura shrimp, tuna, avocado, masago, and eel sauce. It is a great Lo-carb option but you still want sushi."
2/6/2019,4,"Overall, Bento has been a consistently good place to get a quick meal. It's one of those places that you can go to when no one can agree on where to eat. There's plenty of menu options, so almost everyone will find something they like on the menu. I tend to go with the Sriracha Garlic Tofu, and it never lets me down. The tofu is always really crunchy, which I love. While Bento does get really busy, I've never waited unreasonable amount of time for my food. This particular visit, was the only time I've been unhappy with how my food tasted. The broccoli and garlic tofu came out soft and squishy, unlike any of their tofu I've tried before. Additionally, the rice seemed over cooked and soggy. I just wasn't a fan of the flavor in general. I don't think this experience is representative of Bento as a whole, as this was the first time I've been disappointed, and I'm sure I'll be back again soon for another chance."
3/10/2016,3,This review is not in regards to their sushi menu. Pros:I like their spicy miso ramen soup. It's on the menu for a limited time but I hope it becomes a permanent item. It's flavorful and filling. Their Szechuan beef soup had a very tasty broth but the noodles were overcooked the one time I ordered it. Hopefully that's not the norm. Cons:It takes way too long just to order your food sometimes. They almost always only have one cashier at the register. People tend to ask questions about what they are ordering and it's generally just a slow process. They really should have two cashiers to get things moving along. It's frustrating.
7/9/2018,2,"I usually love Bento, I mean, who doesn't? But I won't be returning to this location unfortunately. I always order the same exact thing at Bento, the Spicy Cream Chicken Rice bowl. At one point, it came with these terribly insane huge sliced peppers and string beans. Then, just peppers for whatever reason and I was paying extra for string beans. Recently, I confirmed with both locations that the meal comes with string beans and haven't had an issue with the Newberry location yet. The peppers are WAY too huge for my liking, so I prefer string beans so I go out of my way to ask every time if the ""current"" recipe is peppers & string beans. I did the same this time, the cashier assured me that both were included and I said, ""ya know what. May I have extra?"" She says, ""Sure, but it'll be a dollar extra."" I said, ""No problem! But they come with them already right? [she nods] Great! Then I'll have more than usual because I'm paying extra? Awesome."" Joking but not joking at all. So my friend and I go sit outside and her bowl comes with no veggies (she didn't specify no veggies) and mine comes out with about 20 string beans. 20. Vs. that HUGE bowl, like, did that even look balanced back in the kitchen? The worst part is, I nicely asked the waiter if there was anything to be done because sheesh, I could walk to Wards and bring 3 pounds of string beans back for a buck and you all could only give me THIS? The waiter took it back to the kitchen and brought it right back to me saying, ""yeah that's even more than the usual."" Bleh. You all couldn't make a customer happy by simply adding a few more veggies to a majorly unbalanced bowl. I'll stay away from Bento for a while and when I come back, I'll stick with any other location than this one because customer service is not their strong point."
3/28/2018,4,This location has improved their service size and quality of food over the past few yearsThis is now back to a go to joint for my friends and familyHighly recommend
8/14/2020,5,Had pad thai for the first time in a long time with tofu. Haven't had the pad thai from Bento until today. Really good. Tofu is good. I'm pretty full.
2/17/2020,1,"Was in at 759 pm on 2/16. Placed my order and waited 30 minutes. Many other patrons came in, ordered and picked up their food and left. My take out was simply soup and a sesame rice bowl. Very disappointed, had canceled an order at P.F. Chang's for a 20-30 minute wait thinking I could've got in and out of here quicker..Even sadder was the fact that my wife had to ask where her order was, and apparently it had been sitting there for a while."
1/17/2018,3,"I used to love Bento, but they always get rid of the best items on their menu. The parking is so limited, and half of the time the soda machine is out of what you want to drink. I'm not sure if management changed, but the restaurant certainly has. Bring back the tuna tataki :("
5/10/2018,3,"If you need a quick meal, Bento is always a dependable place to go. With a diverse menu of sushi and kitchen entrees, there are various options to choose from. However, I have seen Bento increase their prices over the years; a rice/noodle bowl or sushi bowl can range from $8 - $12 now. Even so, they give you a decent amount of food.I do enjoy that Bento is relatively quick with preparing their meals and taking orders. However, it is more efficient to call in and order/takeout, if you are really in a rush. I find that their kitchen staff is significantly faster than their sushi chefs, so the wait is a little bit longer for sushi. There are always plenty of open tables and several waiters walking around to assist you. The ambience is super casual; somewhere in between a fast food place and sit-in restaurant. I always order the spicy salmon don/bowl, which is similar to a poke-bowl, but with prearranged toppings. I also enjoy that they give you extra sauces free of charge! Bento has definitely become a Gainesville staple, but there are other options nearby!"
8/8/2017,5,"Bento is the kind of place that gives you all the feels when you come back to Gainesville. I've always been a big fan of bento - reasonably priced, quick service, and good sushi. I personally love to get the spicy don tuna bowl. But also highly enjoy their spicy cream chicken and red dragon roll. Plus if you check in on Facebook you get $1 off your order!"
6/29/2018,4,"I went to UF a few years back and still have friends who live here for work. So I occasionally come to visit, but every time I do, I always make sure to stop by bento! First, let's talk about parking. Their parking lot is ALWAYS busy. So getting ideal parking spaces are hard, especially on the weekend. Once you walk in, you'll usually see a line, but it goes by pretty quick. They have a two sided menu. One side for kitchen food, the other side is more like sushi/poke bowls. Every time I come here, I order Pork Katsu Curry bowl. Hands down, best katsu curry I ever had!! I always get red because it's spicy and I love spicy. I honestly don't think it's spicy at all, but everyone intakes are different. The katsu has a lot of flavor and very crispy!! Add the red curry with it and BAM, amazing. It has never failed me. So it's definitely a must try!!"
6/9/2019,3,"Bento is my go to Thai food in Gainesville. I usually stick to their creamy curry chicken bowl, with extra chicken (since it's a bit bowl of rice and 8pieces of chicken). The food is flavorful and consistent. Price is decent. Although it's mostly carbs on the majority of their meals. Restaurant is always clean and the food usually comes out relatively quick, especially since it's always busy. Staff is friendly."
7/25/2019,5,A haiku about the archer bentos amazing customer service:The new cashier guyrecommended bobba tea He deserves a raise
11/8/2019,5,"Bento is a busy restaurant and usually when it comes to take out or delivery a lot of mistakes are made, with that said, today I came in for a pick up I placed with Uber Eats, I was greeted my a young man named Dimitrius. Wow an expectional example of perfect and friendly customer service. In the past 4 years we have lived in Gainesville I have not ever felt as welcomed and pleasantly greeted as I was by Dimitrius. I told him it was very important I have chopstick enough for our family on the order we placed. He double checked the order before I got it and made sure I had enough, Bento ALWAYS forgets to provide chopsticks on delivery and pick ups.I was very impressed and hope going forward in the future they find more employees like him.Oh yes the food was great as always."
12/12/2020,5,They're always very busy in the evening and have a bit of a wait but it's because they're so good and they're poke bowls are the best! Love Bento!
11/15/2019,3,"My family and I have been eating at Bentos since there was only the Newberry road location, so we have a long history with them.  Initially Bentos was awesome with great food, environment and customer service.  We didn't mind spending our money at Bentos because it was just that good to us.  LATELY, our last 6 visits have not been good and weve been to both locations.   We attempted to try the new location but after waiting in the phone for over 20 minutes and being told it would be an hour wait, we decided not to try the downtown location.  For some unknown reason you have to request wasabi and ginger with your order.  I requested it 4 times, was told it was in my order, only to get home and find it wasn't. We just threw the food away. I'm not sure what's going on with Bentos but we are going to try other places from now on."
9/27/2017,5,"I just read some other Yelpers reviews and I don't know what got their panties in a twist because this place is phenomenal and has been for years. I have been eating at Bento since 2007 and it was solid then and it is solid now. All you need as proof of this is to drive by on a Friday night and see the line backed up into the dining room. The food is fresh, fast, and savory.I order the Spicy Cream Chicken with noodles and it comes with green beans. I like to refer to this chicken as ""donut chicken"" because the fried exterior is sweet with the perfect amount of crunch and the sauce gives it just the right amount of spice and tang. I feel guilty eating it because I know it is loaded with fat and they give you such a nice portion but it is my special treat when I go to Gainesville for games. In fact, it is our Friday night routine. My husband and I drive to Gville after work and get to Bento before we even check into our hotel room. We are even willing to stand in the aforementioned line for upwards of 30 minutes to get a bite of some Spicy Cream chicken. I love the décor. It is very lively, colorful, and modern. They have a large dining room at their Archer location and they also have the Coke Freestyle (always a hit). They offer sushi and milk tea but I don't ever order these options so I cannot comment on them. It is a hit with students and alumni alike. I recommend it to everyone! Go there, you'll like it."
8/27/2019,3,"Usually my go-to however, I waited an unusually long time for a small poke bowl with 3 toppings while the rest of my family got their orders quickly. The milk tea is horrible. Food was loved by everyone but me. They were stingy with avocado portions and for only having 3 toppings total I would've appreciated a good amount of avocado but they put a crack ton of furikake instead I guess. Also they were out of cucumber, and we came as soon as they opened. TLDR: Typically good food with bad milk tea and inconsistent service/quality"
1/15/2018,5,"One of my favorite Asian cuisine restaurants! I don't live in Gainesville, but almost every time I'm in Gainesville i have to eat at Bento. I have never had a bad meal here. I usually get a noodle bowl, such as creamy chicken or pad Thai. They have a large variety of rice/noodle bowls and you get choose your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.). Last night I got chicken pad Thai and it did not disappoint. The sushi is very good as well. They have a large variety of classic and specialty rolls. The bento box is the best deal, you get 16 pieces for about $10, but you can only choose from the classic rolls. I also like how they have option of ordering half rolls on most or their rolls....so you can mix and match if you want some variety. Not too expensive either, will be $12-$14 if you get a fountain drink with your meal. They also have boba tea!!"
10/20/2018,4,"So I'm a sucker for a variety of tastes.  Was visiting my son at UF and he suggested BC for lunch.  I and the Pad Thai and a roll.  Let me say it was not great but OK.  I think food wise it is a three star, however concept wise it is four star and I was enjoying the company and place.  Prices were very fare and I would certainly return."
9/16/2016,4,"Made a quick stop here while on the road last weekend. Considering it was a Friday evening and there was a decent line, they were able to get people's orders efficiently. I ordered the orange chicken with noodles and a mango green tea while my wife ordered Thai pineapple shrimp rice bowl and a taro milk tea. I know my choice wasn't very adventurous but it was delicious. The chicken was more meat than breaded/fried bits which I greatly appreciated. The noodles were noodles, but there were a lot of them. I'm a sucker for mango so I loved the tea. My wife loved the pineapple shrimp. There weren't many pieces of pineapple but at least the flavor was there. She also had a lot of rice. The milk tea was delicious. Overall, my first trip to Bento was enjoyable and tasty. I'd recommend it."
11/17/2018,4,"This is the only place I can count on to give me a really good poke bowl. Every time I go it is perfect and their fish is high quality. I also enjoy their miso soup but sometimes it does not come out as hot as I would like it. Lately their service has been slow and they choose to only use one register rather than two, but I always leave happy because the food is worth the wait."
2/15/2018,4,"Always love coming to Bento Cafe. My favorite here is the Bento Box with General Tso's chicken. The variety of ginger salad, protein, rice, green beans and lo mein is well worth the price. You'll leave satisfied and without hurting your wallet so much. Great spot to step in for lunch or a night out for dinner. The dragon roll is also great. Never disappoints."
12/17/2018,4,"This is not my first nor my last time coming to Bento. I love their noodle bowls, edamame, and find the portion size just right. I see that they've changed their menu since I moved out of town, but no changes that negatively impact my experience. I like the build your own poké bowl option and the noodle bowls never disappoint for a fast Asian food option."
9/12/2018,4,"Not the biggest fan of their food, but their sushi is reasonably priced and pretty decent! It is a fast-food version of Asian food, so don't expect much quality from this place. It's a great spot for students who are on a budget and want some Asian food."
3/17/2016,4,"I have been coming to Bento for many years now. I left Gainesville back in 2010, but whenever I am in town I try to stop by Bento. I have always loved their sushi and their Bento boxes. My favorite roll is the Japanese Bagel. Unlike most sushi place's JB roll, I'm pretty sure they use smoked salmon and not plain raw salmon. I'm obsessed! The only issue I have with Bento is that there is always a super long wait. This most recent visit I waited over half an hour for 2 boba teas and 4 rolls. No idea why it takes so long. Maybe they are short staffed?"
12/29/2014,4,"I'd call this place ""fast food sushi"". It's good for what it is! We were in town for a couple hours and were in the mood for something fast and sushi related. BINGO Bento! I had a National Champ roll which consisted of a Mexican roll with a baked spicy mayo scallop mix on top. It was pretty good. My favorite part was the Honeydew smoothie with Mango jellies! It was delicious! This restaurant is average price and provides a pretty good bang for your buck. There's free parking in the parking lot at the front. The bathrooms are one stall each gender. You place your order at the front of the restaurant and receive a number where someone then delivers the food to you when it's ready. It's definitely worth checking out!"
1/8/2020,4,"I'm surprised this place has such low stars?  Altho to be fair we ordered delivery from Bento Asian Sushi Kitchen for the first time over the summer and were not impressed; because we did not order their specialty/ what they are known for but rather what we were craving at the moment. They do have a large selection to include multiple Asian cousins (Thai wasn't our favorite here). About 3 months ago I realized that a ton of Sushi places in the area focus on sushi rolls (which we have stopped eating for a long time as we developed a favoring of Sashimi and Omakase). For this reason I started to crave rolls and decided to try bento's rolls since they forgot to include our Fuji and Miami rolls (from our first order) so we never got to try their rolls. We got the Fuji, Miami, Spicy Mexican, Volcano and Caliente initially. Since then I have order the Volcano and Caliente rolls at least twice a week and they are truly heavenly. So, this is one of those places where you have to find your items (ours ended up to be their specialty rolls) since they have such a large variety of food!  My advice is take a chance as I'm so glad we didn't let our first experience turn us away for good!"
3/21/2019,1,"Found this stuck in the rice of my chicken tonkatsut bowl. Not knowing what it is, look a bit scary in real life. Got a stomachache  afterward. This place use to be good but definitely not anymore. The chicken taste old and rubbery"
1/13/2019,4,"God bless Bento.They offer entry-level pan-Asian cuisine that is affordable and accessible, without making you feel like you just ate fast food. Once you can make your way through the omnipresent atrocious lines at literally every hour of the day, the service is quick and professional. You order at the counter and then they offer a hybrid table service. No need to clean up after yourself, folks!I'm super predictable here - I always get the garlic and broccoli bento box with chicken. My partner is a much more adventurous human being and mixes it up with poke bowls and sushi. He's always pleased and comments on how fresh it tastes, which is great because we come from Fort Lauderdale where you sometimes have to wait for your fish to be caught at dinner. Back to the wait. This place is so insanely busy that sometimes we skip it because we just CANNOT spiritually handle standing in line for that long. They have got to open up more registers when the line snakes and triples around the lobby area. Come on, guys.Hopefully, their opening up the third location under the Standard by campus will help alleviate some of the wait times and we can come back more often."
4/8/2019,4,"I love this place and get takeout from here pretty much every week now. I wrote a prior review when they weren't doing as well and they really have made it better. The only complaint I have is still attached below.The take out process is terrible. You can't order online and they phone only has one line, so you can try for half an hour without ever getting through to actually place an order sometimes.Otherwise this place is one of my favorites, they are always fast dining in and once you place a takeout order they get it done quick. The staff is always friendly and I have never waited more than 30 seconds to be greeted by someone at the Togo counter. They deserve the credit for really improving the last few months. Come and try it out, it's worth it!"
7/19/2018,3,"Quick spot to come pick up asian type food. They have sushi rolls, bento boxes, and wok/grilled options. I think the pricing is pretty good and it's a decent place to stop by if you're looking for a quick meal."
9/14/2019,1,"When I visited Bento, every surface I touched was sticky. I was quite appalled by the lack of non sticky surfaces. I ended up just asking for my sushi to go because I was not okay with the level of stick up in there. I asked for the manager to let her know that maybe they should clean differently because of how STICKY it was, and she was like ""I'm sorry"" and all that but the whole time she was eating noodles while talking and I couldn't even finish the conversation I just left. I believe she said her name was Katy Lynn???"
6/5/2019,4,"I love Bento! I recently went with some friends to the Bento location on Archer Road and it just makes me love Bento more and more. I don't think you can ever get too much Bento! Bento on Archer Road is in the same plaza as Chipotle, Vale Food Co, and Relish. This is awesome because all of these places are semi-local. Why I say semi-local is Bento and Relish started in Gainesville but have now expanded to other cities in Florida and Vale started in Tally but quickly made Gainesville their home after getting started. During my meal at Bento I got some of my favorites like Pow Pow Chicken (Spicy cream chicken) and I got some sushi rolls as well. They were all amazing and I loved them. Reason for not 5 stars. The guy who took our order was just not nice. I think he was having a bad day, but un the end you should still be nice about it. He was just rude so it took away from the service I normally get here. I will for sure be back!"
12/26/2017,1,"It has been a very long year without Bento, and I was pumped to be back in town and have my usual spicy beef bulgogi rice bowl. For reference, I was here once a week when I used to live in Gainesville (14+ years of loyalty, folks!)I had heard complaints about how this Bento must have changed management or cooks since the food wasn't as good anymore, but I chose to come back anyways and see for myself. My bulgogi bowl was totally different - it had broccoli instead of scallions, the meat was half fat, and it was SO salty. Also, they only have plastic utensils now and I thought it was weird the waitress didn't bring utensils or napkins to the table with our food which used to be the norm.I don't think I'll be back, and I'd go as far as to warn others not to come or to maybe try the newberry location instead."
10/21/2015,4,"An Asian QSR? Yes, please!I didn't know such a thing existed but I'm walking on air. Going in blindly it can initially be confusing. Where to go---what to do? Not to fear as the cashier explains everything to you and it's rather simple. Pick one from wok, bento, sushi or soup bowl then your protein. Place your order, pay and they bring your meal to your table. I had the ginger scallion chicken bento and it was plentiful. It's all reasonably priced and you get a full meal. As with fast food restaurants, their tables are not cleaned between customers. Be aware.The highlight was receiving a coupon at check out for $1 off My Mochi next door."
1/31/2016,4,"Simply put, I liked it.I liked the sushi.  I liked my daughter General Tso's.I liked the smaller portions.I liked the people taking the orders; friendly, quick and helpful.I liked the speed of service;  everything came within ten minutes.I liked the interior of the seating area; spacious, well lit, nice.I will definitely return and hope to see one closer to where I live."
1/2/2020,2,"Every bento restaurant in Gainesville smells like feet and or baby poop....I have to eat outside whenever we go there. The food is okay, nothing to go crazy over and the boba tea is also not the best."
9/20/2019,1,Expect to wait for some mediocre overpriced food. $2.50 for a few ounces of miso soup and more than a tablespoon of sauce is an extra charge
12/28/2017,1,"I used to love Bento.  I've been going for years however my last visit killed me.1.  Parking sucks. Which I have been okay with up until my last visit when I twisted my ankle in a very poorly lit parking lot. 2.  New shortened menu.  Took a lot of options off.3.  Soup bowls were dirty when they arrived. 4.  Sushi fell apart, wasn't wrapped correctly. 5.  Taste was off. 6.  Miso soup was cold.7.  Soda machine broke down and I didn't get a drink my entire meal NOR a refund Kills me as it's my go to place when we visit Gainesville."
10/23/2018,5,"One of my favorite casual Asian food place. The line is always long during rush hour so I usually call in my order since I know what I want. Good for both take out and dine in. They are always having something new and exciting coming out too. Beef bulgogi is my bento box  go to. Crunch rolls  with Japanese mayo is also good. If you want something really healthy try poke bowls with lettuce base. I think their milk tea is a little to sweet, but green tea with raspberry is just perfect ."
2/7/2021,3,"My opinion on Bento is definitely split. I really enjoyed this place in undergrad before but recently the sushi rolls I've gotten with my usual order of the sushi combo box have really been lacking. The rolls recently are really small and poorly rolled. I am not sure if its because of a new sushi chef or what but it's really disappointing. Along with the combo box, I usually get the Boba tea, which is always great. The teriyaki bowl is also very good. The customer service is usually good but recently the wait times have also been a bit ridiculous. The last time I ordered, I ordered online and was given a 30min wait time when the order was placed. This was followed up with a phone call about my allergy preference I included on the order. After 25min we drove to Bento (7min drive) and ended up waiting another 30-40mins. I guess they were pretty backed up but a notice or a longer expected wait time would be a lot more convenient and safe than having customers stand and wait inside for 30-40mins."
2/19/2021,1,"First of all it took 45min for my food to get done. Secondly, I got my sushi and it literally was thrown around everywhere. I went to bite in it and my mouth was on fire because of how my sushi was thrown in, the wasabi had gotten all over the sushi so I couldn't even eat it. Never again."
8/16/2019,5,"The food here is always amazing. Bento is by far the best sushi in Gainesville. There is usually a bit of a wait, but it's worth it because the food is such high quality and always done to perfection."
8/16/2015,3,"I've been a regular at Bento since undergrad-- every time we had events in Gainesville, it would be the number one place where we would stop by. My all time favorite fish is the Spicy Creamy chicken/shrimp. It has a sauce similar to Bang Bang Shrimp, but I like theirs much better. I usually get it over noodles or rice because I'm not a big fan of their bento boxes-- maybe due to the lack of flavor of the sides.It's a pretty cheap place to get sushi. I like their the create-a-don because you can pick 3 types of meat on top of rice, avocado, cucumber, and seaweed. It's pretty tasty and fills you up. It gives you the bang for your buck if you're craving sashimi (rather than paying $5 for three pieces of meat). They also have milk teas and boba smoothies, but it needs improvement. The drinks are overly sweet and you can just taste the powder-- pretty nasty really, but I guess it can fool people who haven't tasted quality boba teas."
9/11/2013,4,"Having gone to school at UF, I know the good spots to eat while keeping the wallet happy.  Bento Cafe has always been a staple for me, even now, when I go up to Gainesville for work purposes.  There is plenty of seating and it's the type of restaurant where you order, pay for your order, and a runner brings you your food.  The soda machine is self serve also.When you're done, you can leave your empty plates/bowls on the table and the runners will carry them for cleaning.Bento Cafe serves a mix of sushi, Asian dishes, and Asian fusion dishes."
8/4/2015,4,"Food: Chicken udon stirfry -good size and flavor. Added a combo to add a soda and edamame and also got the ginger salad which was a good size salad with flavorful dressingKids chicken katsu nuggets - this was good with plenty of nuggets cooked perfectly although the katsu sauce was not authentic. It was light brown and weird and my daughter would not eat it. Environment:Sleek, clean, modernService:Friendly and attentiveDefinitely would return when in town."
1/9/2021,1,Terrible for DoorDashers. If you are a dasher PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COST! Long waits that take up entire dash.
11/19/2018,4,"This is pretty good Asian food. It's not as good as pei wei because they don't add many veggies and they are a little heavy on the sauce. Overall, the tofu is really delicious and it's a great dining atmosphere. Would recommend."
10/25/2017,4,"Bento is the place to go when you want fast, affordable Asian food. At least once a week, my roommates and I end up here because this is literally the only place in Gainesville where our food is on the table sometimes before we even sit down! And when you're hangry, that is very. Important. Since Bento is by a lot of universities across Florida, I've actually had the opportunity to try the majority of their menu and have compiled a list of items that you can't go wrong with! If it's your first time there, I highly recommend the fried krab wontons, pineapple thai fried rice, red curry, Korean, or katsu entrees! Out of their bubble teas, I'm not really a huge fan of their milk teas since they are too heavy for me. I always end up getting a green tea or blended ice. My two regulars are either the passionfruit green tea with lychee jelly or the mango blended ice with strawberry popping boba. Oh, and keep an eye out for their monthly specials! One of their fall specials is pumpkin wontons, and my roommates and I love them so much. Definitely worth trying!"
10/15/2016,2,"Kind of feel cheated a little. So you pay 13.25 for a bento box with extra meat. The quality is not really there at all. The dessert is some fried wonton skin with evaporated milk.The salad is an odd ginger salad.The string beans I am not sure are fresh or honestly they feel really squishy.Lo mein is an easy cheat to appease customers.I am also not sure the bulgogi is real korean food, but hey that's what you get for going to a place that has a Japanese originating word. I understand that bento inherently has smaller portions that culminate to a large meal but honestly the quantity and quality don't match with the price. The cashier was nice but the person who gave me my food was rather curt.I know I sound critical but honestly this place is fine if you don't care about the quality then go for it. The service is ok and the food will suffice. I would have given this a three star but that price doesn't qualify this place for fairness. Maybe go next door to chipotle, sorry but at 9 bucks or so you get extra meat and all of the rest that comes with a rice bowl or burrito. Not advertising Chip but seriously think about it.I would not recommend this place."
8/5/2015,4,"I would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends and family. I really liked the food here. I had the yellowtail sashimi and the ginger scallion chicken rice bowl.  It was delicious the portions are quite big, my boyfriend and I shared it since we weren't too hungry. The sashimi I order was fresh and big, the pieces are bigger than some of the places around town. I'm considering coming back for lunch tomorrow.  The service was quick, our food came out wishing 10min of ordering. The atmosphere was good, very nice decor and relatively clean.  I thought the ordering process was a bit confusing for first time visitors. There was no sign that say ""grab menu here"", I just grabbed the menu because other customers did that. The stirfry menu was a little bit confusing too, but the line was long so I had time to figure out."
5/7/2018,4,I come here about as much as I can. I've tried pretty much everything on their menu including sushi. For the price that they are charging they give you so much food and the quality is great. I really love having Bento here as fast food options
3/31/2020,4,"this bento has great food if that's all you're looking for in a restaurant. on the other hand the staff was not friendly or welcoming and made me feel like a burden for even coming in. i've learned to just call in an order so i don't have to wait 45min in the store. like i said, the food is good but not much else really made this restaurant stand out for me. the taro boba is pretty good too!"
12/7/2019,5,"Madison ( manager ) & staff were super nice & food was delicious! Will def return! Highly recommend the ""Caliente roll"" Yum!"
8/16/2019,4,"If there's one thing I've learned about the Gainesville food scene over the past few weeks, it's that Gainesville has tons of fast casual restaurants (think Chipotle except they don't assemble your bowl in front of you, it takes them 10 minutes to make and assemble in the back). Bento is a great example of a fast casual sushi place with other assorted Asian offerings. I ordered the pad thai, which had a surprisingly large serving (lasted me 2.5 meals), and the thai tea boba, both of which I enjoyed. The pad thai was not the best I ever had, but it was decent, and for the speed with which it was prepared, I can't complain. One note on the sushi - most of their rolls have cream cheese, so if you're dairy-free, this may not be a good option. Would definitely return when craving a quick Asian dish - better than Chinese takeout for sure!"
8/18/2017,4,"Bento is a staple in Gainesville! Really appeals to the college student. It's fast and affordable asian food. Sounds a lot like take out but its a step above that, which makes it an appealing place! If you are stopping by Gainesville and craving asian food, this is a great and quick place to pick something up and has a broad selection of sushi and meats that will satisfy any craving!This location is huge, there is a lot of seating and service is pretty quick. My go-to dishes are the spicy cream chicken rice bowl and the surf and turf don. The spicy cream chicken rice bowl is pretty heavy, I never finish it in one sitting, but it's something I crave if I have been away from Gainesville for long. The surf and turf don is nice and light, has a mix of raw tuna (or can be changed for salmon) and chicken katsu, with rice, avocados and wakame. This is another dish that I crave as I love the textures between the raw fish and the fried chicken. They also sell teas/milk teas with boba, but it falls short and there are way better options in Gainesville. I would save your money and not order a tea drink here as their boba is pretty rough and hard. Overall, if you're craving asian food but don't feel greasy enough for take out, bento is a great option. There is huge seating area and it's a frequent place for large groups to meet up and have a meal. I would definitely recommend!"
10/5/2015,5,"Best restaurant ever, especially their sushi. I got the almond joy boba tea with tapioca pearls. Seriously tastes like an almond joy. I got the National Champ roll. Cream cheese, avocado and crab filled with crab scallop spicy mayo mix on top. I also got the Crunch roll. Lightly fried on the outside with tuna, crab, cream cheese and cucumber inside. Highly recommend"
10/30/2020,3,"It wasn't bad but Bento quality has definitely went down, my Krab Wontons were so greasy I took a bite and grease got all over my hands. The sushi was mediocre but my kids Katsu bento box was good. Overall not impressed like I use to be ‍"
12/1/2019,2,"I travel for work so when I am in town. Bentos is definitely the place I head to for a quick bite to eat. Tonight they seemed pretty busy/packed. There were about 6 people ahead of me. Ordered the spicy tuna roll and thr shrimp tempura  udon noodle soup. Had to be at work within an hour. Plenty of time. Received my spicy tuna roll within 15 mins. Started noticing other customers that had ordered after me receive their entrees. I decided to check in with the staff 35 minutes after I placed my order. Asked to put my order for here to go instead. For some reason my order got missed and other orders after mine were being served. Went to cancel my order, before they did so I could see one of the staff frantically looking for my order along the take out orders. They happened to find it tucked away..... Good food, however. Hopefully this isn't a frequent mishap for them."
2/2/2015,3,"Went for lunch with co-workers. Very friendly and informative cashier. Ordered the spicy cream chicken bento box. Everything was good, I couldn't eat it all. Chicken was crispy & hot, not too much spice. Comes with rice, noodles, friend green beans and salad."
8/16/2018,5,"I like this place, food, quality, service and price are great. Beautiful and clean restaurant. I'll be back for sure"
11/19/2016,3,"Expensive, cafeteria style sushi.  The food was okay, very much like cafeteria food, even though it was sushi.  About $10 per meal.  Not sure how poor college students afford it."
8/13/2019,2,"The wait here is ridiculous for such small portions of food to be prepared. Ordered a to go poke bowl on a Tuesday night and it took 25 minutes to get it. My gosh, you can steak prepared faster at a steakhouse. Plus the staff there is very unaware of what quality customer service is. For the money and time you're truly better off going somewhere else."
7/6/2019,4,Tasty and fresh! Would definitely go back. Lots to order on the menu and service was fast. Place was clean too. Kudos!
9/10/2017,3,"Had dinner here. The line was pretty crazy, we waited about 20 minutes however the employees did warn everyone in line how long the wait would be. I ordered the noodle bowl with orange chicken. We received our food rather quickly even with everyone that was waiting. The noodles were good the orange chicken was not my favorite. It also didn't seem like it had just been cooked. It seems like it had been sitting there for a while before they served it."
5/22/2018,5,I love this place. My favourite restaurant which serves the best Pad Thai in Gainesville. Have tried almost everything here and never got dissappointed. Great ambiance and has a great sushi kitchen. Excellent menu options at an affordable price.
10/9/2016,3,"Only reason I wouldnt rate them higher is their lack of gluten free options. Typically a place like this will offer a rice noodle, but there werr only two options. The food wasnt bad, but it wasnt great.I would have ordered the sushi but it was off to the side and did notice until after I had placed my order. Ended up with the curry and the sweet and sour, both were swimming in the sause and still lacked a little flavor. My friends partook in what appeared to be the more popular choices, which were ordered by several other patrons around us, and they loved and devoured it."
12/26/2016,4,"The students of UF are very lucky to have a place like Bento. Hailing from Miami as a gator alum, I was not the biggest sushi fan as a young student. However, that all changed when I met my wife and sushi was introduced as a regular part of my diet.Bento offers very reasonably priced food including rolls, bowls and hot Asian fusion items. After the 5 hour commute from Miami we pulled off at the Bento on Archer. We arrived around 3:00 PM and the place surprisingly had a decent crowd. I opted for a create-your-own bowl and packed it with fresh tuna, brown rice, avocados, carrots, scallions, and topped with eel sauce. I was genuinely surprised how fresh the tuna was. The bowl itself was delicious and filling. I am very jealous that there's not a Bento in Miami although I did hear there was one that opened up near Ft. Lauderdale. The UF students don't know how good they have it with Bento in Gainesville. My wife, a Tulane alum was absolutely obsessed. She couldn't get enough of Bento and I'm sure it will be a regular stop on all future Gainesville trips."
5/15/2015,4,"Stopped by Bento cafe for late lunch. For some reason the line was long. I got the chirasa, we had to wait a while to get the food, but once it came it wasn't bad.It is what it is, which is fast food sushi. It straddles that line between truck stop sushi and a dedicated Japanese restaurant.Given my preference, I'd stop at a Japanese restaurant, but when I would need fast sushi or fast Japanese food, Benito cafe makes due."
9/23/2016,1,Place was busy on a Friday night. Noisy due to lack of acoustic damping. Too dimly lit. Food was ok but not great. Tried the Cantonese pork chops. Too much breading and there were at least 5 big pieces that were just clumps of breading. Worst of all was a piece of debris- hard plastic mixed into the lo mein which I had to spit out. Tried this place once and not coming back.
6/23/2009,4,"I always frequent this location every time I come to Gainesville, because it is so close to where I stay.  It is very convenient, relaxing, there is plenty of parking, and they are open late.  I love the Taiwanese fashion magazines that you can look at while waiting for your food to arrive, which does not take long BTW.  Plus, it is so much easier to park and now Mochi is next door and is addictive.  There are two things that I come here for:  Korean style noodle bowls and Taiwanese Beef Noodle SoupThis is the only place that I have found Taiwanese style beef noodle soup in Florida, or almost anywhere for that matter other than that one time I found it in Montreal.  It is loaded with five spice, delicious chewy noodles, slow cooked pieces of beef, and oh so spicy.  They call it Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup, but I know what it is _really_.Their noodles are so good!  They call them Korean Seasoned Noodles, and they are good with anything on them.  You can also change any of the stir-fry dishes, or bento boxes to a noodle bowl or rice bowl.  I recommend the Cantonese (sweet and salty) Pork Chop over noodles or the Beef Bulgogi Noodle Bowl. We were here last weekend and the bubble tea tasted crazy, like it was fermented or had some sort of chemical in it.  I noticed that other patrons were making funny faces when they were drinking it as well.  I am going to actually skip the tea at this location next time and get it from Lollicup, where they don't play around and make some damn good tea.If I do get sushi here, I get the National Champ Roll.  Their sushi is not so great, and the nori is often so chewy that you cannot choke it down.  So, I only get it here if I have a huge sushi craving that cannot be contained to the point where I am willing to chew some nori for five minutes to taste the food.  The Newberry Road location is notorious for the chewy nori, but the Archer Road location sometimes makes it edible.  Everyone says that this place is cheap, but everytime I come here it is always at least $30.00 for two people with two meals and two bubble teas."
7/20/2020,1,"Every time I come to pick up or eat in (pre-COVID) I get the worst costumer service. When I'm eating in, no one is friendly while I'm placing my order. When I order out, they ALWAYS can't find my order, even when I come ten minutes after my pickup time. And then after that, they forget a side or utensils. So frustrating."
6/10/2019,4,"I was a regular here all through my college years and I can firmly say that it hasn't changed at all! I love this place! You can never go wrong with the sriracha garlic udon noodle bowl or even my other personal favorite, the curry katsu chicken rice bowl! Additionally, the sushi here is always made fresh to order and the staff is​ upbeat and friendly! During busy hours, such as dinner, I'd recommend just calling in an order for pickup on your way there to avoid waiting in that long line because it can end up taking some time. Overall I would always recommend this spot to any friends along with the more recent Davie, FL location for anyone visiting or living in South Florida!"
2/15/2017,4,"Ok so I m split.  Bento Blue y'all kinda drop the ball 3/5 stars bento red! Y'all rock 5:5 stars Blue- same great quality food, service staff however is terrible, (always appear to hate their job, very short with customers and to busy socializing than hospitalityRed- great quality food, clean, fun environment, awesome staff. Keep up the work guys."
7/11/2020,1,"Every bite, this meal became more disappointing. This was the most expensive bowl of chewy chicken and mushy rice I have ever had. Unfortunately, the soggy green beans were the best part."
1/24/2017,2,"This place is an Asian fast food sort of place where you stand in line to order, go to the soda machine to refill your Coke and then sit wherever there's an empty table.However, both times I've been in here, I have loved the atmosphere (very college-y) but was disappointed with the food. I've tried their sushi and one of their noodle bowls and both were not very enjoyable.Service was good both times. Both the cashier and the server were helpful.The food looks much better than it actually tastes. Hopefully they work on that part more because I do enjoy their atmosphere and the food in theory has potential to be really good."
1/13/2017,4,"Out of all the sushi places in Gainesville this is one of the best ones! If you're looking for quick sushi to dine in, it's antastic! I always get the sushi combo box. It comes with an 8 piece California roll and you pick 2 more 4 piece rolls for a total of 16 rolls for $10! I love the value re and spicy salmon. Always fresh and always delicious! Sometimes the extra rolls are a little bit small depending on which ones you choose, but overall you can beat $10! Also comes with Wakame salad and a side dish of either vinegar cabbage or spiced cucumber depending on the chef. LOVE bento!!!!"
3/31/2019,4,"Bento is the easy Sunday night option. Poke bowl for me and spicy cream shrimp udon bowl for hubs. Lots of options, decent prices. This isn't cutting edge innovative food but it's a cheap staple and a decent option for dinner"
4/25/2014,3,"Bento Red (Archer Road location as opposed to the original ""blue"" location on Newberry Road) is pretty cool: Asian fusion cuisine in a fun, modern, dimly-lit and red-hued atmosphere. They offer sushi and a staggering array of pan-asian bento boxes and noodle bowls. I think now they also at Bento offer the Asian sandwich options of their Hiro sandwich shop next door, too. And bobo teas--they also have bobo teas! So very cool concept--indeed, one that now has locations in Orlando and Jacksonville and spawned several other Asian restaurants in the same family. There's a lot--too much--that one can say of Bento, so here's the good and the bad as short and sweet as I can muster:The good:--It's fun, it really is. --The staff are unfailingly nice and very prompt despite an often-high customer volume. I won't call it fast food, but it normally is pretty speedy.--The selection is pretty good: nothing too exotic nor probably that authentic, but a good selection of pan-asian but Americanized items. --Some dishes are quite good: the spicy cream sauce dish and the katsu, in example. --The bento box concept is great. As are the noodles and green beans that always come with the bentos as signature sides.The bad:--The bento box sides, I don't know when they make these, but sometimes super-fresh and other times, actually stale-tasting or off. I expect given the volume they go through, the noodles are made in huge vats and some unlucky someone gets the ones from the bottom sooner or later.--The sushi greatly varies in quality--both of fish it seems and certainly of the chef's skills. There are two chefs--the serious-look Asian one and the tall, really cute, white dude--who are great, but some of the others, not so much. --Several friends claim they got sick after having Bento. I've not had that experience, knock on wood, and I hate to ever mention hearsay in a review, but I've heard it several times and I have had sushi and noodles before both that I felt were . . . suspect. Fish that tasted off. But then again, sometimes I've had great sushi at Bento. You just never know.Folks, Bento is what it is. It's great we have something like this and I know they're sincere in their efforts. It's kinda-fast and it's high-volume and college-oriented. It's possible to get very good food here . . . and also possible to get something (like those noodles) from the bottom of the proverbial barrel. I would try to hit them on peak hours but not near the end of a busy night nor in the middle of the afternoon."
4/21/2017,4,"This was a quick stop made during finals week. I ordered the Bento Box with Beef Bulgogi. It was good. The salad was wilted and the dressing was overly sour. The green beans were good, the noodles dry, but the beef over the rice was delicious. It was marinated just right. I think next time I will just order the rice bowl with bulgogi. The prices are kind of high for the amount of food that you receive, but overall I was fairly satisfied."
10/26/2014,5,"There isn't a Bento Cafe in Tampa so whenever I'm in Orlando, Jax, or Gainesville, Bentos is a necessary stop. A wide variety of options, the menu is packed with affordable and well proportioned cuisine. My all time favorite is the spicy cream sauce with shrimp or chicken~ whatever I'm feeling at the moment. I've also tried the katsu, teriyaki chicken, and bulgogi; all very delicious items. Spicy cream sh/ch definitely hits the spot every once in a while so I'll admit it doesn't seem like the healthiest choice (there are plenty of healthy alternatives) but it's a popular choice!I've eaten at Bentos in both Orlando locations, Jacksonville, and Red Bento (as opposed to blue), all have great service and even better food."
7/5/2016,4,"Bentos is that perfect Asian mix that tries hard to provide authentic Chinese food while also catering to the Western style of Chinese food. I find it to be a comfort food and I was a frequent visitor back when I was a Gainesville resident. Whenever I get the chance to visit Gainesville again, Bentos always comes to mind.The Chicken curry Katsu and the spicy cream chicken are always my go tos. You'll want to get either the noodle bowl or rice bowl as both dishes can be quite saucy so a carb pretty much plays a critical role to balance out the flavors. A point to note is I have had the chicken come to me with a rubbery texture before in the curry katsu so be on the lookout for that!I've gotten the bento box before which comes with a dessert and vegetables all laid out in a cutesy box but in the end, if you're hungry, I recommend getting a rice/noodle bowl.I docked off a star only because the wait time can be a bit excessive. More than once, they've  brought out our food at different times to the point where the last person finally received their dish when half our party was done eating.One last thing, the Bentos fried rice is solid. So if you're feeling fried rice, this could be the spot for you."
6/13/2019,5,"My sushi was fresh and neatly rolled, not to mention, delicious! And the cashier and waiter were so nice!"
5/9/2016,2,"The last time I went to Bento's was in early 2008, at the Newberry Road location.  This was long before Yelp, but I remember the place being average.  This Bento's was not, for the reasons I will detail.    When we got there, there was no one at the register.   So, we used that time to figure out what we wanted.  There were several people behind the register, servers I suppose, interacting with the cooks.  I guess none of them noticed or cared to find out why there was no one at the registers.  FInally about five to seven minutes later two people showed up to man the registers, as there was a line forming behind the four of us.  So we placed our order, and seated ourselves. Almost immediately, my friend's tofu came out.  By itself.  Ten minutes later my other friend's chicken bowl came out.  twenty minutes after that, my unadon bowl came out, and ten minutes after THAT my girlfriend's crunch roll came out.  I have a problem with this for several reasons, the first being that you are supposed bring out all the meals at once.  The second is it shouldn't take forty plus minutes to make a sushi roll.  The only reason I could think that they did this was so everyone got their food piping hot. Now, everyone else's food looked pretty good, my friend said there was the perfect ratio of sauce to tofu to vegetables.  My other friend looked like his bowl was half chicken and half rice.  My girlfriends crunch roll was average size.  My unadon bowl was pathetic.  Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. But there were six tiny cuts of eel on a giant bowl of cold rice.  It was garnished with seaweed, avocado and cucumber, and the avocado and cucumber slices were thicker and bigger than the eel.  Also, when the server showed up with my eel bowl, she didn't offer me a fork like she did everyone else, I had to ask her for one and she never came back so I ended up hunting one down on my own. I think if I have to have asian fusion food in the future and i'm in Gainesville, I'm going to the other location, or Chopstix."
2/27/2016,5,"This place was excellent. My wife has been telling me about this place for years. Seeing how Asian cuisine is my favorite, I had to go.This place did not disappoint. For $9 you get an entire bento box, packed with all the goodies. My wife has spicy cream chicken and Mt. Fuji sushi roll and they were awesome! If you like a little spice, definitely get that chicken! The outside was the right amount of crispy and soft. Cooked to perfection.I had the Cajun chicken box (could you tell we like spicy?) and the fried pork dumpling. I really love dumplings so I was curious how these would turn out. The fried part was great, which is not a huge feat, but what set it apart is that it's packed with pork! Usually these things skimp on the stuffing but not this place!So excited this is coming to Tallahassee because I'll definitely become a regular at this place. If you're near here, stop by! You can get Chipotle any time :)"
5/30/2020,2,I like Bento as a whole but this particular location just isn't up to par in cleanliness. Before the pandemic whenever we went in there the tables and floor were always dirty and we often had to bus our own tables. We just did takeout with them for the first time since the pandemic and you'd think restaurants would be on high alert. However I still found 2 pieces of hair on my meal that didn't come from anyone in my household based on the length and color. Disappointing and gross.
1/20/2017,1,"I have had so many bad experiences here, I think I am done with them. It is a college town, so it stays busy. With dragonfly setting the standard, I would give this place a negative five. I have had good experiences at the Jax bento, so I believe it is this location. Very little flavor, dry, no sauces to add flavor, etc."
12/7/2011,4,"Why don't we have a Bento Cafe in Tampa?!?!  This place is awesome, great sushi and stir-fry at extremely reasonable prices.  My huband and I got two miso soups, a sashimi tuna bowl, and a sashimi tuna side dish for $16 (so cheap!).  My sister's teriyaki rice bowl and fountain drink were around $10.Great for the broke college student.  I am not a broke college student, but I sure do appreciate a cheap meal!  The quality of the food was quite good; I did have a bite or two of tuna that was a little chewy (probably cut too close to the tail).  But all in all the food was of good quality and the portions were generous.The parking lot was packed as most parking lots are packed on Archer road.  Will definitely go back next time I visit my sister in Gainesville!"
6/23/2012,4,"I'm from Atlanta, GA. Come down to G-ville alot for college extracurricular activities. Anyways, Atlanta needs one of these stores up here ASAP! There is a locally own restaurant up here with the same name, but it's a Taiwanese Cuisine (which is really good). People from Florida that come up here thinks it's apart of the same chain, but it's not. But for my review! The food is awesome. Creamy chicken rice/noodle with the fried green beans please. THE ENTREE I always get when I visit. I've had their Bento boxes as well and it's pretty tasty. Price is just right for the portion. I also see that they're a big supporter of UF, which is a great thing to know. They have a wide-selection of boba tea as well, but I've had better. Other than that, great franchise!"
1/1/2019,1,Ordered from here two times and different dishes but still no good. The food is chewy and always has a strange after taste. Very bland and not very fresh.
3/1/2020,5,Honestly a staple of Gainesville. I always stop and grab some to go whenever I visit because it's addicting especially their pao pao chicken!! It's affordable sushi but with quality taste. I've never been disappointed. Sometimes it can get crazy when it's dinner time or if it's game day but that's when you call ahead ;) you're missing out if you're in Gainesville and don't stop in for lunch or dinner #gogators
11/1/2016,4,"We stopped here on our way up to Atlanta for a quick bite. I love the theming, and the many options available. The food was really good-I love my pineapple shrimp noodle bowl. I think everyone loved their meals-and the portions were huge! The only downsides were the long line (but it was dinnertime on a Friday, and they kept it moving) and my taro milk tea was pretty gross. Other than that, seemed like a nice place. There was a small stage in the corner that I would guess is used for live performers sometimes."
8/2/2018,5,"My Asian go to spot! I love their tofu and the fact that I can get it in almost all their selections is awesome. The atmosphere is great for meeting friends to eat and hangout. It cracks me up that they always have some crazy cartoon show on one of their TVs. They always have a long line during lunch and dinner time so it is best to get there before the rush or wait a bit and go after. The service is hit and miss, sometimes it's awesome and other times it is so-so, but the food is always good! YUM-YUM!!"
1/23/2014,4,"Every time I pass through Gainesville, I'd try to pick up something from Bento. I wish we had one in the Tampa Bay area. The food here isn't extraordinary, but it's good for the price. My all time favorite from Bento is SPICY SALMON DOM. I like it because the portion is perfect for me (smaller portion than at  sushi restaurants and therefor cheaper) and it has everything I want in one dish: sushi rice, spicy salmon, seaweed salad and avocado.Just the other day on our way home from up north, my bf and I needed to pick up something real quick so we stopped by Bento. Good thing I called ahead to place the order because there were about 15 people in line. We got the Spicy Salmon Dom, Spicy Conch Roll, Stir Fry Udon and Milk Tea. As usual, I loved the Salmon Dom. First time trying the Stir Fry Udon and my bf really liked it. I did have a taste and I think I might order it next time. I was so-so with the Spicy Conch Roll and Milk Tea. The conch roll didn't have much of a taste and the milk tea was a bit bland.If you're not eating there, my advice is to place your order before coming in. Gainesville is a college town so this place can get very crowded. We were in and out within 10 min. I love that the menu is extensive."
4/28/2019,1,There was a piece of bone in my chicken. Very disappointed. I usually go here a lot but this bone was absolutely gross and hurt my tooth when i bit down on it
2/20/2018,1,Boba milk tea tasted like powdered chalk with some sugar. You can tell it's pre-made mix. It even curdles. Nasty stuff. Big let down compared to fresh flavors of lollicup.
7/22/2018,5,"If you want a quick bite of Pan-Asian/Asian American food with a modern/young atmosphere, then this is the place for you! The quantity is fair for the price. Even though I end up getting the spicy cream chicken rice bowl often; I would recommend any of the rice bowls noodle bowls, or bento box. If you are aiming to go somewhere strictly for sushi though, then I would recommend somewhere else. Bento's sushi is good, but there are better options out there. Haven't had any problems with the service here ever."
1/14/2014,2,"Bento Cafe is an Asian fusion restaurant that I found interesting. Slightly Americanized but still satisfying to the taste buds. I ran into some trouble with the sushi so I advise against that, but I did love the rice dishes they have, with the different noodle/rice/bento box options. There are too many good options to choose from. I've had the Cantonese Pork Chop (3.5), which was satisfying but at the same time seemed lacking... the sauce and the pork chop together was a little cliche. Maybe I'm jaded by fusion Asian food.. Bugolgi (3.5) is also not bad, although nothing special.I had to take off at least 2 stars for the 2 days I spent of my vacation curled up in ball in my friend's bed. Never ordering raw sushi here ever again..."
3/30/2018,5,Good food and good prices. Service can be really fast or really slow depending on what you order. Lines can be really long during prime hours. But you can always find a place to sit. Love the bulgogi beef bento box and spicy tuna/salmon don!
11/27/2018,3,"Either you come when the line is too long or none at all. So hope the odds are ever in your favor. Service is well organized so you'll get your food soon after ordering, that is, if you ever get to order anytime soon. Food is good. Sushi is ok. I'm a beast of habit so my go to is the Red Curry Katsu Chicken Bento box. Would rate 3.5 but yelp doesn't do halfsies."
9/29/2018,2,"The food is pretty decent here, but they jacked up prices on a lot of their food recently and portions went down so I don't really go anymore. I used to go once a week and now I never go. Sad to see these places cut corners and take a turn downhill."
2/2/2019,5,"On a visit to The University of Florida we happened to find this gem of an Asian food place near our hotel. I was not sure of what to do when I walked in and found people waiting in a line and others waiting and holding numbers. A polite young woman who works there guided me through the process. Grab a menu and get in line. Select your entree and there are great choices from Bento boxes, bowls and noodle bowls. I chose the shrimp tempura bento box and a bubble tea. Everything was delivered to our table. I was surprised at the nice portion of shrimp which tasted great. Everything was delicious! If my daughter gets that U of F acceptance we will be back often!"
2/27/2020,5,"Husband wanted something different while visiting Gainesville Fl...looked on google maps for restaurants and came across Bento and wow what an amazing surprise! The food was great, service was amazing, and the atmosphere was very inviting! The kids were happy as they could get Boba tea!"
4/25/2014,1,"Service only.. Still waiting for my food. The guy at the counter was super nice. I was going to tip.... But he shorted my change! I watched him put it in his pocket!  It was only a dollar... He was nice enough to give the cents back. He was so nice until that point (first time here. Traveling. Generally a 20% tipper). So be careful of the Asian guy w/ the guages. Would have said something at the time.. But there's a line out the door and he already opted to be a punk and shorted everyone else (I'm guessing tips in the jar are shared... ) after verifying w/ receipt as I wait I opted to let everyone know. Love yelp: no confrontation just reporting!!!!!UPDATE:: got my food (it's okay... Think chipotle of Asian food) but there was a hair in my salad! Why are these people wearing tank tops, no gloves, or hair nets. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years... Pretty sure they are supposed to be worn. Whatever. I don't live in this town I'll never be back. If you know what real Asian food is don't go here. If you want Asian fast food w/o a drive thru and possibly shorted on change and a little piece of hair in you food go here."
7/15/2013,3,Not too bad for fast food style ordering except it wasn't very fast. More cooked to order just like any other oriental restaurant. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.More next time
11/28/2020,2,The experience was not the best. The young lady taking in person orders was clearly not having a great day. She was annoyed by our questions in regards to the menu. She was also just staring at us while we made our decision as if we were inconveniencing her. No one else was in line waiting to order so I'm not sure why she was so annoyed. She was also annoyed because we did get a drink to go with our meal. They also up charge $5 if you want Fried Rice instead of white or brown rice for the rice bowl. That up charge is ridiculous and uncalled for. Not sure why they don't accept cash but again it's another thing that doesn't make sense. If the young lady fixes her attitude or actually enjoys her job then maybe the experience for the guest would be more enjoyable. Everything we watched her do while we waited for our food was with a face and attitude of being annoyed but the tasks she was being given.
9/9/2018,1,"Food had no taste. Pad Thai, very Americanized, so If that is the type of food you're looking for you might enjoy this. Seems like cheap-college food. Bubble tea was disgusting, worst we've ever had. Was excited to find a new go to take out place near us, but needless to say we won't be back. Don't waste your time. Find someplace authentic."
9/5/2018,4,"I love bento cafe. I have been here about 3 times now. I like their Green Curry and Sushi. I recommend their boba tea, it's a must try. Ambiance is good. Staff is friendly and polite."
5/7/2018,4,"This is a good place if your looking for a quick pan-asian meal. I wouldnt say the dishes are quite authentic, but they are better than your typical fast food asian place. The service is fast even thought the restaurnt is busy often. They offer many different rice and noodle bowls, as well as sushi, poke bowls, udon soups, ramens, and bentos. Bento also has a full bubble tea bar. It is a great place to hang out with friends or family, and it is also a decent price for what you get. With every meal you order, you get a coupon for $1 off Mochi, a frozen yogurt place in the same plaza."
6/11/2017,1,"I don't normally eat outside coz it's expensive, but last Friday night, my husband and I went to Bento Cafe the one at Archer branch to order a take out meal coz I was just so hungry and we were at the area. One of the  crew who took our order, even asked my husband and I if we're vegetarians, and we said yes. Ordered a tofu general tso first, but he said that it's not vegetarian coz of the sauce, so I changed it to sriracha garlic tofu and he confirmed that it's vegetarian. Fast forward, got home and I was happily eating my dinner when I suddenly saw some meat mixed with my tofu! The piece of meat is strategically hidden at the bottom of the tofu and rice! Huh! Clearly, this was intentional! Not a good prank at all! What if I was badly allergic? I never had issue like this before with bento cafe the one at newberry road! I'm really upset and not a happy customer at all!!! For a good customer like me, I deserve way much better than this! This is so disrespectful!"
6/10/2018,4,"Bamboo sushi is beyond expectations! Fresh, delicious and good price."
11/9/2019,3,"I'm always excited for Bento, I love the spicy cream rice bowl. Always so good. I went tonight around 10pm and was super excited that nobody was in there. I got my rice bowl and decided to add some sushi. After ten minutes the bowl was ready. I then had to wait 30 more minutes for the sushi. When I finally asked where it was, it looked like it was done for a while and they put it to the side and forgot about it. My rice bowl was room temp at best when I got home. I will probably stick with the Newberry location from now on."
6/21/2011,4,"First time for me since I was visiting a friend and I enjoyed it to the fullest their expanding and even getting a DJ which is pretty amazing too me ,It attracts the College kids from UF and is their base support of business and is very hectic during 6-7. Their staff is very helpful and friendly their manager Paul I think is chill guy and will help you with anything you need if he is around. I tried the special Hamachi ceviche which was requested by me since I didn't want tuna. That is why i remember the Paul guy so much. I ate their General Tao Chicken too, Holy crap it was steaming it looked and smelled good when they brought it to my table, i think the taste surprised me the most. It was sweet but perfect to my taste buds."
4/20/2017,4,Very good. Walkable from hotel. While that factored into my decision my meal got me to review. Very good for the price. A little slow but that was because of crowd. Popular joint. I had the sashimi. Though I've had better great for the price and the overall experience is worth you stopping in.
5/8/2018,1,This restaurant will NOT accommodate customer requests.  They will be dead all summer but can afford to deny request to sub rice paper instead of seaweed in sushi rolls in the sushi box.  They will do it for $1 upcharge on any other 8 pc roll but will NOT do it in the box even with the upcharge.By all means the 20 year old sushi manager tos her NO!
12/2/2012,4,"Looking for a place to eat in the middle-of-nowhere Florida that has a diverse Asian food menu?  Look no further. I call myself an Asian food snob.  I've lived throughout Asia, and call southern California home.  That said, I am really picky when it comes to things like sushi, boba, and Korean BBQ.  I was really happy when I tasted the food at Bento Cafe, though.I ordered a pretty diverse spread: various sushi rolls, some miso soup, chicken katsu curry, and a boba drink.  Odd to have so many types of Asian food under one roof, and I was pretty suspicious that the food would be bad because of it.  I was pretty wrong!The sushi rolls were enormous and stuffed with fillings. It wasn't mostly rice like a lot of places do.  The katsu curry was excellent - a huge portion, served over bok choy (I know, not traditional), but it tasted excellent. Looking around, most of the other dishes were like an Asian bistro's take on traditional dishes, all done really well.The boba was awesome - the tapioca pearls were perfectly done - not hard or too soft. There were a ton of flavors...even alcoholic ones!I came back here twice more during the week. This place definitely beats a lot of the ""big box restaurants"" endemic to middle America (like Applebees).  Frankly, I was surprised (and overjoyed) to find it in Gainesville.1 star off for really loud ambience, and relatively slow service - but this place is pretty busy all the time from the looks of it.  It also has a full bar, and is a great place to watch the college/pro ball games!"
9/27/2019,1,"Spent an hour waiting for our food. The food was sitting on the counter for more than half an hour with the Door Dash orders. Multiple groups of people came in after us and left before us with no problem. Eventually, we got tired of waiting and walked up and asked if the food that had been sitting on the counter was ours. They didn't call out our name, number, or anything. And it's not like we called ahead, we went to the restaurant and then ordered. The food was cold by the time we got it. The receipt that tells the name of the customer and the food was printed at 9:52, meaning that the food had been ready since then. It's 10:27 right now. Absolutely ridiculous service, and the man responsible was not apologetic at all, and when we went to complain, ran away from us and hid in the back. The manager would not give us his name so we could give a proper review. He was flirting with another worker while our food was dying on the counter. The money was refunded. The manager apologized, and I must commend her efforts to try to make this up for us. Give this manager a pay raise! The worker with the red hair was very apologetic and kind, a very sweet girl (the cashier)."
2/2/2010,4,"Alright, I know it's not fair, but I like this Bento better because it's in a better location, it's next to Mochi, it's newer, and has more seatings.Bento's is decent Asian fusion food. With the Bento box, I get a bunch of slightly above mediocre food, with enough variety to keep me satisfied. So, if you're new to Bento, this is what you do.1. Open the door 2. Look for the laminated blue menu on your right.3. Pick4. Order5. Order drink, Boba, or ask for a cup of water6. Go sit down7. Wait for food8. Eat9. Wipe faceTipping isn't required, but probably appreciated. Drinks are self-served. Private parking lot. I haven't had trouble finding parking, although this shopping center gets packed."
4/23/2010,4,"Visit Dates: 08.18, 09.03 & 10.22.2009Also known as Bento Red, this is a trendy place that is frequented by a lot of the local Asian American college youth. The place offers simple Asian fusion food, as well as sushi and bubble tea.I've had the Korean bulgogi bowl and Cantonese pork culet bento box. The bento bowls offer plenty of rice but not enough meat, while the bento boxes offer plenty of meat and other side items, but only a small cup of rice. The bubble tea was okay, as the tapioca pearls weren't firm, but rather overcooked and thus soft."
5/22/2016,5,"Went to bento on archer and got a phat seaweed salad. Didn't think it would be so phat but boy was I wrong. Anyways, I was kinda pissed that the soy sauce on my table was almost empty but nobody's perfect. Atmosphere was vibing: I laughed, I cried, I made memories to last a week. Plus, Calvin Harris was on so sushi was rage. 10/10 would probs eat again if it was Sunday night and I was on archer."
12/6/2016,4,I have had several dishes from here and they are consistently delicious. Sometimes the food can be a little bit dry. The spicy  Thai curry dishes are on point. I'm not a huge fan of their pad Thai though. Sushi  is also good too! I think their prices are reasonable for college students and I would definitely recommend this restaurant for to go any day!
7/11/2019,3,"They're ok. I went in for lunch today.. I haven't been in a while. Anyway, I ordered my favorite roll, the TNT. I was so disappointed!!! They changed the recipe. It tastes so bland now. And they added some crunchy topping on top that tastes so gross. They need to stop changing things that work. If ain't broke.. Why fix it?? I'm so dissatisfied."
3/24/2018,2,"The food is really not that great, I've tried it several times and neither the sushi nor the main platters are that good. There are many other Asian fusion restaurants in town that will not disappoint you."
8/1/2015,4,"We ordered the volcano roll, kids teriyaki chicken bento, chicken katsu curry bento, Cajun chicken bento, dew the melon milk tea with boba, peach green tea with boba.  Line was long but we received our delicious food quickly.  We will return again!"
8/18/2011,5,"Heaven on earth is at Bento Cafe!  Too bad, how often am I in Gainesville.It's probably the first and only. Not that it's a bad place, I'm just never up there.Bento was so fresh and cool looking, so modern and fun, and the menu is EXTENSIVE!!!!I have been having a taste for sushi and japanese so much lately, it's unbelievable. The location made my hubby and I happy. He got to have his chipotle, I got my japanese restaurant, and mocha our puppy got to hang out with us since there was an outside sitting area too!!!  Best of everything.I ordered a bento box. I love all of the compartments of yummy stuff. It included white rice, noodles, beans, pineapple cake, my order was Mongolian bbq, oh and I love the salad dressing for the salad also.Also, I had a sushi roll with 8 pieces. It had tuna salmon, avocado and cream cheese and their sauce. I do not remember the type of roll it was.  Man that was happiness right there.The best part of it is the price. The box is around 7.95 and the roll was 5.95. Those prices are great for all of what you get!!!!There tons of different teas, and freezy drinks and such. I wish I got to try them, but didn't get a chance to."
1/27/2017,3,"Portion got a lot smaller comparing to 2 years ago. Probably not a smart choice to get a surf and turf Togo, my salmon sashimi was half cooked when it get to my hotel."
1/24/2015,3,"I have gone to this establishment almost a hundred times, and I think it's finally time for me to give the most unbiased review ever. I have had good experiences, and also bad. I have ordered a plethora of different plates, ranging from JB rolls to udon and stir fry vegetables, and consistently, the food doesn't seem to disappoint. Sometimes, the food is bit too simplified for me, such as the katsu chicken noodle bowl ( or any noodle bowl at that... the noodles always taste the same... no special seasoning?) But it isn't inedible or bad. Just not what I would make myself as a noodle-making chef. My favorite things to order are the JB roll and the Chicken Pad thai rice bowl, which is similar to the kind of dish you'd get at an actual thai place with complementary rice. (I'm a fan of Bahn Thai, but not a fan of the price sometimes). The Pad Thai is not identical, but good enough for me to find it to be a suitable substitute when I'm feeling cheap.The one thing this chain location lacks is consistent service. Although the service is fast, and the lines move quickly a lot of the nights I go, I have gotten my dish pushed back in the kitchen a LOT, and have even had my order dropped off to the wrong table. I have gotten my order messed up too (small things: rice bowl instead of noodle bowl, etc.)Bottomline, this is good to satisfy any craving you have for pan-asian food and typical sushi, but isn't the best place in the universe. It is simply a solid choice for the college kid on a budget who wants a large variety of quickly served asian-style cuisine. I find it to be a really convenient option for dinner."
1/6/2017,4,I love the options of what you can order!!! We got a rice beef bugogi bowl which was tasty but wish there was more meat and the meat was fatty. We got the hot lava roll and Mexican roll which both tasted great but took a long time to get. Miso soup was gingery but salty and yummy. Chicken katsu was by far the best thing I have eaten there. Super crispy and moist chicken. Overall price was very good and I would recommend it!! When I visit the town i always try to eat there.
10/29/2017,2,The pad Thai is particularly bad. It left a bad aftertaste like that of stale vinegar and the sauce frankly feels like it's ketchup based.
4/17/2010,5,"A moment of clarity: sushi is like ... DIM SUM!  OK - a stretch.  One's Japanese, the other, Chinese.  Cooked - not cooked (most of it); cold - hot.  But hear me out: each is an Asian delight made delicately.  So as I peruse the menu... ""What's good?"" I asked.  Back came the equally inane response: ""Everything!""  I deserved that!OK, let's back track for background: I trotted the ponies up to GNV last night - al fresco, and flying solo (wife has to work) - at the invite of darling daughter to go see the Shitty Beatles.  So after I arrived safely, I went to Bento where our daughter works for some sustenance before the show.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much.  If you didn't know, Bento is one of these places where you order from the counter and they bring you your food.  Good sushi from an establishment that maybe one step down from a QSR?  ""I don't think so!"", right?  That's where I was very pleasantly surprised.  So when the food came, I laid in on the yellowtail, and tuna, and salmon...too many to list.  EVERYTHING was superbly fresh-tasting - best raw fish I've had in recent memory.  It was all washed down with some unfiltered sake that's a trifle sweet but totally delish.  Big time props to sensei sushi chef Kevin for being so masterful and helpful (and Jason for recommending the sake!)  Kevin explains that the fresh is so fish (I mean, ""the fish is so fresh"") because they're always so busy at Bento.  Judging from the packed parking lot outside and the long line inside at 9 p.m., you can't argue with that.  Kevin ""brags"" that he loves his job - partly because he gets to eat this great food; he says he's never been in better health, and looking at him, you can't argue with THAT either.  This all made for a superb prelude to a great evening at the Common Grounds, where there was a major Beatles love-in going on..wish I could review THAT.  Actually, I think ""I WILL""!  (umm - for the uninitiated, that was the title of a Beatles song :-)"
3/24/2016,4,My boss took me here the other day for lunch. He looked at me strange when I said I hadn't been here yet. What we have been here for 4 weeks or so now and you haven't been to Bento's. Nope not even in Jax I replied. Ok he is hooked on their tuna bowl with some cucumbers and other green stuff. I went with the spicy miso ramen bowl. It was all right but it was served barely warm. I like and kind of expect my ramen very hot. I'm not sure what they were trying to pull off here. It tasted pretty good but wasn't spicy at all. Now thai or whatever they are calling themselves I expected hot and spicy. Oh well it goes in the maybe not pile.
6/6/2019,1,Had to wait in line to be told there was a 25 minute wait for sushi/poke bowls. It's 1:40 pm on a weekday. They should be more prepared. This place is not fast casual. Skip if you are looking for something during your lunch break. Many other great options nearby m.
7/2/2017,4,Make your own poke bowl was great. Sushi was pretty good and so were the boba teas. Gator roll was yum! Ordering was slow but worth it. Will be back!
11/7/2016,5,Bento is one of my favorite sushi places here in Gainesville. It is so cheap for really good sushi. It definitely satisfies the sushi craving we all get every now and again but it doesn't leave a hole in your pocket! I definitely recommend
5/28/2020,1,"was not greeted when we walked in. upon asking for soy sauce we were given teriyaki sauce instead after asking if in fact it was actually soy sauce they insisted it was (it in fact wasn't) , food was lukewarm, staff members in kitchen walking around talking over food with NO MASK ON!"
3/1/2013,3,"Standard chain Japanese food, very tasty and affordable. Waitresses were very friendly. Me and my wife ordered 2 bento boxes and a spicy tuna roll for $24. It did take about 15 minutes to get our food which is not as fast as you would think for a place like this. Good place for lunch."
9/14/2017,4,"I have had their sushi, bento boxes and noodle/rice bowls. I am rarely disappointed with quality or taste. This is a great option for reasonably priced sushi that you aren't going to question the quality of. I recently decided to try their Tuna Poke bowl (pictured) and was very pleased with the quality of the tuna as well as the amount I was given. They allow you to design your own giving you several options for protein and additions (vegetables, starches and sauces). Their Spicy Cream Chicken is one of my favorites. It not overly spciy but has a nice kick to it. I have ordered it in bowl form (with just noodles or rice and broccoli or string beans) and as a bento box (comes with several smaller sides) and enjoy both. Their rolls are good as well. They have a good variety ranging from a basic Cali to the more custom rolls (Volcano, Bamboo, etc) that also have a good range of cost. They do get pretty busy during the lunch and dinner rush times so we most often order to go and pick it up. However the Archer Road location is pretty large and has a nice atmosphere if you are eating there and have a little wait. They also have a small outdoor seating area."
2/20/2017,4,Almost everything was really great.  Had the red curry chicken over brown rice.  Perfectly balanced.  The pork egg rolls were fabulous.  The steamed dumplings were good...just passable.  The Bento box was very good also.  The place could have been a little cleaner.  The atmosphere is actually a little weird...not distracting or anything...just odd.  My daughter had the sushi and she believes it was fresh.  Worth a try.
3/21/2019,1,Waited 30 minutes in an empty restaurant (no line whatsoever) on 2 orders of boba...not sure if I'm coming back but their boba tea sure as heck isn't good enough for me to be waiting this long for. Several staff walked past me and no one thought to ask why I had been waiting for so long. When I finally got my teas they were leaking all over my hands and the bobas tasted old and hard. The cashier who took my order acted like she did not want to be there. Poor customer service all around. I'm so disappointed as I use to enjoy coming here but seems like both quality of food and customer service has been declining a lot.
3/18/2017,1,Had a very long line. Only one person taking orders. I wanted to order sushi but they informed me it would be 30 extra wait for sushi. So I ordered a rice bowl and noodle bowl with an extra sauce. Sure she said. All the tables are very dirty. My one noodle bowl comes out. No extra sauce. Wait 5 minutes. Go ask for the sauce. Did you get charged for it? I don't know I asked for it when I paid. They look through the receipts. I just give them a dollar. Dude I just want the sauce.
2/19/2019,2,"Last time for me at Bento.  Quality has gone down.  Very expensive for what you get.  Fried rice and vegetables tasted like it was from an all-you-can-eat buffet....cold and tasteless. Fried wontons also lacked flavor. Mexican Roll (our go to roll) was not up to par. Again, very little taste.  Gave us the wrong order and had to go back to the store.  Condiments missing from the bag.  I hope  the one on Newberry Road is maintaining its quality.  I'm done with Bento on Archer Road."
8/26/2011,4,Wonderful and efficient!!!!My table was sticky but the ambiance was cool!  AND I enjoyed my meal and boboa tea!  Coming here next month!
2/16/2017,3,"I was in the mood for a rice bowl and this was the closest restaurant to my hotel.  The ordering system was a bit strange and I'm not sure if I actually got what I ordered but it was pretty good since I finished the whole thing.  Price was a little higher than I'm used to (in Los Angeles) but not too high.  It was busy and the wait was not too long.  I did not try the sushi but noticed it was popular as I waited for my order.   I will try again and eat in, maybe explore the menu a bit more."
11/15/2015,2,"Bit of a downtick in my rating for Bento Cafe based on my most recent experience.Plusses include freshness of the food. Also, I would say that their spicy cream noodle bowl, particularly with shrimp, is their specialty. The shrimp are segments similar to their shrimp tempura, paired with soba noodles, and coated with their spicy cream sauce-slash-glaze; the mouth feel and flavor are excellent. Their General Tso's chicken is pretty good, almost as good as the hole-in-the-wall New York style Chinese place up the street from my home. Their spicy mayo sauce, often served alongside sushi, is more flavorful than I've had elsewhere, with ample bits of flavorful spice.Minuses include portion sizes; specifically, if you get a noodle bowl, well over 3/4 of the dish will consist of cheap, carb-laden noodles, and 1/4 or less of your chosen protein. Their $7 or so shrimp tempura appetizer consists of rather small shrimp a bit shorter than and about the diameter, with tempura batter, of an Oscar Meyer wiener. Their 8-piece spicy tuna sushi has a meager amount of tuna and the roll size is even smaller than what you might find in the local supermarket's sushi section, and also has arrived disconcertingly lukewarm; I feel a lot better about raw-fish sushi when it arrives nicely ice-cold. Speaking of temperature, the couple of times I've ordered soup, it's been just barely warm; this after having just picked it up on site. Worst so far has been their disgusting attempt at red curry, which was a lukewarm, tarry mess; the first thing that pops into mind with a red curry should NOT be ""clotted cream"", yet that's what it looked like, I couldn't finish it. In short, there are a very few things Bento Cafe seems to do right aside from those very few things that I find consistently delicious. I'd recommend sticking with better choices in town, like Bangkok Square for good Thai, and Mahzu for their great weekday sushi lunch specials and excellent shrimp tempura."
2/3/2019,4,"My favorite go to spot. A variety of selections plus vegetarian options. I love their sushi, my go to order is the sushi combo box with double Mt. Fuji rolls. You can dine indoor, patio, or take out. Very convenient, and their food is not overly priced."
1/7/2017,3,Not the best sushi you can get in town but pretty good for time and price. Their raw salmon bowl is always good.
2/19/2017,5,Great place to hangout and enjoy some delicious Sushi and Asian food. Pineapple Thai Fried Rice must recommended. Also the Spring Rolls.
4/4/2019,5,This place is really good. It's affordable & you get a lot of food for the price. The sushi tastes great & the menu variety is really pleasing.
8/9/2014,4,"I'm basing my review solely on the sushi, as I've eaten nothing else off the menu. I've gotten sushi takeout here on several occasions and I've been satisfied every time. Nothing has wowed me, but the consistency is impressive.Service has always been courteous, the sushi is prepared in a timely manner, and prices are reasonable. Although this is not the most amazing sushi I have ever tasted, it is definitely good and worth the price."
10/22/2014,4,The Sichuan beef noodle tastes really good. And Taiwan rice noodle is very special. Asahi beer NICE!!
8/20/2016,1,The front counter service was extremely slow. The food came out at a glacial pace. There was no ice in the fountain drink machine. Overall this was a more disappointing than usual stop at Bento for run-of-the-mill mediocre sushi.
7/2/2018,4,"I absolutely love this place and their food. My favorite food is their miso soup, and the bento fried rice with spicy mayo in it, so delicious! They have a super clean restaurant. It's not outrageously expensive, however it is a bit more expensive than other places with this type of food. I love getting the sushi combo box because it's a really good deal for the price.  Getting two 4 piece classic rolls and and 8 piece California roll. I wish that the signature rolls weren't so much though. They have a decently quick service. I like how they can give you a number and just deliver it to your table so you don't have to sit and wait at the front for your food to be ready. They package to-go foods really nicely as well and give you everything you need in the bag with you. This is place is a really good place to go with friends, although the bill can get quite expensive. Overall one of my favorite places to go to when I'm in the food for fried rice or sushi."
7/18/2015,2,"The food menu doesnt have right set up to understand what is going on there . So  u will spend  15 mins just looking for what u want and how u want it . Then the waiting line is way too long so u will forget what u want  by time u get there to order :) .. Then u want find table for u but its an adventure too . Not too many tables are cleaned from costumers before or if they are ""clean"" they dont look clean how u would like .. Food is done pretty fast just we went there with my girlfriend and i get food way before her so together dinner ended that one looked how other is chewing .. I ordered Bento fried rice with shrimp and here is what i get : 7 shrimp with ""fried"" rice .. just bland taste of soy souce . U Dont even know u have fried rice because the soy sauce made it so soft that u think u have steam rice . No other taste that soy and soy . So the vegi or shrimp is like screaming in dark .. My GF ordered Udon stir fry noodle bowl with shrimp and my food and her food had only one differece . I get rice and she had noodles . but taste of Soy all over and little over salty .. But again boring plate for saturday dinner . This place maybe look fancy but need keep up with cleaning and find thetaste of Asia or Japan"
12/29/2015,1,"Scorpion roll is supposed to contain fried soft shell crab. I received lame, shrivels of what might be crab. Called back, they first said I could get an appetizer. I requested the manager. Manager said he would handle it. They sent me another sushi roll. Same infuriatingly poor quality. Left was the first order (forced to eat). Right is the second order. Both Scorpion Rolls, both disappointing."
9/9/2018,3,"Personally I love everything at bentos . The spicy cream , chicken Katsu , special Mexican roll and poke bowls ! But DONT GET the UDON soup! It's horrible . They used to have a chicken and broccoli soup that use to cure any hangover now they have these these horrible soups that just taste like miso . Bring chicken and broccoli soups to al locations back!!!!"
10/29/2014,3,"They don't bring food orders together, this really really bugs me. The entire order should come out at the same time. Other than that the food is good, not great. I'd say average. The atmosphere is lively, good for groups."
3/13/2014,1,"UGH. This place has HORRIBLE QUALITY FOOD! My mom and I got the ""Bento box"" of the tofu curry and the Bento box of tofu stir fry...... Might I say I LOVE tofu... it did not taste like tofu not one bit. My meal came with baby corn and straight up it tasted like canned corn.... so i asked the waitress...she asked the cook.... and it WAS CANNED CORN! ew! I tasted the sodium and preservatives and I dont doubt the tofu was any different. on top of that we both got some colddddddddd miso soup like straight up  COLD. not even warm or slight warm. Honestly the best things on our meal were the rice kripsies, the taken back now HOT miso soup and the ginger salad. and if you think about it....1. Rice krispies: come premade and of course there good....its sugar2. Miso soup: all it is is soup with onion and wakame.....simple3. Ginger salad: Its just lettuce with dressing.....at least it was washedmehhhhhhh i totally regret ordering food to-go when we ordered food in the first place.... we would NOT have ordered to go if we knew how bad quality there food was. i wish i asked for our money back."
4/2/2014,5,"It doesn't get much better in Gainesville!Food (I had the Spicy Cream Chicken + Rice)- Very good!  I'm not a big fan of Americanized Chinese food.  While this dish looked like your typical orange chicken, it was nothing like it!  The flavor was very even and delicious.  I attempted to save some for lunch the next day, but ended up eating it all.Atmosphere (casual)- The atmosphere was great, you can take a casual date there or go in a big group.  Price (reasonable)- I think there were some pretty affordable combo boxes with sushi rolls and sides also that I wanted to tryService (friendly)- I was able to talk to the servers and cashiers while asking them questions about the menu without feeling rushed.  They were all very friendly."
5/19/2016,5,Have to place when we are in or near Gainesville. Love the food! Bento boxes and sushi - yummy.
6/23/2014,4,"A friend recommended this place for a quick bite.  (We were on the run and ordered carryout).  Compared to a previous night of crappy Asian food, I was so thankful she told us about it.They offer noodle and rice bowls as well as sushi and various appetizers.  It's a pretty casual place so the food wasn't gourmet but it definitely was good for what it was.My fiance had the Thai chicken fried rice (or was it the chicken Thai fried rice...?) and I had the basil beef, which was served over a bed of rice.  They were both pretty good, but after trying his dish, I DEFINITELY had order envy.  The fried rice had hints of both coconut curry and spice and everything in it just worked really well.  Portions were pretty sizable for me and I was glad my fiance forgot about his leftovers, because I finished both of ours the next day.  Nom.Will definitely be returning and trying other selections!"
2/6/2017,2,"Pricing: The prices are not bad, but a bit more expensive than some students are looking for. Additionally, condiments like sriracha are not unlimited;rather, you are charged 50 cents for a side. 3/5Food: The food here can be only described as ""adequate"". The curries are not very flavourful or hot and the sushi is just ok. I can't name any particular dish that they do well. Hot dishes are almost always lukewarm. That said, the menu is expansive so most people can find something they like. There are vegetarian options, but watch out as yellow curry has fish and miso soup has oyster.  Bento box is good. 2,5/5Atmosphere: The atmosphere is trendy. Cool lighting, various seating options, a coke freestyle machine. Lavatories are bit filthy at times. 3,5/5Parking: Decent parking is available and location is convenient 3,5/5Service: The service is so weird here. The staff are friendly enough and the issue is more timing than staff. Sometimes the food comes right out and sometimes well... I've had a few times where one person's dish arrives 20 minutes before everybody else's at the table. That is awkward and there really is no reason for that. 2,5/5Takeaway: Bento takeaway is rather pricey and takes awhile (comment on delivery company not restaurant itself). However, the restaurant always manages to mess up the order (putting chicken in a vegetarian dish for instance). Not always nice about getting refund/redo when you call them. 2/5 Overall: A fun spot for a meal with friends. Come for the atmosphere rather than the food itself. Not sure why some people rave about it really."
11/22/2013,3,"The food had WAY too much sauce on it and the line was incredibly slow.  Way too much on the menus (I think there were three menus?) so everyone takes forever to order.I give it a 3 though because with more staff to speed the line up and if I asked for light sauce next time it would probably be good.  Pei Wei is much better though, although not in Gainesville."
11/17/2013,2,"The food was just ok... Not close to the value/taste in food that should've went hand in hand with the wait.   By wait I mean, the 25 minutes it took to just order, while waiting in a line up front.  I'll give a slight benefit of doubt to them because it was a college town and everybody seemed to be paying for one.. However, there were 3 huge menus that were very confusing and it took me awhile to order.  There should have been waiters and just made it a sit down restaurant.  I got a spicy chicken bento box, the chicken was alright, but there was WAY too much sauce.  Didn't like the salad dressing at all either.  The sushi I ordered was not bad though, and came pretty fast."
6/26/2013,5,"I was never really a fan of sushi, but my wifey loves this place and now she has me hooked.  We like to get pick up orders every once in a while after a long day at work.  I always get the same thing- create a roll with tuna, cucumber, cream cheese, avocado and spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo is AMAZING.... usually sushi is so bland to me but the mayo makes it a flavor explosion in my mouth!!!"
10/24/2016,3,"Ordered the 4 pc Florida roll, it was pretty inexpensive (under $5). I came while it was a little busy, three other people were waiting for their orders as well, but it came out in an average amount of time, only took about 15 minutes. The sushi was very good, I wish it was a little bigger though. I would come back to try some of the other things, but I'll probably stick to Sushi-2-Go for quick/cheap sushi."
3/29/2013,1,"-Three menus that only serve to confuse. -Ordered a meal with ""shrimp, scallops, and squid."" Received a meal with 3 shrimp, 4 squid pieces, and a single scallop. -Perhaps the second worst restaurant experience in Gainesville."
12/13/2009,3,"I expected more from Bento, given all the hype. I liked my bobba tea, I did. There was nothing bad about it, it was delicious. As was the bento box I got.The place was packed and yes, it was very loud. Someone sitting next to us was apparently out on their birthday and got the humiliating happy birthday song from the staff. It's a decent place, with more than decent food. Perhaps the freshmen that get creepier and more like miley cyrus each fall will claim to love Bento, but foodies beware. Bento has a lot of word of mouth hype going for it, and I'm not quite sure that it deserves it.Momoyaki, Tatu, Sake Cafe, Dragonfly, Saigon, etc, etc are all asian options in Gainesville. There's no need to go to Bento all the time. But yes, for what its worth they serve up standard food, fast."
11/17/2014,1,"Six words: small portions, disappointing food, no service.This place seems more about presentation and not the actual food itself. The experience overall is abysmal, mostly concentrated on the food, and what you get for the cost. The break-down: I ordered a shrimp bento box. It came with white rice, lo mein, green beans, and ginger salad, followed by four bread crisp-things lightly topped with a milky-white sweet paste. The shrimp was the best thing on the plate. Tender and fresh-tasting... But that's where the excitement and anticipation of a good meal (for $9.25) died.The white rice was warm; yet dry. The lo mein was dry and cold. That was not a typo-it indeed, sadly, was cold and bland. (All lo mein lovers know that it is supposed to be warm and moist...). A few warm noodles were to be found, unfortunately that couldn't even pull through due to a ""day old"" taste that accompanied it.The green beans were warm, yet extremely limp and overall unsatisfying. It had a light butter coating, but it produced no flavor. Some green beans were limp to the point that my fork could not pick them up because the beans had no substance... Very sad.The ginger salad was the complete opposite though: totally overpowering and electrifyingly-strong. I couldn't even finish it (my companion who dined with me didn't even take a second bite of theirs). And last but not least, the ""dessert""... The little sweet crisps.. Not too bad, the sauce was just right. Disappointingly enough though, they measure no longer than an inch, and are incredibly thin. Since the establishment only provides four of these, it barely suffices to be considered a dessert- more-so like a precursor to an actual dessert. Overall, after our lunch was finished (me and my companion both ordered a bento box), we went out to get more food at a separate restaurant to no longer be hungry. $20 will not fill you and your guest up at Bento Café.The atmosphere itself is serene, while lacking the culture-touch of anything relating to Japan, hardly. Its very dark inside, and is not necessarily pleasing to those who don't exactly deem red/black colors to be pleasant to the eyes. Red and black everywhere...very depressing feel to the place, as a few other Yelpers have stated. I will not be returning anytime soon unless their minuté portions and gloomy food quality changes."
8/28/2018,5,"Love the spicy cream chicken and general tsos. The lo mein bowl is delicious, but get the bento box if you want more variety in your sides."
7/3/2015,3,"Sushi with ""fast food"" attitude. Over all the food was good but the atmosphere of a fast food restaurant where you order in line and then deal with a snarky staff takes away from the experience. So in short this is like fast food sushi."
6/26/2015,3,"This was my first time here and it's not bad at all. I had the Tsunami and Teriyaki sushi combos. They are your average small pieces of sushi. Not big at all since they weren't specialty rolls. I also had the Chirashi which is a similar version to the Poke bowl. Just raw chopped up fish on a bed of rice. The sushi was decent for the price. The cucumber lacked flavor and seasoning. It wasn't pickled right. If you're looking for something fast and cheap, this is your place right here. Otherwise, I'd leave a date night to a more formal Japanese sushi restaurant."
9/23/2018,5,"I love their sushi! My favorite roll is the Mt. Fuji roll, would highly recommend. Some of the best sushi in Gainesville for a reasonable price."
11/8/2010,4,"Remember those awesome tall plastic cups with cute little characters on them that you once received when you ate there? Yeah, well sad to say, they no longer exist. *sad face*The food is still good, super packed as usual but those cups! Bring 'em back, Bento's. that is all.I realize I shouldn't penalize the review for the lack of not having *those* cups anymore so...I'm still a fan but barely."
9/9/2016,4,I got the chicken teriyaki and was very pleased with the taste of the chicken. My fiancé also now comes here regularly for their Pad Thai.
6/18/2015,5,Love this place! They have a great menu and the sushi and sashimi is so so good. The prices are great for the amount of food you get  So many choices!
2/19/2013,3,"Bento's has decent food. After trying the different locations in Gainesville and Orlando, it's pretty much the same. The style of food is Pan-Asian. If you're looking for moderately priced food, this is a good place to go. There are so many things you can choose from on the menu including a sushi menu. I could go on and on about the different things I have tried here but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu's. The Archer Rd location recently expanded the location and doubled the size but on the weekends, this place is still busy so plan for a crowd!"
3/23/2018,2,"The food is good though the price is just a tad steep. See other reviews for food review. I've been familiar with Bento for 12 years now and the one thing that is consistent other than the above-average sushi is the consistent delay. The line is often long and there is often only one person taking orders. While polite, this doesn't compensate for their understaffing. The wait for food is excessively long, approaching 45-60 minutes for something expected to be much faster. Manager isn't anywhere in sight and workers don't seem to be eager to work more efficiently. This isn't the Bento of the 2000's or early 2010's. Bento was once the premier Asian casual food of Gainesville, and I hope they can achieve it once again."
2/22/2012,4,"This was the go-to spot for my friends and I during our college days! It's fun, trendy, and affordable!They recently expanded the restaurant into the neighboring office space so the seating area is huge now! The restaurant feels more open and is better able to accommodate larger parties.The taste and quality of the food was still as good as I remembered. There are plenty of choices on the menu ranging from bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, soups, and sushi. You can get a good-sized meal, and maybe even some leftovers, for under $10!Some of my favorite dishes are the Thai Coconut Curry, Curry Katsu, Bulgolgi, Cantonese Pork Chop, and Udon Stir Fry Noodle. From the sushi menu, my 2 favorite rolls here are the Red Dragon and Sonny Side Up. Any of the sashimi bowls are just as good, too! Can't forget my milk tea with boba, either!"
2/10/2015,4,"Went for dinner here, got myself some crab cheese wontons with Chicken Katsu Noodle bowl, everything was really good. The ambiance of this place is good - guess they sometimes have Karaoke too, I would definitely recommend this place for those in the city, if you have never tried japanese/asian cuisine."
2/4/2010,3,"This place is definitely one of the most popular place in Gville.  You can ask almost anyone, they will tell you all about it.  Bento is a normal Asian fusion food place.  But what separates them from other restaurants, it is their atmosphere.  Food-   Their food quality is alright.  The reason why I say that, it is because I am Asian, I have worked in a restaurant since I was 8 years old and I know what ingredients are cheap and are not.  Most of the beef, they seemed to be flanks.  Their sushi rolls are pretty amazing.  The design of the roll is pretty creative,  I mean they have most of the common rolls, in addition to the new ones that they created. The presentation of the rolls are pretty good.  The flavors of the rolls is good too.  To be honest, the price that you pay for the food that we receive is fair.  The bento box does contain a fair amount of food to fill you up, The noodle bowl too.  Overall, the food is fine.  The service is inconsistent because sometimes they forget about you. So it takes them a while to bring food.   The only bad thing about Bento, it is their set up.  Poor set up, because it has line wrapped around in front of the entrance, so It prevents people to go in and go the back of the line.  I wish they set it up to be more efficient.  In addition, people who orders to go,  got no place to stand or sit besides the two high top tables that they have by the entrance.   But the set up is fairly simple.  You go in, grab a menu that is two sided and you order in the cashier and you wait. Kinda like a Mcdonald place.  Bad thing is that it gets really busy and they always need more help because they always backed up on orders. I have not tried their boba tea yet,  I have a high expectation for boba tea, And something tells me, Bento might not be able to meet it. But we shall see next time."
4/11/2015,4,I enjoy Bento Cafe a lot. Their service is speedy and their food is good. The Bento box is a great deal.
3/31/2015,1,"Terrible management of peak volume. Took me over 45 minutes to get my order. It looked like total chaos, and noticed as several other people complained about their orders as well."
2/25/2010,4,"I've been eating at both bentos since they've originally opened . . . and I must say that overall, I'm definitely a fan.  There have been great days, and not so great days . . . but overall, for the affordable price, i'm not going to complain that much.  I must say that my favorite thing to order is the Szechuan Beef Noodle Bowl . . . some times I've had it where the beef is so tender it just melts in your mouth . . . unfortunately last time this wasn't the case . . . it was too tough . . . but the flavor was still great.Their red tea (with pearls) is also quite delicious and is great with your meal or just by itself.It's got a fantastic ambience and it's definitely a happening place!*NOTE* Oh, and ladies beware, last weekend they had a sign on the women's bathroom door saying the lock was broken so as a courtesy to please knock prior to opening the door!!!"
8/15/2011,4,"My Boyfriend and I were in need of a quick, but tasty dinner last night and swung by our regular haunt, only to find it closed on a sunday. While driving down Archer we were naming places to go...Firehouse? A Publix Sub...no we wanted asian...hmmm BENTO? wow, yea we havent been there together ever, and I hadnt been there in a long time. Went inside, looked at the menu, it was all coming back to me. Bento boxes, Sashimi bowls, noodles, sushi. I decided on the spicy tuna sashimi bowl, and he got the Cantonese Pork chop Bento Box. Mine was a generous huge portion of raw tuna with spicy sauce, Avocado, wakame salad, rice, flying fish roe, sesame seeds. His Bento Box came with the pork chop, lo mein noodles, fresh salad with ginger dressing, stir fry green beans, rice, and a cream puff. Both, with two drinks came to just under 20 bucks. It was delicious. My tuna was really fresh and the rice was cooked perfectly. His pork chop was so amazing, and I being his main squeeze took my liberty of trying a few chunks of its yummy unctiousness.I dont know what to make of the interior, its always puzzled me. Sleek, modern, booths lit with a red light, I think we saw a karaoke set up in a corner. Its not exactly ""cozy"" but its not so offputting that I would avoid eating there. We will definitely go back!"
7/9/2013,4,Pretty good food overall. I love the Mexican sushi roll with eel sauce. Their chinese dishes typically have good flavor but sometimes they put too much sauce in the dish for my liking. Nice environment to have a sit in meal otherwise take out is an option and the food is ready pretty quickly
9/12/2016,3,Excruciatingly.  Long. Wait. Was here to pick sushi. No queue at all. But took twenty minutes for the sushi to be prepared. Not coming back here!
1/23/2016,4,"This place isnt authentic sushi, but its a good place to go when your craving a deep fried roll or a bento box."
11/24/2009,3,"Closest thing Gainesville has to Pei Wei (which is far superior).Trendy, popular environment with lighted tables, TVs, and seemingly always busy. Staff isn't that friendly, but food arrives in a timely fashion even when busy. Typical pan-Asian menu, expect to pay about $10 for a meal.  Bento boxes have great variety, but the rice bowls are more filling.Delivery not recommended because the food will most likely arrive soggy."
6/26/2015,4,I really enjoy this place. Everyone is friendly and  Service is fast. Sushi tastes fresh and prices are spot on!  I wish they offered agedashi tofu on the appetizer menu. Love that they serve coke products But not a fan of the new coke touch screen machines. They have a wide variety of sushi/sashimi and noodle bowls as well.  For my experiences here the only thing I think is a problem is the ordering.  The line seems to take a very long time during the ordering process. They teas with the tapioca pearls are very popular.  They also serve beer and wine by the bottles. I do recommend this place. Enjoy!
8/2/2011,3,"We were on a college visit with my son to UF and went to Yelp to see what was good and close to us - so glad we discovered Bento Café on Archer Road. A quarter mile from the hotel, just off I-75, and close to campus.The Bento Box is a great deal for $7.50. You get a little bit of everything (meat, veggies, rice, noodles, salad and beans). The meat portions are a little small - so if you are hungry look at augmenting with some sushi. The bulgogi beef was more dry spiced than it was a wet marinade. The General Tso's Chicken was very good.The sushi is moderate + priced. Not the greatest sushi I have had - but I wouldn't turn it down.If you want something different, out of the ordinary (not a full up restaurant dinner or a McNugget meal) and don't want a huge hit in your wallet, then Bento is the place.They serve beer and wine, soda and tea's."
7/8/2011,4,"My best friend introduced me to this place, and I am hooked. I used to get a bento box of Teriyaki chicken, but not I get the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with extra eel sauce. Their eel sauce is a teriyaki sauce and honestly, I have no idea why it was called eel sauce. Their BOBA TEAS are to die for, but add pearls. The pearls are really gummy and don't really have a flavor to me. My friend and I like to take the big straw that you get with your boba tea and shoot the pearls at one another which is a lot of fun. I like the thai tea and the red bean. The tea tops have really cool plastic covers on them. I love this place and the green beans are amazing!!!!"
12/26/2014,4,"Good prices. Good sushi. I especially am a fan of the Spicy Salmon Don - which is a bowl of spicy salmon with rice, seaweed salad, avocado and roe."
1/16/2012,4,"Got carry-out on a Saturday night. I think we ordered two sushi rolls and a noodle dish. The carry-out sushi was great. It comes with a little seaweed salad which was mediocre but the sushi and the other dish were delicious. I'm definitely going to try dining in here and want to try a lot of the other menu items.Didn't dine inside, but it looked like they were going for some sort of club feel with all the neon lights and decor. Kinda tacky, but if the food is good, I'll buy."
8/8/2012,4,"This is a great spot for a quick lunch. Sometimes there is a long line, but the food always comes out pretty quickly. There's something for everyone on the menu. I'm not a fan of raw fish and always get a cooked chicken roll at sushi places, and the one here is as good as any I've had. Good prices, too."
4/23/2011,4,"During this visit with my boyfriend (who loves this spot from undergrad & grad school days), I ordered the TnT roll.  It was deliciously spicy and the tuna tasted so fresh.Also, as my alternative to boba tea, I ordered an iced green tea with lychee jelly.  So refreshing!  My boyfriend always gets the Dew the Melon boba drink, which really does tastes like a milky cantaloupe drink!  Delicious!"
11/21/2011,4,"Fresh and healthy.  For some reason, people in this part of the country are really into having cream cheese in their sushi - but don't worry, the sushi here is made to order so you can always nix that cream chesse out of there (if you're not into it).  I ordered a special sushi roll and did a 'create your own' sushi roll (salmon, tuna, carrot and cucmber) and it was awesome.  This place also has an array of sauces that you can order on the side (and the spicy red chili sauce is awesome when mixed with soysauce - instead of using wasabi and soy).  The cucumber salad was refreshing as well - as it should be.Florida is a large penisula, so they should be able to produce quality sushi, even if they are inland (i.e. Gainesville).  I was very happy to find this Japanese oasis and will definitely be coming here the next time I'm in town."
10/11/2014,5,Excellent food! One of my favorite restaurants in Gainesville :) everything on the menu is delicious!!
10/13/2017,2,"Ordered the ginger scallion bento box, the rice was the best part. The salad had the tiniest bit of dressing on the bottom. Most of the lettuce was dry. The ginger scallion chicken had only the slightest taste of ginger and was bland. If you want crab wantons, go to Dragonfly. Bento's wantons are doughy and so bad. But hey! At least you get $1 off Mochi with the receipt."
5/17/2011,4,"A good mix of Asian dishes.  Sushi, Bento Box, Chinese Noodle soup, etc.  Their sushi's quality is fresh and the variety is great.   Spicy Salmon bowl is one of my favorite.   Their Sushi Rolls are also excellent and delicious.   Cantonese Pork Chop is also very good. Most of their dishes are under $10.  I just moved from another state where you can't get quality/fresh sushi for under $10.  To top it off, get their Bubble Tea.Service is fast.  Sometimes there are lines to order during busiest hours, but it is not too bad.  They have daily specials.  There are 2 locations in Gainesville, one on Archer, and another one on Newberry.  Both are equally good. When I go to the Archer location, I usually don't get the bubble tea.  Instead, I'll go next door to the Frozen Yogurt shop (Mochi).This place has so much variety that we went there every weekend for 3 straight weeks.  It's a must-try for Sushi at least."
7/26/2014,3,I honestly went here and did not love it. The rolls were decent but I felt the environment was dirty and cold. Though my friend liked it. And the prices are good
4/1/2010,4,"Three years ago if you had given me sushi I would have spit it out. I literally did once during dinner with some friends my senior year of high school. To my credit, it was a terrible California Roll. Why people call them the ""safest"" roll to try I don't know. Maybe if it had been slathered with soy sauce and some tuna it would have tasted better.Fast forward a few years later and I can't get enough of the stuff. Tempura fried, filled with cream cheese, topped with mosago... you name and I will try it. My favorite place, however, is Bento Cafe on Archer Road in Gainesville. They have quick, casual pan-asian cuisine and sushi, according to the cafe's site.To start, the decor is chic and hip without being overly trendy. Accents of red and stainless steel highlight the cafe, while large television sets let you watch anything from anime to the latest basketball game. Sometimes the line can get a little backed up if you decide to go right in the thick of meal times, but the staff is pretty good at moving things along.If you like crunchy with a kick of spice then the Red Dragon Roll is for you. Mixed inside is shrimp tempura, crab, cream cheese, masago and avocado. The roll is topped with tuna and decorated with spicy sauce. The cream cheese melts in your mouth, while the texture of the tempura gives you a light unexpected crunch.If sushi isn't exactly your thing, they do have Bento Boxes and rice bowls that will satisfy any craving. Or try the Katsu Chicken Rice Bowl with chicken deep-fried in Japanese panko breading served with a tangy Tonkatsu sauce.Stop in for weekly specials and new rolls. Bento Cafe also boasts a wide variety of Japanese teas like boba, green, red and thai.*TIP* to beat the lines during meal times call ahead and pick-up your order."
7/7/2011,4,"The majority of my friends love and rave about Bento so much that there was one point in time I went there every Friday night with my roommates. The place kind of lost its glamour to me after a month of that (which might've been because I only ever ordered one of two things on the menu), but I still went back every so often. I don't know why, but this place has sort of become my hangover-recuperation spot. I don't know what they put in their soup, but I swear, I always go in looking like a hot mess and I wind up walking out looking a little bit more like a human being after a bowl. Some of my friends say that their noodle soup tastes salty like it has MSG in it, but I don't really notice. My failsafe dish is always their Szechuan Tofu (mmm!). But in my latest  visit to Bento last weekend, I tried out their A Ramen (which might be a new addition to the menu?), and it's /amazing/. I always, ALWAYS leave with a to-go box because their portions are usually too big for me to finish, but I pretty much inhaled the entire bowl of their ramen. Noodles were perfect, enoki mushrooms were a nice touch - it's not like the ramen you'd have in Asia, but for Gainesville Asian cuisine standards? This is pretty good. It's definitely worth a try!"
5/29/2015,4,"Had Bento quite a few times at this location and it's good overall. Sometimes it gets busy during peak hours but the food comes in a reasonable amount of time. Food is amazing most of the time, service is about average. Atmosphere is great, would recommend for any general occasion."
3/2/2017,3,"Food is decent. Some days better than others. They do not accept call in orders prior to their opening at 11:30. That is pretty inconvenient when you take lunch at 11:30 and would like it to be ready around that time. When they finally answer at 11:35 it takes ""15-20 minutes"" to prepare. Not great for those with a 30 minute lunch."
5/6/2015,1,"The good:-Quick service. If you are looking for a place to grab a quick meal this is it. 15-20 minutes and your food will be in front of you.-Location. Located right next across from Butler Plaza. Parking is a little short during lunch/dinner hours since there are other food establishments nearby. Always stop at Mochi for dessert.-Decent menu optionThe bad:-The staff placing orders do not know their menu well. I ordered the katsu noodle soup bowl but asked prior to placing the order what kind of broth does the noodle soup come in (chicken or fish). She told me I can get it with the chicken broth which was what I ordered. When I received the my noodle soup bowl I noticed immediately that the broth was a fish broth. When asked to fix my order the server told me she cannot because this item only comes with a fish broth. 1) That is not what I was told when placing my order 2) Aren't the broths pre-made? Can't you just put the chicken broth in my bowl instead of the fish one? 3) If you are having a bad day, don't take it out on your customer. -The lighting is too dim! It is very difficult to see with only red lights on. I appreciate the candles in each table but those did not help much. My friends joked that they dimmed the place up so you can't see the roaches that could be crawling around or the other rodents you don't want seeing next to your meal. I am starting to think they got it on the dot with that one. -Not the best in customer service. Just get your food, eat, and leave."
9/18/2014,4,We ordered one sushi roll to go and although it wasn't that busy it took forever!!! But it was worth it. I think I can honestly say it is the best sushi I've had in Gainesville. Haven't tried other food items but the sushi is really good although pricy.
7/8/2011,4,"Bento makes me glad to be back in Gainesville. The one place I missed the most while living in Miami... Hard to find a sushi bowl as good as the Spicy T-Una Don... Thick pieces of eel, plenty of tuna pieces, seaweed and fish roe for only $6.95!  I hope this place never realizes that a bowl like this would be well over $10 just about anywhere else.... but it's a college town, so my wallet is thankful...Their boba milk teas are the best I have ever...period."
9/15/2011,3,"Udon noodles may be the ultimate comfort food.  On a rainy day, these thick warm noodles are absolute heaven.  As far as we're concerned when it comes to an udon dish it's all about the noodles; which was a useful attitude during our recent visit to the ever hip and popular Bento Café.  We ordered the Red Curry Beef Bowl, described as ""a very spicy Malaysian curry dish"", which we found surprisingly mild.  The beef was tender and the vegetables were crunchy but there just wasn't any heat. But who cares, the noodles were terrific.We also sampled the Szechuan Tofu Bento Box.  The tofu in this dish was extremely silky and went well with the mild garlic and ginger flavors of the Szechuan sauce.  The dish's noodles were firm and the beans were crisp but the rice was a bit dry and the ginger dressing lacked substantial ginger.  While the bento box offered a good quantity and variety of food, we think that next time we'll go with a more singularly focused dish like a rice bowl or noodle soup."
12/5/2014,2,"Not a fan of this place. The only good think is the service. The sushi is not that great, they are always super busy, and the bubba teas are not that tasty."
1/10/2014,4,Almost everything I've had here has been good both of cooked and raw ingredients. The raw sushi could stand to taste a little fresher but still beats Publix sushi and the like.
1/18/2015,4,"The food is fantastic, but sometimes the atmosphere detracts from the experience.  The servers are typically professional but for some reason they always put the cranky one at the register.  Also, take-out orders are frequently wrong.  A little customer service training for the staff would go a long way."
4/6/2011,3,"I've dined in and ordered food from Bento since 2006. Their sushi is good, and after a few bouts of trail and error I was able to narrow down my top favorite dishes from them. However, I'd recommend NOT getting the following: boba tea (Lollicup is better), edamame (way overpriced and you're given a small portion), or ANY Bento box (their desserts are lame and the salad isn't good).They have a nice atmosphere and have played some interesting movies while I've dined in (including Up). I'd recommend eating there, but at a random time (it can get REALLY noisy)."
8/19/2013,3,"I've gone to Bento before. I'm only biased with the Jacksonville location because a lot of my friends work there! This bento, well, let's just say they are SUPER busy. On that note, half of my party's food came, the other did not come in until we were done eating. It was mostly the sushi that took forever, but when everyone got their food, they were pleased! I tried the Katsu Chicken Udon. I love Katsu, but I wanted to taste their Udon noodles. I have had better tasting broth, so next time, I think I will stick to a Sushi Bento box or just a regualr bento box! My friend had a side of pan-friend noodles and they were a little cold. We asked if they could heat it up, and they did so."
5/23/2014,3,"Got the food to go so can't speak for the ambience inside the restaurant. Food was pretty decent; not among the best asian food you can get, but really worth a visit at least once. Their boxes are always good options, and you can customize your order pretty thoroughly so you're sure to get what you actually want."
3/18/2014,5,"Best casual sushi place in Gainesville I've been to so far. Pieces of sushi are large and delicious. Many different options, and I like to sit at the sushi bar because the sushi rollers are friendly"
10/27/2014,1,"This review is for the quality of service.  I have eaten at Bento more times than I care to say and was extremely disappointed by the service I received today at the Archer Road location.  First, I was sitting outside waiting for a friend to arrive when one of the employees came over to the table next to me.  The bowl she was going to deliver wasn't correct.  She was confused and walked back in.  A minute later another employee walked out and said she was the one that took her order and that this was what she ordered because she read the order back to her.  The customer said I am not sure but that is not what I want or what I thought I ordered.  The employee gave her a look and walked back inside.  When her friend showed up to eat with her from another restaurant she told him the story and wasn't too happen they were blaming the wrong order on her.My friend arrived and we placed our order.  I listened closely as she read the order back.  Whew..it was correct.  After our food was delivered to us the same employee that i saw confront the customer outside about her order come over to  my table.  I was thinking the order is correct i wonder why she is coming over here, maybe to see if we needed anything and if everything was okay.  Instead she says they forgot to charge me for the brown rice in my bowl and asked me to give her a dollar!!!!  We were so shocked that we gave it to her.  Afterwords I said I should have told her that wasn't my fault and remind her of what I saw her tell a customer outside not 10 minutes earlier.If this is the type of customer service we are to expect from Bento now I would imagine that their  very busy and profitable restuaruants would start to lose faithful customers.  Most restaurants would have delivered the rice bowl and said, we noticed we forgot to charge you for the brown rice and that it is on the house today.  I wonder if this is a new directive from the ownership/management to extracts every dollar from their customers.  We will just have to see.Strike one and two Bento!!"
2/6/2009,4,"Same Bento Yumminess as Newberry Road, but a smidge bigger I would say.  MMMhmmm..."
3/24/2012,2,"The petty charges at Bento have become ridiculous. Overall, the food is decent, the atmosphere is trendy, and the service is hit or (more commonly) miss, but getting charged for every insignificant meal add on has just become tacky.The $0.50 charge for a small dipping cup of sauce is outrageous considering that every other Asian cuisine establishment will gladly give you spicy mayo and Sriracha for free, but the breaking point was during my most recent visit tonight. Upon examining my receipt I noticed that I was charged $0.20 for TAP WATER. Sure, a pretty insignificant amount, but never have I been to a restaurant that had the nerve to charge for tap water.I considered using the restroom before leaving the restaurant, but didn't want to run the risk of getting charged per square of toilet paper."
6/28/2011,4,The sushi is fantastic.  Always has been.  There service is good but sometimes I feel like all those pretty cashiers are more interested in talking to each other then they are getting the food out and servicing the guests.  Maybe it's just been my experience though.  The sushi is so good I'd probably still go back even if the service was horrible.
12/8/2011,2,This Bento location is probably ok as a student hangout but I'm not a student. I ordered the Katsu chicken. It comes garnished with broccoli I mean cold broccoli. The panko bread crumbed chicken was over cooked and served a slightly higher than room temperature. The rice was clumpy and cold.  What really bothers me is the Newberry road location has always been great. They even charge for extra sauces at this location. I'll leave this Bento for the students. I appreciate a more professional food experience. I won't be back to this location.
3/29/2013,4,The boxes are so cute! My favorite spontaneous late night dinner is a box with my beau and we sit outside (archer rd) so we can feed that cute cat outside! He LOVES fishies!
11/4/2011,4,"Good food and great prices! If you're looking true, authentic, traditional Asian food - this isn't your place. This is more of a place where you want pretty good Asian food that is NOT take out, but has a trendy, casual, fast food/sit down atmosphere.I love their Bento boxes and their noodle bowls! They have meat and non-meat options, sushi, appetizers, bubble teas, sodas, and beer. They aren't just Chinese, but have some Korean and Thai options as well.Some of my favorite dishes are the Bulgogi Beef Noodle Bowl and the Chicken Katsu Bento Box. I don't know what type of noodles they use in their noodle bowls.. but they are like thin udon/thick ramen style noodles are so yummy! I love their sauces too. I love their milk teas - taro and red bean are my favorite! My boyfriend loves the Spicy Tuna Don and the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box.My cousin used to work here and told me that they make their sauces from scratch everyday and that they use whole chickens to cut up into different pieces.I no longer live in Gainesville and I have never found a place quite like this. I definitely miss it and will have to visit when I am in town again!I believe that they have a separate section that you can reserve for special parties and occasions. You can always get take out or get it delivered through one of the local Gainesville food delivery companies. It is usually pretty busy at all times of the day, but you can usually find seating (or don't have to wait too long) and the food comes out pretty quickly. Good service from the cashiers and the servers who bring out your food after you order it. They are nice and helpful and bring out your utensils and napkins."
6/12/2011,3,"My teenagers love this place for the Chicken Katsu Bento Box. I always order the Philly Roll. It's pretty good for this kind of food. Great when you''re in the mood for something different but quick. The last time we were there, they were expanding it so that should be nice and much more comfortable although I never felt crowded. Sometimes the sushi is not rolled up as nicely (falls apart) and I suspect it's because it's Philly Roll and not something more exotic so that's their little passive-aggressive thing the sushi-rollers do but hey, that's ok. It's still tasty."
6/30/2013,4,I love Bento! It is my go-to guarantee for good sushi in Gainesville. It's very casual with an excellent environment. It's seriously awesome for just a quick pick up or a casual lunch/ dinner with friends. I especially am a HUGE fan for the Mexican rolls.. yuuuummmmmmmy!!!!
4/29/2014,1,"Horrible service. Unimpressive food. We came right before closing Sunday night and the guy/douchebag who took our order was not very courteous and loudly said "" you have 2 minutes to order ""! He had this pissed look in his ugly face because he appears to hate his job. My friend who was from out of town had some questions which the cashier was none too happy to acknowledge. Take your business somewhere else. Don't come here. Not worth your money."
5/5/2012,4,"My boss told me about this place so I had to check it. I was not disappointed! I got the Green Boba Tea with Black Pearls for a drink and the Pad Thai Noodle Bowl. The drink was yummy, sweet and the pearls added another sweetness I cannot describe but definitely a light refreshing drink. The bowl was huge and very very tasty! Lots of chicken, not too spicy and the noodles were done perfectly! I'm so glad there is a Bento up in Jacksonville so I can become a regular. Next time I'll definitely try the sushi."
3/20/2014,5,"Bento Cafe is an excellent place in Gainesville to stop if you're craving some sushi. Staff is very friendly, place has nice atmosphere and food is excellent."
3/15/2018,5,yes sometimes i want to cry how long the lines is but the food is so good that its worth the wait. takes long but sushi!!! learn to have patience anyways. best quick sushi in gville
4/2/2013,5,I love this place! There are so many options and everything is so reasonably priced! I get one rice bowl and it lasts me two full meals. They're decently quick but you can call ahead if you're in a pinch!
12/22/2010,2,"Service wasn't the best. The cashier girl was a ditz, she didn't even think to give us our ticket order to pick up our food later. The fish was not fresh. I had a stomach ache that night =X"
4/19/2013,4,I was out shopping on Archer and had a sushi craving. I knew this place was a chain but wanted to give it a try anyway. I played it safe and ordered the spicy tuna roll. It came out super fast and was quite tasty. The restaurant was packed yet they had a whole other area roped off people could have been sitting in since it is seat yourself. Next time I would order a box or bowl they looked really good.
9/25/2015,4,"Great sushi, I recommend the hot lava roll (shrimp tempura, white escolar, delicious crab meat on top). My favorite bento box is the spicy cream chicken. Four stars instead of five because sometimes the chicken is very heavily breaded and there will only be a little bit of chicken in the middle. The cream is very good, and the bento boxes are reasonably priced (come with rice, noodles, ginger salad, string beans, and a dessert)."
8/4/2012,3,"After reading 4 star reviews on Yelp I tried Bento Cafe for delivery. When I called I was told to google ""2 dollar delivery"" to place delivery orders. This was pretty easy and offered options to custom order the food. I wanted sake with my order but no alcohol could be ordered on the web site.The Chicken Thai Coconut Curry  (noodle bowl) was very bland, with overcooked noodles, that were just mush when eaten. A little salt and pepper would have been good, however there was a nice hint of coconut in the milk / cream style sauce. The ""Crunch Roll"" sounded good but barely any tuna or cream cheese in the roll, it was mostly the fake ""Krab"" and tasted like it. The Panco breading was a different approach than the usual Tempura and was pretty good as a breading. The green tea with pearls....not quite sure what the pearls are but they are like chewing a small black gummy bear. The green tea flavor itself, was quite good one of the better I have tasted.Disappointing after all the good reviews, but a little better than most places. A little more seasoning and not skimping on the tuna and cream cheese in the roll and this place would have got 4 stars, but just 3 for now."
8/16/2011,5,Donburis are the best and you really get your money's worth. I'm always stuffed when I eat those sushi or entree rice bowls! I miss being in Gainesville...
1/1/2013,1,"Yuck. This is the worst Asian food we have had since moving here.Unless you have NEVER had decent Asian food, skip this place or be prepared for disappointment. Besides the annoyingly slow ""pre-pay at the cashier"" type of service, they serve up terrible-tasting, overpriced food. The only thing that was just OK was the sushi rolls which tasted at least fresh. The Boba tea tasted like powdery paste (tried 2 different flavors to be sure it was really as awful as the first). The noodle bowls were watery and underseasoned, I have had better curry from a frozen packet at home. The ambiance is one of the worst parts of the experience here, unless you like blaring techno music and cheesy 1990's light-up booths with dirty tables."
7/17/2011,3,"The Thai tea with Pearls here is the only reason it will ever be acceptable for me to get off at the Gainesville exit. But, I have made a trip off the highway JUST because. Definitely worth a try if you're (unfortunately) local."
6/28/2011,4,"I love Bento because the prices are reasonable and everything tastes great! My favorite dishes are General Tsos Chicken, Bulgogi Beef, Spicy Cream Chicken, Spicy Korean Chicken, and the Spicy Salmon Don! Boba tea is also yummy!"
7/7/2011,5,Amazing Asian food and the bobo tea is to die for my only complaint is there too close to work so I eat here too often.
8/3/2014,1,"The customer service at this restaurant is horrible. I called them to make a to go order and they had me on hold for 20 minutes. They didn't even put the phone on hold, they put the phone down so I was able to hear everything that was going on and no one acknowledged the fact that there was a phone sitting off the line. when someone finally answered they phone they didn't apologize for the hold so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager was extremely rude and tried to explain that they are backed up but that doesn't give any excuse to put me on hold for that long. They could have at least had the decency to pick up the phone and keep me abreast of what's going on for why I'm waiting so long, or they could have told me when I called that it will be a long hold. They were not helpful at all. I ended up making an order with the Bento off of newberry."
8/11/2011,4,Love me some bentos. Great food great atmosphere. Only a 4 star because it is a chain.
2/26/2012,4,The prices where really good for the quantities you get. The sashimi was actually really fresh and tasty and the coconut Thai curry bento box I had was good too. The only thing I don't like is that you don't know what to do when you walk in. Sit? Order? Wait to be seated. A little vague.
12/12/2012,4,"Everyone in Gainesville knows this place! Its the best hang-out spot for college students. Food is affordable and great (most of the time), Parking might be harder to find during the weekends, you will just have to hunt."
9/4/2011,3,"Went for lunch on Wednesday.  I ordered the shrimp tempura. The wait was pretty long, especially since there were only two people ahead of me and only four tables/booths occupied. The decor is interesting...would probably start to bug me if I dined in. Anyway, finally got my to go order and took it back to work. When I opened the box, my heart dropped just a little. Why would they call it tempura when it was panko battered? Don't get me wrong now. They were cooked perfectly - for panko battered shrimp. It just wasn't tempura and that was what I was expecting. The green beans were yummy. Polished those off pretty quickly. The rice was too sticky for my taste. And I never did figure out what the little muffin was all about. Anyway, will go back again and try something different. Maybe I should have given them 4 stars instead. Let's call it 3.5 for this visit."
1/14/2013,4,"Great, quick sushi! I've never had a roll that I didn't like at Bento, and I've been going there for 5 years. Their noodle soups and bowls are also delicious. Plus, it won't break the bank - prices are pretty reasonable."
5/7/2011,4,This is actually a really good place for sushi in Gainesville. It is very reasonably priced for what you get. And they were playing great music when I was there.
7/30/2011,2,"Bento used to be my go-to place for fast sushi and sushi bowls...now its gotta be Bento Blue.  Bento Red is on Archer Rd, while Bento Blue is on Newberry.  I put off going to Blue because I wasn't a fan of their loud, abonoxious techno music...but their service is faster and friendlier.  Their sauces are all free (no up-charge).  They have daily specials! The parking lot wasn't completely full! But really, Bento Red still deserves a spot somewhere...prices are still decent. I'd drive the extra few miles for Blue."
12/7/2012,4,"The food is pretty good. It's a good place to go that is priced well and gives good portions. Their bentos and noodle bowls are both pretty good. It's not ""authentic"" but it  comes out quick and is good. The decor is well done to look trendy with a red and black theme. Good place to go to grab a bite with some friends."
9/27/2009,3,It is a little expensive for the quality. But I still like it. The noodle soup and bento is their best. My favorite is teriyaki bento box. Sushi is average.Don't forget try their pearl tea.!!strong recommend. The environment there is fine.
4/14/2015,4,"ate lunch here recently and the spicy tuna roll was really good, place was clean, service fast and food good, what more can u ask for?"
9/2/2011,5,I love the Bento box so much! The duck meat is great!
7/24/2012,4,"First, their food is delicious. Their sushi is comparable to if not better than sushi at far more expensive restaurants, and their Red Dragon roll is one of my favorite sushi rolls anywhere. The bento boxes are delicious, and their red curry is especially superb. (I recommend getting a bento box over a rice bowl or noodle bowl--I find both of those to always be a bit lackluster).  They have a great menu with very reasonable prices and they are vegetarian-friendly as well.So why only 4 stars? Though they've gotten better in the last year or so, the servers can be a bit snotty. I had a problem with an order and even the manager was not at all accommodating (long wait, wrong dish, etc). Still, as I say, it's gotten better if still not perfect.But the main reason they lose a star is all the charges for extras. Don't want soda? You have to pay for a water cup. Your food comes with spicy sauce but you want a little more? That'll be 50 cents, please.  Substitutions? There will be a charge.  They enforce these vigorously too--they will run your credit card for a quarter. Their food prices are reasonable, but it's very tiring to be nickel-and-dimed on any extras, especially if you just want to try something. The other Gainesville location on Newberry Road does not charge for these extras."
12/24/2014,2,"I love Bento but this particular one is not a good location.  I am not a picky customer and am usually happy with just about anything, but my food has been awful every time I've visited,the last time I ordered a rice bowl and it was extremely salty and was all rice and just a few pieces of meat or veggies.  At the Bento's on Newberry Road it's done right and more balanced.   Bento concept is great but this particular one falls short in execution."
1/11/2014,4,"""Bento Red,"" as they call this location, might be a little bit better than the original ""Bento Blue."" I do not visit this location nearly as often, but when I do, it's usually a better experience. At Bento Red, the restaurant is a lot bigger, so the staff provides you with a number to sit on your table so they know where to bring your food (rather than at Bento Blue, where they just seem to be good at paying attention to your face, but I don't know if that's really how they do it!) Whenever I go here, it's usually pretty busy, but not so much that it takes longer to wait for my food than it does to enjoy it. The food here seems to be a lot more fresh and consistent than at Blue, and the menu is a little bigger with a bit more variety as well (mostly, they have some desserts!) The biggest advantage of Bento Red is its location; it's right on Archer Road and in the same strip as Mochi and Hiro, where you have even more delicious dessert options."
5/28/2011,4,"I really like this restaurant!!! I love the yellow curry rice bowl, the bento boxes are kind of bad.... I also love the boba teas because the pearls in them are genius! I also love to get the Dragon Roll sushi roll! overall a great restaurant!!!"
9/19/2012,4,"Great sushi spot. Bubble tea was pretty good for trying it my first time as well. Took my girlfriend here for lunch one day, loved the ""Bento Box"" and will definitely be back for the good food and service."
2/27/2014,3,"The sushi is great, but don't get the spicy cream noodle bowl. Whether it be chicken or shrimp it's upset my stomach both times.  When I had the chicken I assumed it was just less than satisfactory meat. However, I just gave it a second chance and I feel even more sick than I did last time."
3/18/2011,4,"This review is probably most helpful for non-sushi eaters, since I don't eat sushi and know nothing about the sushi here... but I hear it's good. Anyways, the bento rice bowls are very good. I usually get the teriyaki beef or chicken, which is much better than most places. The rice bowls come with string beans, which are very good and crispy. These bowls are huge, and WILL fill you up. Don't get the boba tea here though, it's not good and there are better places. The parking for the restaurant really sucks, and if it's packed, it is such a hassle to find parking. I do love how it's located next to mochi's though, so dessert is already figured out. There aren't many seats available sometimes, but I hear they're expanding (and they might have already expanded...) And it's nice to order and sit down at a table, and have them bring the food to you. One last note, the line usually seems long but goes very fast, so don't get intimidated or annoyed by the appearance of the line."
9/16/2011,5,"i LOVE this place. great food and good prices. you can pretty much order anything you can think of. usually busy, but totally worth the line. i think we end up going at least once a week. my favorite are the rice bowls, but they have noddle bowls, bento boxes, sushi, basically everything. the PERFECT college dinner night"
9/25/2013,2,"Not family friendly. There are no changing tables in the mens or womens bathrooms. The food quality has gone down hill, the chicken was dried out and old looking defiantly not fresh."
5/14/2012,4,Great simple fresh food.  Enjoyed a bento and boba tea.  Easy access from 75.
10/23/2012,4,"Great prices are what always draw me back. I usually order a Bento box, and it's almost always the Spicy Cream chicken (so good!). The box has a good variety of veggies, noodles, rice, and meat, and is reasonably priced."
6/3/2013,1,Very poor customer service. Would not recommend at all. A bunch of college kids running the place like a frat house.
4/25/2013,1,Bentos is made for those without taste buds.  It is like Dragonfly but for those who can't afford as much.  It is extremely disappointing.  I ordered a curry chicken and it tasted like a chicken with Chinese vegetables with curry powder mixed in.  I have never had curry chicken without a curry sauce.  It is always crowded with people who just want to be seen and have the taste buds of bottom suckers.  Its awful.
3/22/2010,1,After a few times there and being 100% unsatisfied...I am officially never going back. Other options in Gainesville that blow this place out of the water. I don't know what people see in this place....
1/23/2022,5,"I did it - I ordered via Bentos Cafe's mobile App and carried it out with no wait time. (The App told me it would be ready in 30mins, but I arrived within 15mins, and it was coming out of the kitchen.)I've been to Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi on Newberry Road many times. Appetizing fast pan-Asian food with a good variety for vegetarians, sushi-lovers, or meat-lovers alike. I like that this location has plenty of outdoor seating. But on these raining cold days, I wanted to stay in, too lazy to cook, and I wanted easy to order. I enjoyed a classic, a Rice Bowl with chicken at the comforts of my home, and the price and portions were plentiful. Don't forget to ask for sauce! Based on experience, you must ask for them to get some."
12/15/2021,3,"Early dinner after Gator game, was trying to decide on something quick and fairly healthy.Decided in build a poke bowl since there would be options for some raw veggies.Got teriyaki, salmon, avocado, onions , diced mangos, mushrooms and kimchi over a bed of rice.Overall the meal was good, just the mango and salmon was a little old definitely hindered the experience.Will drop back again next time in town!"
7/27/2021,2,"I used to be the biggest Bento fan (OGs will remember spicy cream chicken, #TBT) but it seems like it has gone downhill recently. This store is honestly THE WORST for takeout orders (I'm talking Uber Eats, online orders for pickup, all of those). I recently had two orders in a row where I ordered online and went in store to pick it up and had to wait 20+ minutes past my wait time. One of those times the young lady immediately told me that it was because they gave my pick-up order to an Uber Eats driver by mistake, but they didn't put in a remake of my order until I arrived at my pick-up time...?! Anyway, I digress. I ate in the restaurant last night and the staff was friendly. I was a bit shocked at how expensive it has gotten ($45 for two chicken noodle bowls and two boba slushes??). We were not at all impressed with the honey boba, which we were super excited to try, but the strawberry slush with strawberry popping boba was good.The Pao Pao chicken is the only reason I still come here, honestly. It's good. My fiance had the teriyaki chicken and it was just okay - it was gristly and he had a few pieces with little shards of bone that he had to spit out. Our noodles (udon, lo mein) were okay. The little green beans are so good. They run some good specials (BOGO Boba and $3 off teriyaki rice bowls on Tuesdays, sometimes other specials via email) where the food is worth it, otherwise, it's just 'meh' at full price. I reached out to Bento on Instagram and Facebook to find out if these specials were still live (as to not clog the phone lines for people placing orders) and never got a response, but they do have a sign in the restaurant on Newberry road showing that they are. Overall - we were disappointed.Update: Was asked by a business employee to reach out via email, emailed on 8/12, and still haven't heard back."
1/15/2022,5,"Bento is my go to for good, reasonably priced sushi. The service is okay, nothing special but it isn't bad either. I always get the sushi combo box, which features your choice of two 4-piece sushi rolls from a list and an 8-piece California roll. I get the special Mexican as my two 4-piece rolls and usually pair it with the spicy Mayo. It's always delicious every single time!! The shrimp on top of the special mex is my favorite! I love to sit outside in a sunny day and soak in the rays while enjoying my sushi. I'll forever be a customer of Bento!!"
4/6/2022,1,Zero stars. My chicken was literally raw. Hoping I don't get food poisoning. Quality has plummeted.
8/7/2019,5,"I'm a little obsessed. But why not? They're convenient and there's outdoor seating and if I'm feeling cash strapped there are entire meals I can get for $6-$8 (kids' chicken katsu box or the mini poke bowl--including the really flavorful and tender Asian Cajun Steak option!) Another fave of mine is the bamboo roll, which is pretty satisfying bc it has fried elements.I just love coming here for a raw fish fix or to curl up with a book and zone.Don't really know what else to say but check out the pictures."
7/28/2021,2,"Cashier girl had an attitude since we came in and expected just friendly service and maybe recommendations since we aren't familiar with menu. Apart from sad service which I see from other reviews as well , sushi was chewy and not the good kind.. hard to swallow."
11/11/2019,3,"We stopped in for a few appetizers to hold us over while we waited for a table at a nearby restaurant. Quick takeout place with at least 10 tables inside and quite a few tables on the patio area. A few of the tables needed to be cleaned off but overall the place was clean.We ordered spring rolls, egg rolls, fried dumplings and two beers. We had to eat inside because alcohol is not allowed on the patio. Food was brought to our table rather quickly. I did notice many people around us ordering noodle bowls and they looked good. Next time we are in town I will try it out."
7/23/2021,1,What happen to this place??!! It used to be such a fun spot to get a quick bite and great boba. Now it's just sad and dirty.
6/18/2018,3,"Bento, bento, bento. That's all any college kid talks about so I decided to stop by and check out the hype.I came here on national sushi day and expected the place to be crowded since they were giving out your choice of a free Mexican roll, Tempura roll, or a chicken roll. (Need to be subscribed to email list)I ordered the Mexican roll, Rainbow roll and two milk slushies. The roll was good but nothing out of the ordinary. Same with the rainbow roll. Very average.The ""Dream"" which is a mixture of a coconut and taro was very diluted and tasted like an original milk tea.The basic taro slushy on the other hand was delicious. I would definitely come back for it. If you like taro you'll like this slushy. The taste of taro is very strong.Customer service is excellent. I was considering giving this place a 4/5 just because of that aspect but the food was too average to justify. 3.5/5P.s. I have noticed Bento has a lot of deals throughout the year. If you want to stay in the loop I advise you to subscribe to their newsletter or follow them on Facebook."
8/21/2021,2,This place is the worst bento I had.The crunch roll was just rice and little bit of amount the tuna. Interesting is tuna still have the skin on it. Sushi chef like beginner.
1/24/2022,2,The ability to think outside the box from employees at this location is lacking. Asked for brown rice in my bowl (which they have) and was told they couldn't do it in the bowls. So they gave me the bowl with no rice and a side of brown rice while charging me over $17 for the order. Cashier was also extremely rude. Will go to the other (better) bowl place in town next time...yes it's Bolay!
6/25/2021,1,My phone has a small issue where it sounds like I'm talking on speaker phone even when I am not. Called in to make an order and got hung up on because they said i was on speaker phone. How hard can it be to take an order through the phone? I know it doesn't sound perfectly but I speak with people everyday and have never had issues with them not understanding what I'm saying because there is a small imperfection with the sound of my voice.  Called the other Bentos location and made an order without an issue.
5/27/2021,3,"Bento's used to be a local pan Asian sushi place with consistency and quality. The quality, consistency, and value have all deteriorated in the last several years or maybe my tastes have changed."
11/28/2019,5,"Bento is one of my favorite restaurants in Gainesville. On my most recent trip, I ordered the Spicy Cream chicken (which I think is their most popular sauce) with lo mein and it was so good. My friend had the the tofu with orange sauce and udon which she thought was a tad bit too sweet since tofu and udon both just taste like whatever sauce you put them with, but she still really liked her meal. We both had enough leftovers for a second meal. At bento, you can pick to have a rice bowl (white or brown) with your choice of chicken, tofu, steak, and shrimp and any of their sauces. You can also have a noodle bowl with either lo mein, udon, or ramen or a bento box. I always choose the noodle bowl and I'm always satisfied. You can also order sushi from here and I've heard it's really good but I have never tried it. I probably will soon though!"
4/27/2021,1,"I have tried to eat here several times due to it's convenient location. I have never had a good experience here. The food is either incorrectly prepared (completely different from what I ordered) or the employees who take the orders are extremely condescending when asked simple questions. I won't be returning, and I will be telling everyone I know not to frequent the establishment either."
9/8/2020,2,"So disappointed..asked for food to be a little spicer..it was so hot it was inedible..no one will answerWhat a joke! Couldn't even eat because it taste awful..I like hot food but this was almost intentionally terrible..won't be going back.Last time it was subpar and this time it's a waste of money.Tried to call them three times and I get no answer.I guess a review is necessary since I can't give them the opportunity to fix the issue.Normally,I would give a business the chance to make it right but how can I?"
10/5/2021,2,"So, I used to love Bento. I've been a fan for years, but here lately it's definitely not the same. Not only have the prices gone up significantly, but the quality has gone down. I'm pretty positive the white sauce is store bought now, or at least it was tonight (it's awful). The food is still good, but it's definitely not worth it when the prices increase every couple of months and you don't get the old school bento you're craving. Guess I'll be making my own bento, since that's much cheaper and they use store bought stuff you can get at Publix anyway"
10/4/2018,5,"Ugh. Bento will forever hold my heart. The cream puffs are to die for and the service is always enjoyable. This is similar to a Panera where you order up at a counter and your food is brought to you shortly after. The lunch rush can be busy but trust me, the line goes by quickly! I've also been known to order sushi to-go and bring it to the theater next door or grab some Coldstone as dessert after. The location is great and so is the food!"
11/11/2020,1,"They are the Taco Bell of Asian food, the food was quite flavorless except for my chicken all 3 of us were very unsatisfied and ended up going to another restaurant to eat. The sushi rolls my daughter ordered were very small. The only plus to the place was they actually made people wait outside to get there to go orders and only allowed one customer in at a time requiring a mask be worn. The cheap ramen noodle soups you get at any grocery store has better flavor then what you will get here."
11/21/2017,1,"Disclaimer: LOVE the Bento Cafe on Archer Rd- been going to that location since 2009 and they definitely taste better.Came to this one on Newberry for the first time a couple weeks ago. Ordered my usual Red Curry white rice bowl. 1. Took way too long. Over the phone, the lady said it would be 15-20 mins but it ended up being about 25-27 mins till I got my order.2. They have other locations but the chefs seem to be different at each one... cause the Red Curry I got here was completely off compared to the other places. More veggies than meat and the curry wasnt spicy at all, didn't taste much like anything in my opinion.3. Its a lot smaller of a restaurant, inside a huge plaza, and far down from the highway exit."
12/7/2020,2,"My gf and I went to this location just to get a Thai tea and a slush/smoothie honeydew milk tea with boba. The entire time we were waiting this dude that had DoorDashed had been waiting for a while and quite patiently. After several times of coming back in to check 5-10 min intervals, he was waiting outside and the staff was snickering and quite dismissive of him to the point that he straight up left. Like 2 mins after he left we received our drinks. They gave me an iced honeydew milk tea instead of a smoothie/slush. After seeing what we had seen we decided to just leave it because to be honest this isn't the first time something has happened with bento. Food is decent but wait and service can be crap. Typically we door dash bento if we get it so as to not deal with this type of issue."
11/27/2017,4,"This is the original Bento Cafe location. It is significantly smaller than the one on Archer Road. It is quick service Asian food. They have rice bowls, noodle bowls, poke bowls, bento boxes, and sushi rolls. You can choose from chicken, beef, pork, and tofu as a protein. The kitchen entrees are a good size, but the sushi rolls are not filling in my opinion. Price is typically $10+."
6/9/2021,1,I used to love Bento but the service and quality of food has dropped severely. I ordered a chicken and shrimp pao pao bowl. There was so much sauce it made the noodles under it soggy. They offered to remake it but I had already had 2 full spoons of sauce/soup and had lost my appetite. Never again.
6/10/2017,5,"Never fails to make me smile! I've been coming here for over ten years and the food is always so fresh! I love the Red Dragon without cream cheese, salmon sashimi, and udon noodles. Hubby loves the Spicy Cream with shrimp and mini udon. My vegan kid loves the fried avocado roll, the veggie delight without cream cheese, and a side of plain udon. Top it off with a Lychee Boba and my tummy is happy!"
9/25/2017,1,"Avoid this Bento (Newberry Rd) location if you can. This is the second time I've had a bad experience. My first bad experience involved the manager. We had almost a 45 min wait for our food and the sushi was cold by the time we got it. Ate maybe 3 pieces of sushi & decided we wanted a refund instead because we had already waited & now have to find another place to eat. The manager stated she could only give a gift card for a return visit. I stated we paid cash, and that is what she must give back. Based on this experience I wouldn't be returning for another visit and I wanted my cash back. After going back & forth with me, she went to the register, stormed back to us and slammed the cash on our table saying ""Just so you know we're not supposed to give cash out of the drawer!""I hadn't been back there in maybe 2 years, until now (which wasn't my choice). My coworkers & I ordered Bento via Bite Delivery last Tuesday. We have always used $2 delivery but apparently it's now merged with Bite. The Archer Bento location was always available on $2delivery, but for some strange reason only Newberry was available on Bite. Since my coworkers were ordering, and it was my only option for food so I went ahead and ordered. I got a Spicy Cream rice bowl & a Mt. Fuji Sushi Bento box. I was pissed after eating my sushi because the sushi rice was not cooked all the way. It tasted horrible and was falling apart when I picked up with chopsticks. Luckily I ordered the rice bowl, because it was cooked fine and I didn't have to starve for the night. I reached out on their contact form & still have not heard back from Bento. I'm extremely unsatisfied with the service & food I received. Spent $20 on food & had to throw half of it away."
5/2/2020,5,I love bento for portion control!  Its ok food and nothing actually delicious but everything is at that Chilis level.
10/8/2017,3,"I ordered the rainbow roll and tasted pretty average. I was surprised because multiple people raved about how great Bento is. The sushi roll was also made very sloppy. Every piece had a different thickness, height, and fish to rice ratio. I also ordered the blended taro milk tea. It was refreshing but incredibly sweet so I was able to share it with someone. Although the restaurant did not meet my expectations I will go back and try something different."
5/18/2019,4,Love Bento  cafe here in newberry road. I usually here for late lunch because not busy. Good food as always. Clean and friendly. I got a bento box takeout this afternoon. Pow pow chicken is always good
9/11/2016,1,"Ok first of all, I have to put a disclaimer in here: I have been coming to Bentos for 9+ years. I've spent undoubtedly hundreds if not thousands of dollars here throughout the years. In college I ate here at least once a week, usually twice. What I saw today made me want to NEVER come back.My sister and I sit down at the table and I turn around and there is a LIVE cockroach on the wall behind me. A big one. I grab a girl bussing tables and tell her, and she was really sweet but terrified of roaches too so wanted to grab a guy busser to take care of it. Ok, fast forward 20 minutes later....no exaggeration. the thing is STILL moving on the wall and as this is the only table left in the restaurant we are still standing there waiting for it to be taken care of. My sister gets fed up and KILLS IT HERSELF. Because that's totally acceptable as a paying customer to be forced into no other option but killing a living cockroach themselves....The servers avoided us like we had the plague. No one EVER came to clean it up. It was still there when we left. For all they knew it was still alive. How comforting..... On the way out was the cherry on top of the whole experience. There was a second cockroach near the exit.  Don't worry, I'm attaching pictures so you can know that I'm not making this disgusting ish up."
1/27/2019,5,"I LOVE IT! this is the best place to eat, no doubt. The food is amazing, service is great, overall an amazing experience. I ordered the Poke Bowl with shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, nori and Sesame seeds. My new favorite place to eat."
4/11/2019,5,"I have always enjoyed Bento whether its dine-in or carry-out.  All locations are great, same level of service, same quality of food and great atmosphere.  I really like the Bento Box options but also love their sushi rolls."
7/7/2020,4,"Super yummy! Love the sushi and the service was pretty fast. I also am a big fan of the restaurant vibe. Very pretty area, I hope to one day come back down this way. Definitely would recommend this for dinner some night."
2/20/2018,1,"My beloved Bentos has really gone down the tubes. Maybe they're expanding too quickly and not bothering to maintain the standards they once had. This use to be the one place I would eat at ALL THE TIME. This last trip was beyond aggravating. I called to place a to go order. The phone rang FOREVER. I checked the number, checked the website, called again. Same thing. I called the Archer location to ask if the Newberry location was still open and double checked the number with her. Called again. Finally someone answered and I can't say she was delightful or pleasant to talk to. She asked to put me on hold. In the time it took for me to call a few times, get put on hold, and for her to come back on the line I had already driven, in traffic, clear across town and was in the freaking parking lot. By the time I got to give my order, I was quoted a 30 minute wait for my food. It's a shame because this place was awesome but based on this last trip, it's another restaurant in town that's gone down significantly and is catering to a college student crowd and service is no longer a priority. I never thought I'd say it, but I'd give this place a big old skip."
3/8/2021,1,"I've lived in Gainesville all my life and loved bentos still do an I'm not one to judge but I'm not stupid either an it seems most of the staff here just barely made it in from a hell of a weekend there sunken in eyes scream ""I can't wait for my next hit of coke"" sad to see one of gville gems in the gutter w the rest of it"
4/3/2020,1,"Submitted an order for 9 hard working employees. Placing the order was a nightmare and they cancelled the order 10 min before we were supposed to pick it up. No call, no follow up. Never again"
11/7/2019,5,all the workers are so cute i actually cried while eating :) kaylan is the sweetest love her she fixed the drinks and gave us yum yum sauce (it's yummy)
2/17/2021,1,Placed order paid extra for 3 different sauces they did not deliver them . The chicken was hard as a rock and was horrible. The crab wontons we ordered were also hard as a rock. Called Bento they said they put all stuff in the bag and the driver must have stolen it. NEVER AGAIN!!!
9/28/2020,5,"I can honestly say the food here was not disappointing! I personally really enjoy orange chicken and the orange chicken was most likely the best I have ever had! the white rice and vegetables it came with could not have been better. I was quite amazed of how they made white rice taste so good but they did it! It did not take long for the food to come out and it was at the perfect temperature, ready to eat! Due to COVID they had every other space closed off which I found so comforting and I saw a worker cleaning the spaces with great detail! They were very kind to take my order and made sure that they were giving me the best experience! Even with the mask on they seemed like they were still giving great, big smiles! The prices were so convenient, and they give you an abundance of food for the price of 10$. I can't wait for my next visit when I want to treat myself, or my friends to a delicious dinner."
8/17/2018,5,"I have been coming here once a week for the past ten years so I may be biased but this is my go to restaurant in Gainesville. I usually get the spicy salmon don (bowl) because it's the best but you also can't go wrong with some of their bento box options. I would recommend their spicy cream chicken, and if you don't like spicy, you can always go teriyaki. Bento is fast, convenient, and above all consistent in providing a good quality meal at a reasonable price."
10/6/2018,4,"I remember the good ol' days when you could get as much delicious white sauce as you needed to finish off your rice bowl. Now they charge above 1 dinky little spoonful.Maybe I'm just old but I miss that version of Bentos. Ate here probably 2-3 times a week in undergrad and invited everyone I knew because the food is THAT good. A little more expensive than when I was here two years ago and the servers kept forgetting to give us napkins and utensils. But, the food... still worth it."
3/23/2018,4,"My daughter has been eating Bentos sushi for years, but once I had their Pad Thai I've been sold. It's delicious and has become almost the only thing I order. I've also had their General Tao, and it's by far the best I've ever had as well. Not giving them 5 stars cause they consistently messed up large party orders, and they can be very slow. Best to go there early before the rush."
6/25/2019,2,"I've always come or picked up food from Bento on Newberry. However this last time really turned me off to this location. I ordered a poke bowl with onions and avocado and the order was made incorrectly. Instead of onions I was given edamame, my worst enemy. When I called the person spoke to told me if I went they'd give a new bowl so I quickly got in my car and went to pick up the bowl that was supposed to be ready. When I got there I was greeted by a not so friendly staff who would only give me chopped red onions. I have red onions at home, I would've chopped them myself and saved myself the trip. I really hope they get some new management or some hospitality training. What was meant to be a relaxing after work dinner turned into an embarrassing mess and a waste of gas."
3/11/2018,1,"I was given undercooked chicken and they messed up my order! I've eaten at Bento for years, but after last night I will never be going back. I ordered two seasame chicken rice bowls through the Bite Squad delivery service from Bentos. When they delivered my order it was missing one bowl because Bento did not pack the order correctly (this was not Bite squads fault) then as I started to eat the one bowl given to me I noticed a piece of chicken was still raw in the center. I called Bento to complain and they were extremely rude about the situation and didn't want to do anything about it since they were closing in 10 minutes. I spoke to the manager and they said there was nothing they could do because I ordered through a service. (I did get a refund from Bite Squad after this) Even though Bento wasn't able to refund me I expected them to at least apologize for serving me undercooked chicken and practice good customer service by trying to correct the situation on their end a little bit. It was their fault after all and all I got from them was attitude. This isn't the first time I've experienced rude customer service at Bentos. The location on Archer Road in Gainesville was rude when I complained about having multiple hairs wind up in my bowl. So if you don't like hair in your food or having salmonella from consuming raw chicken followed by rude management I wouldn't suggest going here.  See attached photos of undercooked chicken"
6/11/2018,3,"Near UF. Affordable priced so many students come and take out poke bowls or sushi. They also have cooked hot dishes for you to choose and grab to go. Sometimes may have a long line maybe due toShort in staffing. Great poke dishes ( tuna , salmon and mixed)"
2/14/2018,5,"First time here and sucks we are moving in a few months because their food was boss! Heard some folks speak about this place while getting my car serviced. Came here for our Valentine dinner because I have 2 cute dates. We arrived just at 1700 and glad we came when we did, the flood of people that arrived after us was wow! Just etched in my mind that this was going to have some good food. There were several Bite Squad guys too. I'm not sure if this is the norm or just due to the ""Hallmark"" holiday. My son had the sweet/sour chicken kid's box which came with about 4-5 pieces of chicken, lo mein or rice, green beans and these little iced chips. His meal was free bc the deal they had was an adult bento box would give a child's box free. My mom had the teriyaki chicken bento box (in photos) & was amazed at how much grilled chicken that came with the meal plus how tender and juicy it was. She loved all that was on the box. My daughter and I had sushi. She did the sushi box which she ordered the Mexican roll x2 & it came with the Cali roll, salad, & some shredded green stuff. Her sushi box is my check-in photo. I had the hot lava and flying dragon minus avocado (yuck). I didn't see prices for drinks, only the special teas so water it is.  Some Sushi rolls come in 4 or 8 pieces ie ones my daughter ordered but mine were 8 pieces each. Also it can be quite loud inside so if they are busy and it's nice weather, sit outside. We'll return before we leave."
4/13/2017,4,"Bento is your typical Asian Fusion type restaurant and I frequent here to get their Pad Thai or most importantly, the Chicken Curry Katsu (with red curry of course)!I usually get the rice bowl with my Chicken Curry Katsu, which comes with some bak choy or green beans - but the best part is the sauce. It is a little spicy but very flavorful when used as a dipping sauce for the chicken and poured onto the rice. I have also tried it in the Bento Box form, which comes with little portions of green beans, a little dessert, noodles and salad. I prefer getting it with rice because I don't think the Bento Box is worth the extra dollars if you're super hungry because you don't get as much chicken!The Pad Thai here is not the best I have tried, but it is pretty good. There are red peppers in this dish and it is a little spicy compared to other sweet types of Pad Thai that I have tried elsewhere. When ordering this, I usually get the noodle bowl because it is the best option.On the weekends, this place is super crowded and the line will be wrapped around so make sure to call in your order (even if you want to dine-in). It will save you time!"
8/23/2019,1,"Looking for sushi this is not the place if sushi rolls are your thing this is still not the place. We found this place from yelp decided to try got there around 9pm you wait in line to place your order the staff was short and rude,the place was dirty. When our food arrived at the table the sushi was at room temperature the miso soup was not good it was very grainy I could go on but I think this is enough to say won't make this my go to place for sushi"
8/25/2019,2,"Poor service, wet mop smell, sticky floors, dirty tables, average rice bowl = not worth it."
4/14/2009,5,"I have been craving their Almond Joy Boba Milk Tea endlessly for months since the last time I came here. I surely got my fix this time -- a LARGE serving of it! My craving will be satisfied for the next few months.... =) Yes, I can get others to imitate it, but there's nothing like the original. A holy trinity of flavors (coconut, chocolate, and almond) mixed evenly into a milk tea treat mixed with tapioca pearls.By the way, they don't have ramen here. I asked. =("
10/28/2019,5,I love Bento! Good amount of food for the price you are paying and every meal I have tried there I enjoyed. I recommend highly.
1/4/2015,3,"Made a quick stop for dinner on the way back from Disney on a Monday night at 6pm. You take a menu at the entrance and order at the counter before sitting down at either an indoor or outdoor table.FOOD:- Mongolian Beef Bento Box: the Mongolian Beef was very salty. It's as if it was sitting out in a buffet line. I would say the same for the Lo Mein. As if it was sitting for a while. - Sushi combo box: For my sushi combo box, I choose the Florida roll, Spicy UF roll, & California roll. I thought they were all just okay.- We also ordered two bubble teas: Mango green tea with mango jelly & Milk tea with boba. These were okay. Not as great as the bubble tea stores that you find in Atlanta. Overall, I do not see myself returning to this location's Bento Cafe. Everything was mediocre. I know there are several sister Bento Cafe's in Florida that I would like to visit."
4/29/2019,5,"I have never had a bad experience here, bento is perfect. The only thing I don't like is how they fry their sushi. I think when it's fried it tastes cheap. The wait time is long but worth it. The edamame is also very tasty and seasoned well and the dumplings are HUGE."
9/26/2019,5,"Spicy creamy chicken with udon noodles or rice is soooooooooo good. Once in a while they'll burn something then cook your food in the burned oil so it tastes burned, but normally it's the best!!!"
2/15/2019,2,"Very disappointed to find several pieces of chicken in my tofu bowl. I'm giving one star because my boyfriend enjoyed his food and because this is out of character for Bento, I normally love it. Very sad."
9/12/2020,2,The service absolutely sucks !!! Two times during this pick up only I waited for 30 minutes after calling in my order only to find out it was on the pick up table the entire time !!! And no a free tea does not make it all better !!!
5/24/2018,1,"I've been sick for a week after having dinner here,Three consecutive days with a headache, body ache,sore throat and fatigue.How much MSG is in their food??!!!"
8/8/2016,4,"Can't wait for Bentos to open up in Tallahassee! Their menu is massive, and everything is cheap and enticing. They have one menu with hot foods including bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, soups, and appetizers. The other menu lists their sushi rolls and sashimi, as well as sashimi bowls and the new poké bowls. My indecisive self was overwhelmed, to say the least. After much contemplation I decided to split a flying dragon roll and poké bowl, although all of the hot options did sound amazing as well. The flying dragon roll had tempura shrimp, krab, avocado, Japanese mayo, topped with eel, masago, and eel sauce. The tastes all came together very well to create a delicious sushi roll. What stole the show though was the poké bowl. This choice was recently added to their menu and after hearing much hype I was very excited to try one! For the poké bowl, you build your own, choosing one, two, or three proteins (50 cent up-charge as add more protein). You then choose three mix ins and two sauces. You can make your bowl as healthy or as unhealthy as you like depending on the protein and toppings you choose. Everything I had was extremely fresh and tasty. I would suggest trying the tuna poké as your protein in the poké bowl, the marinade added a great flavor to the tuna. My friends all ordered bento boxes that looked great, and came with a ton of food! I'll have to try one myself next time and write an update. The quality of food for the low price is phenomenal. This will be my new go-to spot for quick and yummy food once they open in Tallahassee."
2/11/2009,5,"My friend and I came here yesterday when I came up to take a vacation in Gainesville and I have to see I was extremely impressed with this place. The menu is so diverse, it's pretty to find Korean, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian cuisines all perfectly combined on a menu, and I pretty much decided to go in all different directions in my ordered.I ordered a bulgogi steak bento box with a thai tea boba and also ordered a California Roll and Eel Roll.  The order was out in only a matter of minutes. The bento box was delicious and perfectly filling, I think the bulgogi at Sa Ri One in Tampa was a little better, but that doesn't mean this bulgogi tasted bad at all, it was quite delicious. The thai tea was perfectly made, not too much ice and strong flavor with very sweet and tender boba balls that didn't freeze up like I've had happen to me at some other places that I order thai tea at with boba.The sushi tasted very fresh, the crab in the California Roll was great, and the Eel Roll tasted good as well, it didn't have it's normal overpowering taste though so  I won't say it is the best sushi I have had, but it was pretty good and certainly worth it. The establishment is very nicely set up, appearing as a relaxing place with couches and a cool vibe to it, they even had the Initial D anime on two of their televisions, which I found to be pretty cool. I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in Gainesville."
8/22/2017,4,I love bento cafe. The service is usually great and very friendly atmosphere! The food is absolutely delicious although I've gotten my order mixed up a few times they have always been more than willing to fix it without hesitation. I recommend!!!
4/24/2018,4,"Last night I had my first trip to Bento Cafe.  I know I have been here for over a year and this was just my first time... What?   But I went in and thought I would give a new place a try.  I am sad that this was just my first time as everything was great.  I went in on a Monday night and visited the Newberry Rd location.  For being a Monday night I was surprised on how busy this place was.  I decided to order a Bento Box and then also got a Sushi box as well.  I have to say for a Bento Box it is not a ton of food for the money, but I was okay with it because it tasted amazing.  The Bento box comes with a protein your choice of chicken, steak and a few others, rice, ginger salad, lo mein, and green beans.  When you choose your protein you choose how you want it prepared.  I got it as Orange chicken and it tasted wonderful.  The chicken was by far my favorite thing.  They use big chunks of white meat chicken and the sauce was awesome.  I also tried the sushi and this was really good sushi.  The sushi chefs were working really fast since they had a ton of orders.  The sushi was fresh and had great tastes.  I tried the California Roll, Rainbow Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll.  All three had a lot of fresh flavor and tasted great.  Only concern I would have was the customer service of the girl who was working last night.  She had a key around her arm so I would assume she was the manager.  She called out the name to get the food.  All she did was put the food down and did not say thank you, or have a great day. I asked for some extra soy sauce, she reached in grabbed a handful and tossed it in the bag kinda rudely.  But overall I enjoyed my first time and will for sure be going back to try more menu items!!"
12/6/2016,4,"Bento Cafe is so good!  There are two locations in Gainesville (on two of the most populated roads) and this is my preferred location.  The lighting and atmosphere is awesome, it looks Oriental and trendy inside with some outside seating available as well.  You order in line instead of having a waitress.  In my experience, I usually end up waiting quite a while in line, but I don't mind because the food is so good!  I highly recommend the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl, it's the best!  The noodles are not fried and have an amazing flavor.  The bento boxes are good as well.  And they have takeout!!  Can't go wrong at Bento."
4/3/2017,5,I love this Bento! Always has great service and is relatively quick. The people are friendly too! My favorite is the Red Curry Tofu bowl with brown rice.
11/10/2016,5,"Delicious!! The place was crowded- and I can see why! The food was so fresh and delicious. I had the Korean tofu, it was SO flavorful. My two teenage kids had the orange chicken and the bulgogi-  and raved about it. The service was friendly and quick. Looking forward to going here again"
3/1/2019,2,The McDonald's of sushi but with worse service. They consistently leave ingredients out of the rolls that are described in the menu and the staff is usually annoyed with your existence.
12/26/2015,4,"Also known as ""Bento Blue"" I find this one to be somewhat better then the archer road location in town,  when busy, like both locations the line can take quite a while just to place your order. I do like that when they offer 1 free sauce per sushi roll ordered (i.e. Eel sauce, spicy mayo, etc) before they were additional .50 each. At first Bento can be a little overwhelming to the new first timer. Having to look through and hold 2 separate menus front and back till you decide what you want quickly and remember so you can tell the counter person. Once you have it down pat your in good hands. The staff is very efficient on getting your orders correct and out to the guests, for the most part the customer service is on point!The sushi has always been great! Very fresh! And the food prepared in the back of house also very good!  **TIP** if your a fan of tofu they have great bento boxes with tofu, personally I would suggest the SILKEN TOFU which you have to specifically ask for otherwise they will give you a harder more spongy version. My favorite is the Thai coconut curry bento box with silken tofu.  You won't be disappointed. Bento serves Coke products with the touchscreen soda machine with free refills. Gainesville definitely has a big following for Bento and they have been doing it right. I definitely recommend this restaurant for you to try for a not so quick service Panera style restaurant. Enjoy!"
6/16/2017,5,Delicious popular Asian foods in a nice friendly setting. Service is fast. Prices are right. The food is better prepared than the other Bento on Archer Road.
7/29/2016,4,"Bento is a Gainesville staple. If you don't know Bento, then you probably haven't lived in Gainesville very long.  I personally prefer the Bento red location on Archer road but I have ate at this one (blue) on Newberry too many times to count so I thought it was only fair to review blue first!This place was where I tried my very first Boba Tea (maybe 14 years ago.. welp. Getting old). Because of this, Bento will always hold a special place in my heart.  The sweet jasmine green tea with chewy boba is impossible to resist. As far as food items, I have tried a good portion of the menu but I have my main staples: Spicy Salmon Salad (spicy mayo on side and extra wakame), Spicy Salmon Don (when I'm extra hungry, extra wakame and maybe eel added), ginger shrimp bento box (very ginger-y), red curry rice bowl (silken tofu not fried and/or shrimp). I always get a green tea with tapioca boba but occasionally I also get a kiwi slush with boba (they freeze unlike mochi but I like them frozen) As far as the quality of the food, it could be fresher and sometimes the fish is cut a little odd in the sushi bowls, but it's not fine dining and Bento is really easy to call in and pick up when I'm heading home from errands via Newberry Road so it's not a huge deal to comprise a bit of quality for convenience sometimes.. I'm not a big fan of the Chirashi bowl mostly because I always feel a little disappointment with the assortment of fish. It's ok but not a stand out item. I do love that they don't force you into getting the tofu fried like some other Pan-Asian in town do.Service is always super friendly, everyone working seems very knowledgeable of the menu and I never get any confused looks for requests to substitute, add or omit items from my order. The inside area is pretty small but the environment is there. Dim lighting (I hate when places ruin an experience with harsh, abrasive lighting), Postal Service or some similar music playing, and anime on the TV a lot of the time :) Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for some quick, Pan-Asian fare that doesn't leave your pockets more empty than your belly!"
10/10/2018,3,It's just okay. It's quick Americanized Asian food. I'd say it's like a nicer Panda Express and it's made to order. The service is good though
8/12/2014,4,"Mt. Fuji roll!!!!! They also have some new wings that are pretty good...Service is friendly, as always."
8/23/2018,1,"They got rid of my favorite tangy chicken katsu sauce and replaced it with ""BBQ katsu sauce"" which is really just normal tonkatsu sauce you can get from any Asian market. I'm in absolute despair."
3/24/2019,5,"Love the here, it's a great place to eat with some friends after class.  Plus the have the tea with boba and the Coca-Cola freestyle machine. There is a lot of options to eat and drink from here."
12/19/2015,4,"I ate at Bento on Newberry tonight with my husband. It was a Saturday night, and there was a line to the door for ordering, and it moved quite slowly. The tiny restaurant was packed, and after we had placed our orders, there was no place to sit. I hovered over a table with people who looked like they were about to leave until they actually did. Our food was brought out to us promptly, so I was pleasantly surprised by that. I had the sushi combo box, which was one california roll and 4 pieces each of Alaskan and Philly roll. My sushi was very tasty and fresh. My husband had the chicken pad thai, and I kept sampling from his bowl. He finished the entire thing- it was really good! Overall, I think I will stick to the Bento on Archer, just because there is more seating, but this location holds its own as well."
7/15/2013,3,"Bentos strives to be a trendy place to eat, and at one point might have been, but over the years the restaurant has begun to show its age. The dining room just doesn't seem clean like it used to be. The tables and eating utensils (not the chop sticks) usually seem dirty. The nice lighting inside the restaurant isn't going to hide a poorly cleaned dinning room. At this point I try to avoid dining in here. I do still get food to-go though. Their menu is pan Asian with plenty to choose from. The food on average is average. It's something to eat to get full, not something to eat to thoroughly enjoy. I recommend their beef bulgogi and chicken katsu. I prefer to get their noodle bowls upgraded to udon noodles over their bento boxes. I avoid their miso soup and salads (tough and drowned in ginger dressing). If you need a quick bite to eat before going to see a movie next door, this is an ideal location to visit. As long as Gainesville has freshmen, they'll have an audience. But as someone whose eaten here quite a bit over a long period of time, they aren't fooling me into thinking this is a cool place to eat with top notch food."
1/27/2019,2,"Not very good. Poke bowl was not great. Fish didnt taste fresh, rice was plain and not cooked well, the toppings were all bland. Fried tofu was good though. For the price I just expected better. Publix sushi tastes better then what they offer here. Wouldnt recommend this place."
7/25/2017,2,I love the food! But this location smells like poopy diaper every time I've been here and it's way to hot to sit outside.
5/26/2017,1,I was always a fan of Bento but this one sucked at customer service. We ordered two sushi boxes and boba teas for takeout. We got our teas quickly however i was waiting 26 minutes for my food. My husband mentioned to them about the wait time and literally the food was sitting on the counter for who knows how long. And i didn't even get an apology from them. Sorry Bento you've lost a faithful customer.
10/9/2018,1,"Never fails they always forget to send soy sauce, chopsticks, wasabi or ginger... even when you remind them. Like seriously should not be that hard"
10/10/2017,2,"Not a sushi connoisseur. I do eat sushi pretty often, though. Somehow I lived In gainesville for 1.5 years without trying Bento. I wish I hadn't. Poor food and wait time at non peak hours. I'm not someone who complains about stuff like this normally. Salmon in sushi was warm. You get the picture. Only reason for above 1 star was free refills and cold stone across the street that made the evening better. Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else. (Literally any other place in Gainesville.)"
5/10/2016,5,Tried the poké don bowl and my wife had the spicy tuna don bowl. Everything was so damn good! It tasted fresh and healthy and was a lot of food! The Coke freestyle machine was buggin out for everyone while we were there haha
7/10/2018,4,Awesome food!! The poke bowls are amazing as are the apps. Great for take out or delivery! Great go to for dinner when you're too busy or lazy too cook.
5/14/2016,5,"Just moved from Connecticut and was looking for a new place to get my sushi fix. I was a bit spoiled where I lived so I was looking through yelp to get recommendations when I came across this cute little place called Bento. I ordered several things to try off the menu, and was very pleased with the fresh fish served. It is absolutely a fantastic replacement for my sushi fix. I am now addicted to their milk teas which come in any flavor you can think of. They have a very large menu, one for sushi and one for hot entrees from the kitchen. I can see myself coming here often."
5/8/2018,5,"I have always loved Asian food, Bento is my favorite places to go for it. They have an awesome menu and the prices are reasonable. I almost always get there sushi combo box which is great."
8/20/2018,5,Great prices & really good food! The staff is super nice and the restaurant is clean with a great vibe!
5/13/2017,1,"Bento has gone downhill over the last couple of months. Today, I walked in to what smelled like a vomit-chamber. It was not an isolated smell. Not only did they mess up my order and give it to someone else, we were rudely handed our food items outside, and told to ""grab our utensils near the water machine."" There was seaweed in the boba tea, and tears in my salad. Usually, I go to Bento Red, but I figured I would give Bento Blue a chance, as it was open later. I'm heavily disappointed and I hope things change. Sincerely, a Bento Believer."
4/27/2018,4,"Great place for a quick bite. The sushi was tasty, the service was great. We had a poki bowl, a shrimp roll, and drive kind of dragon roll. The sushi was tasty and the poki bowl was huge! We try to stop here wherever we're in Gainesville."
4/6/2017,3,"Great food, but we had to eat outside because for some reason the restaurant itself smells terrible. I'm not sure what's going on in there, but it is not a good thing. Otherwise, service, food, presentation were all excellent."
2/23/2015,5,The bento boxes here are amazing and its the only place in town that makes a good milk tea.I'm a huge fan of the boxes as the ginger salads are perfect and the deserts are a great way to end the meal.
12/22/2016,5,"I was in love with this place and returned as often as I could unfortunately it was crowded most of the time so a good advice would be to call ahead. Located in a shopping plaza it could be easy to miss, plenty of parking and outside seating available. I ordered the Tuna rice bowl (w/o spicy mayo sauce) I'm a fan of clean eating and being able pick my ingredients is a plus, even though my bowl looked very simple (and plain) the Tuna was so great it didn't need any sauce. The menu is extensive and there are options for everyone. I wish I had one back home."
4/2/2018,5,"The Chicken pad Thai is to DIE for. Whether I dine in, or get it delivered, it is always on point. The staff is always efficient and professional. I'm so glad this location is so close to my office."
8/11/2017,5,"Loved the orange chicken, great portions and quick service. If you're in the mood for Chinese I'd suggest this place"
7/21/2019,1,"Over priced food and mediocre service. Staff was friendly enough, just seemed tired and over worked. Not a surprise from what I've heard of the Tong family (owners) and their litany of legal settlements over the years"
1/17/2018,5,"Priced a little high, but food is amazing! I have been coming here since early 2011 - The spicy salmon don is my favorite! They have lots to choose from if sushi isn't your thing though... lately I have been ordering the noodle bowls (love the udon, they are HUGE noodles). The spicy creamy shrimp and spicy creamy chicken over udon is so delicious.  They have rice bowls, as well as the noodle bowls, and there are several choices for the protein. The wait staff are always friendly, and I will continue to come here!"
6/28/2019,3,The food is good but the service is bad. Shout out to the Manager for treating me in a sort of bad way with his sarcastic tone. Definitely going to keep going to bentos but the one on Archer because I can't deal.
2/15/2017,4,Bento was one of my absolute favorite places when I lived in Gainesville. They have a pretty extensive menu and have college nights where they'll run specials with your college ID. My favorite order was either a bento box (all are delicious) or the pad Thai. I have been trying for seven months now in Texas to find a pad Thai that even remotely compares to the one at Bento. So delicious! This place gets crowded so I would usually order over the phone and my food would always be ready by the time I drove over
7/6/2016,2,"I was born and raised in Gainesville, where Bento was the staple of my pre-teen and teen years. Everytime I came back to visit, I'd find myself at Bento because of their reliably delicious and fairly priced food & bubble tea. This past visit, however, I was met with disappointment. There were flies covering one of the booths. Then, after waiting for quite some time, I overheard the staff say that they had forgotten to make my order. Once it was brought out, I noticed that they messed up my order by not including the fish I had chosen for my poke salad bowl (tuna rather than salmon), but at that point I just wanted to eat. Finally, the quality of their bubble tea has gone down dramatically in the past year. They must be ordering their supplies from a different distributor now, but the bubble tea tastes watered down and the bubbles aren't great. Even after the staff added more powder, there wasn't too much of a flavor difference, but the texture became very chalky. This review is only so negative because I know how great Bento once was, and this simply was not up to its previous standards."
12/3/2014,4,Love eating at this place. They have a large selection on the menu and food is always good. My Gf loves the teas.
10/1/2016,5,Awesome service and great food. Reasonable prices and good atmosphere. I got a Poké bowl and a taroberry Shake :)
1/18/2017,5,SO good! I had the yellow curry with crispy chicken and mini udon. I also had the matcha green tea boba. Delicious and not crazy expensive. I'd definitely come back.
6/10/2016,4,"I absolutely love sushi and thankfully Gainesville has two Bento locations. I am always pleased with my meal but the only bad thing I have to say is sometimes I have to wait a while for my food to come out. For that reason, I'll adjust my order somewhat if its a busy time of day and only get an uncooked roll so that it speeds up the process. Otherwise, I think its a fun place and a great way to help my sushi addiction!"
4/7/2016,2,"Not going to soften this up. My bento box was soggy, the salad was warm, my rice was in a soup of sauce, lacked flavor, my noodles were kind of cold,and meat was kinda cold.  Next time let your servers be at least fake nice."
7/21/2016,3,"I think the food is good, but a little pricey for essentially fast food. The reason for three stars is the lousy service. The folks behind the counters don't make eye contact and don't smile. They are working to get you out of their line. Kind of a bummer because I love the braised beef noodle soup."
1/16/2019,5,Too bad you can only give 5 stars. Devin the manager on duty at the Davie store when I was there provided the greatest service possible. The food was great but he provided greater customer service.
10/26/2013,3,"I had the Coconut Chicken Curry Bento Box. It had noodles, a mini salad, the chicken coconut curry, rice, green beans, and for some reason a Rice Krispie treat. The salad noodles and rice were perfect. The curry coconut chicken was so-so. It wasn't very good, too average. I was confused why there was a rice krispie treat because it had nothing to do with it. We also had the Zombie Roll which was unique and I liked it. I have never seen sushi with tiny red caviar and some fried green vegetable. It tasted good and I liked the variation of sushi. However, there was a cockroach in the men's bathroom. I told a woman and she said she'll do something to get it out."
2/2/2017,4,"Dons are by far the way to go. You get a ton of sushi for the $$. Make sure that you do the build-a-don to try all of the different meats. Sometimes the freshness can be a little hit or miss, but overall everything is usually great. The spicy cream chicken noodle bowl is amazing if you aren't a fan of sushi!"
7/23/2016,4,"Love this place.  Funny thing is that I like what's IN the bento boxes better than the entrees. The green beans, noodles and sweet wonton chips in every box are great. I like the beef teriyaki.  I also really like their bowls, it's a hard choice between a box and a chirashi bowl.  The poke had been the only thing I've had that has been disappointing.  And my son likes the popping bubbles in the tea. I steal more than my fair share."
11/14/2014,5,"This place is amazing. I don't understand the negative reviews. Sure, it's going to be busy depending on certain times. If you're going out for takeout or to dine in anywhere on a Friday or Saturday night in a college town what do you expect? Sometimes the lines move slow because of all the choices on the menu, or because the cashier is explaining a dish to a customer. But I've never waited too long to complain. At my most recent visit, something made me really upset though. I purchased a fountain drink and then walked to the back where they have one of those high tech fountain machines with all the choices. They only had seagrams ale and water available. I thought it was terrible that they let me buy a fountain drink when that's all they had. I'm confident they weren't aware though. I also didn't say anything, so I'm sure they would have helped. Just keep that in mind and check the fountains before buying soda."
1/31/2016,5,I've been going to the Bento for years since they first open. Now they have a new location closer to my house but I still go to both. I love the diversity of Asian delight at this establishment. I love their national champ roll. But it's hard to choose a favorite everything is good.
11/17/2016,4,Good Asian fusion and decent sushi for a fast-food type place. The spicy cream chicken is a must.
5/24/2013,4,"Bento is a great place for casual Asian food.The food is good...I have had some questionable dishes but when you order right, you will be satisfied. I love the spicy cream chicken or shrimp!Sushi is quite good. It is the only place in town that I will eat sushi. Try the spicy UF roll.The best part are the amazing prices. You get a lot of very tasty food for extremely fair prices."
11/18/2013,4,"The Environment:Great for groups, very young feeling, and pretty hip!  Definitely a good place to be.The Food:I had the spicy creamy shrimp in a rice bowl.  It was... DELICIOUS.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  The flavor was very unique, not like anything I had tried before.There's also alcohol and a huge menu.  But I think it'd be worth trying again!"
3/16/2013,4,"I recently went gluten-free... so I have ventured into the world of sushi which I never really had before.  Bento has become one of my quick options for food... it's really easy to make any dish gluten free by asking for steamed chicken or shrimp instead of fried.  I have a favorite creation that I stick to... it's a spicy tuna roll with a few additions (cream cheese, avocado and cucumber).  Check out this place, it's pretty good!"
7/11/2012,5,"So I am from fort lauderdale... Back home there isn't great bubble tea. The best place we had was lollicup. Lollicup close though. So for me to go to Gainesville and find this place was a miracle. Of course, it's thru recommendation! I tried the sushi and I had the bubble tea. I had a mocha magic! It was great:) I love it. The sushi was great.I saw someone order a crunchy salmon roll, it look great and taste even better!let me tell you the price was a bonus! We ate 2 rolls, and soda, and a bowl of rice of bulgogi for $25.00 ? Maybe 30 but that's nothing compare to what we usually pay! I love it! It's fun! The environment is great :) all the girls are pretty and kind too!! Love it!"
4/3/2016,5,Best sushi I ever had. Nice seating outside and inside. Can get any sushi roll tempura fried. So good.
6/30/2011,4,"Yay! My friend used to try and convince me to go here with her, but I always thought it was a bit overpriced, so I usually just ate a burrito from next door while she inhaled the Bento box (minus the plastic). Tonight D and I went with our hard earned garage sale cash, $24. Yum! Glad we made that decision. We ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken, the Florida roll, and the Gainesville roll, all to share. I ended up eating more of the sushi, however. The fish was plenty, the rice, sticky but not mushy, seaweed not overpowering the taste nor texture of it's contents. We called in take out for the fear of not making it in time for outdoor seating, and it was made just in time for our arrival. Good hours, nice staff, tasty Thai tea with boba FTW!"
9/18/2015,5,Nice clean place. Modern decor. Self served mixed cola machine. A little pricy but the food was fresh and delicious.
6/22/2010,3,"So I've been back quite a few times and have had their Bulgogi and Teriyaki.  I am happy to report that I have not gotten sick once.  That being said,  Bento has become my go to place for Meat-N-Rice/Noodle dishes though I am not blown away by their Bento boxes.  There is always at least one component of the bento box that is sub-par (the first time it was the noodles and dessert,  last time it was dessert only).  I generally stick to the rice/noodle bowls and teas.It 'aint Momofuku Noodle Bar (nowhere close) but it does fill a niche."
1/5/2009,4,"Can they keep up with all of the customers? Sure they can!  There is often a line, but don't be discouraged, because the line moves fast and you are guaranteed an excellent  meal.  The only thing about this location is that they do not serve duck, but everything else on the menu is the same if not better. Their food is authentic, nutritious, trendy, exiting, and fulfilling at once. The atmosphere is amazing with groovy ambient techno and glowing tables. There are families, college students, and elderly couples are dining there and enjoying all that they have to offer. Gainesville is so lucky to have such an amazing local business in their town that caters to everyone, offering a taste of Taiwanese teahouse culture, rivaling some of the greats, such as Saints Alp Teahouse. Most meals are about $6.50 and come in a Bento box as a six course meal. The food is a terrific mix of Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese. Noodle bowls, soup bowls, rice bowls, sushi, tempura, bento boxes, and teriyaki. The highlight of the dining experience is the bubble tea. If you have not tried it, then you are missing out. In the hot Florida months, my favorite is Jasmine Green tea with green apple syrup and lychee jelly."
3/18/2015,5,"Amazing place to hangout at and have a small meal! Their bento boxes are really good and come with so many things. My boyfriend likes their rice bowls and has visited 3 times already! Really cool soda machines, too. They have AC problems sometimes but it's not too bad."
11/19/2009,4,"I've never had the sushi here, but the food entrees are delicious.  I always get the rice bowl (you can also get a bento box), which includes your choice of entree atop a bed of white rice in a large bowl.  The quality of the meat is good and the vegetables have always been fresh and cooked properly.  I recommend the spicy Korean chicken (it's not that spicy), red curry beef (very spicy), or the sweet and sour chicken.The atmosphere is very relaxed.  Dim lighting, with some tables having fluorescent light bulbs within the tables.  Some staff members can be friendly, and some can be stoic.  After your meal, you leave your trash and empty plates at the table and an employee will take care of it.  This is good if you just want to eat, then get up and go."
11/10/2007,2,"Bento's is a place to go if you want a quick bite of decent food to eat.  They offer food in rice bowls or in a bento box with some sides.  I recommend not ordering from that side of the menu due to the lack of consistency, cold (meaning not kept hot when it should be) sides, and smaller portions.  The only thing I ever enjoyed were the noodle soup bowls.  I ordered the chicken katsu udon bowl and I added vegetables for an extra charge.  The katsu was somewhat crispy, but nowhere near as good as can be. I'm not quite sure if they use a panko crust, and if they did it's not very good.  The soup overall was fine, the udons were average, and the watery soup lacking depth but still somewhat tasty.  The better bowl out there is the sliced Szechuan beef.In the sushi area, they mostly serve rolls and they have just average quality fish.  You can easily tell because they heavily dress their rolls with a bunch of stuff, but hey, at least it's edible. I don't dare try their nigiri.Service is fine.  2.5 stars overall!"
7/16/2012,2,"Ordered the red curry over rice, and it literally tasted like nothing. It was like eating styrofoam packing peanuts and then every once in a while my mouth would feel hot. Tofu was undercooked and the pad thai had a fishy taste. Bland, boring, and not worth the hype.... it's like the Kim Kardashian of Asian food."
11/1/2012,3,"Bento Cafe, or Bento Blue as the Bento folks like to call it, was the first Bento restaurant of their now six or more establishments in Gainesville, Orlando, and Jacksonville. It opened in either 2003 or 2004 and just short of a decade of business, it is starting to show some wear to its somewhat-sleek interior. Certainly, after Bento Red (Archer Road) expanded, the atmosphere at Bento Blue seems rather plain and even in need of work in places. I've had no less than three first dates here though and have fond nostalgia for the place so I'd probably hate to see too much of a change, in all candor.As for the food, their menu of bento-box and rice bowl pan-Asian dishes has remained much the same for years though now and then new menu items have been added. Their sushi is good, but not great, as one would expect for the quasi-fast-food approach at hand. The bento boxes come with white rice, noodles, green beans, a salad with ginger dressing, and a small dessert like a cookie and that's not changed since opening day as far as I know. Sometimes these sides are quite good, other times the noodles are tough or rice overcooked. The main dishes themselves vary a lot, but I've recently noticed they're often overly salty--especially those like the basil stir-fry that have a lot of a sauce with them. The katsu fares very well though and the General Tso's chicken is ok. The sushi . . . often pretty good, sometimes not good at all. The krab delite nigiri and the Mexican rolls are my favorites though and always impressive, albeit simple. The more complex rolls . . . well, more to go wrong I suppose and sometimes that's exactly what happens. Bento's fun, but the Bento Red location is better than this one: I'd probably give that location four stars instead of three. I would not choose either just for sushi on nights I want to go out for sushi though. Mahzu is light-years better in that regard. The bento boxes and decently-priced, informal, meals with friends are what Bento's all about and it's great for that, but be well prepared that things can be a bit off at times . . . and quite salty very often."
2/6/2007,4,"Oh man,i love Bento! I eat here all the time.Qay better than the overrated-gas-inducing Moe's.Bento blows that joint out of the water.Cheap,tasty Bento boxes,fast service from hot honeys ;-`) sealed the deal for me."
12/18/2015,2,"Decent food, disappointed in that my chicken was all dark meat chunks that were fatty and quite honestly nasty compared to my buddy who got all nice white meat strips even though we ordered the same thing.  Teriyaki sauce was lacking, lo mein was a bright spot though.  Too expensive for the little food you get and the taste is not gonna make you feel like your money was well spent.  I'd rather go to pei wei, but still way better than China Star, that place blows big time"
9/6/2013,5,"This is my favorite place in Gainesville. It's a great environment with both indoor and outdoor seating and always great music. They have a wide selection of bento boxes, noodle and rice bowls, sushi, and boba drinks. I have never been disappointed. I prefer this location to the Archer Rd location. It's smaller but service is faster and they don't charge extra for sauces."
7/25/2012,4,Bento is always consistent with quality and affordable Asian fusion.The best deal is the sushi bowl IMO. More fish than a roll at the same price.
4/25/2011,5,"I love this Bento SO much more than the one on Archer. They don't nickel and dime you. Period. If you ask for an extra sauce, it's free. In fact they have eel sauce, spicy mayo, and the like right in front to pump into plastic ramekins. I love their rolls, especially my current obsessions: National Champ roll  and their Lust roll. I'm also a huge fan of their Spicy Cream Shrimp. Their fish is nice and fresh. I've never had a nigiri or sashimi that I didn't love. Tip: If you plan to go when it's busy call ahead and ask for takeout, that way you can avoid the ridiculous lines that form during nights and weekends."
12/31/2017,5,Food quick and amazing. Love their poke bowls and prices are reasonable. This location has outdoor seating so great for bringing my pups along.
2/15/2010,4,"Bentos cafe focuses on the experience and the atmosphere.  But their food is pretty well presented and adequate.  This is my 4th time going this semester. I always get the bento box teriyaki beef but this time I got the General tso Chicken bento box.Before I criticize the general Tso Chicken, I want to clarify that I can make my own General tso chicken and I can make it good hehe.  Anyhow,  the general Tso chicken's presentation was good.  The chicken was nicely done with the crispiness.  The sauce was done well also, however when you eat the chicken with the rice.  It feels like the sauce is not there.  The sauce doesn't have the power to overcome the blandness of the rice.  The sauce supposed to have that power, not the saltiness of the sauce but the flavor of the sauce.  It felt like the General Tso sauce was DILUTED....   Anyhow , every time I make my chicken, I make sure it is strong enough to over come the rice's flavor.  Anyway, the side of veggie (brocolli) was weak!   They gave me 3 pieces of Brocolli.  So cheap :-(     Anyhow, overall the food was good.  The ginger salad was good and the lomein along with the little cake dessert."
12/26/2009,4,"The Boba Teas are delicious and a favorite of mine. I especially like the almond joy flavor.The sushi is good, nothing special, but still good.Various side dishes such as Miso soup or edamame are also average, but still hit the spot.I love the different bowls, however. The Tofu Thai Curry bowl over rice is always delicious. As is a variety of other tofu bowls. I love how they have many tofu options, which is great for vegetarians. The boxes are okay, but I prefer getting the bowls due to the large portion size.Well priced and has a nice atmosphere. I also like the convenience of the location. This is a restaurant I frequent and would recommend if you're looking for something cheap, good, and better than just some quick drive thru. Great before or after a movie over at Royal Park!"
8/28/2011,5,"I love this restaurant and highly recommend it.The food has always been good here--the sushi is decent, depending on the chef.  Done right, the sushi is delicious--I've always liked the volcano roll or the red dragon.  The tuna don is also pretty good--the wakame and the tuna makes for great texture as you bite in to it.  The szechuan beef noodle soup is also great--it's similar to the niu rou mian that's found in Taiwan--pretty authentic and it tastes good.  The boba tea is pretty good too. The boba's consistency and texture is second only to Lollicup.  I've always been a fan of the katsu chicken--compared to other restaurants, it's always crunchy and tender--but the katsu pork has a little too much fat in it.Overall, I love this restaurant and I go here almost once a day.Some of the reviews on here are incredible--sushi is rolled loosely so when you bite in to it, the sushi *bursts.*  And food not coming out all at once?  Really? You're going to complain about that?  Or that the food isn't ""vegan"" because there's cream cheese in it? (Hello! Read the ingredient list on the sushi menu!)."
8/2/2009,3,"OK, let me preface my review by stating that this was my absolute favorite spot during my sophomore and junior years at UF. Now, three years later, it's not the same. The sushi doesn't taste as fresh as it used to and the service has also fallen below the mark. The last time I ate at Bento, my miso soup came out after my sushi rolls and it was lukewarm (and lacking tofu!!). What happened to the Blue Bento I used to know?????"
1/27/2017,1,"Came to get our takeout order. We both ordered udon. They gave us the wrong noodle. Took forever to correct - somehow when they gave us the food again and we got home they gave us one udon and remade the other with mini udon AGAIN? We also ordered our sushi with sauce on the side and they told us it was on the side but when we got home it wa s on the sushi...with two cups of sauce on the side. My katsu bowl didn't even come with the tonkotsu sauce it was supposed to, so now I have dry noodles with no sauce. What a disappointing experience considering how much money we spent."
5/2/2009,3,"I've visited Bento twice on my lunch break.  The first time I had a smoked salmon, avocado, and scallion roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  Both were fine but nothing special.  Mall sushi, I call it.  I don't think I'd try their raw fish.  On my second visit I had the spicy cream chicken bento box.  The chicken was nicely crispy with a very flavorful sauce, but the sides weren't worth bothering with.  Probably better to order the meat entree with a rice bowl and skip the mushy green beens, cold noodles, wilted salad, and dry cake that comes in the bento box.I don't like the food well enough to want to go have a sit-down meal there, but it's an acceptable choice for quick, inexpensive takeout."
2/12/2016,3,Meh....Their signature noodle soup is salty. Their chicken wings are not bad though. The fried dumplings were too dry. Service was only average.
10/13/2014,3,"Most of their sushi rolls are pretty good. I gave a three star rating mainly because they can be a hit-and-miss. I like the mango roll, but there have been times where it has been pretty mediocre. Their milk teas are really good."
2/9/2009,4,"When in Gainsville...visit Bento Cafe. After hearing about it for years - this little place is known to visitors even though it may be difficult to find (this location especially)The atmosphere is pretty dope and this location's theme is blue, as in ICE. The restaurant itself has both indoor and outdoor seating and is a very trendy place to frequent. Don't be surprised if you find professors, students - Asians and non-Asians alike there.The food is good (with the exception of the little desert in the Bento Box), the sushi is acceptable. I was a little weirded out by the fact that they didn't put eel sauce on my eel rolls. In fact, I had to get up and get it myself - or rather, have my bf get it for me. I'm not going to lie, the service was surprisingly fast and the fact that they have all college kids working there makes me feel like it's a fun place to be.Oh, the Bubble tea is also very good - probably the best in Gainesville. If not the only."
10/11/2011,4,"Bento (blue) is great if you have a craving for boba tea and sushi. I've only had their sushi, but I'm looking forward to trying something from the other menu.The dragon roll is SO good. So is lust, especially if you like spicy mayo. Inexpensive, good and quick (even if there's a line)."
11/22/2009,4,"I used to eat sushi at Bento RELIGIOUSLY during my junior year at UF. I can't say I've had any of the entrees at Bento but they always look tasty when I see other people order them. To be honest, they just don't look like they would fill me up. But I'm sure they are tasty. Bento is really good about call-in orders. I used to do this all the time because the place gets PACKED! When I say packed, I mean that the line to order is out the door like Chipotle when they give away free burritos. Every time I go, I order either the Flying Dragon or the Red Dragon, ALWAYS. I love tempura shrimp, crab and avocado and both of these rolls has each. The only difference between the two is that the Red Dragon is topped with tuna and the Flying Dragon is topped with eel. Along with one of these two rolls, I usually order a bunch of other random rolls that I haven't tried before. Depending on my mood, I order a Mango Bubble Tea. Completely DELICIOUS!!!"
6/10/2017,5,"When I want Asian food that I know I can rely on to be delicious I go to Bento's and order a Sesame Tofu bento box. The food is so delicious and well-cooked, and the portions are so satisfying. Their sushi is good too. I prefer this location as opposed to the one on Archer because it is way less crowded and even if there are a lot of people, the line and service is always fast."
7/7/2007,4,"It's fast food pan-asian cuisine, but it's really pretty tasty and for the price... wow.  Go here if you're in the mood for some quick asian food, but don't fancy fried, MSG-laced stuff.  The sushi is unremarkable.  You won't regret ordering it, but it's certainly not going to wow you."
11/8/2010,5,"The food was good and cheap depending on what you get. There's all sorts of asian food from korean, chinese to japanese. It gets really crowded from time to time because lots of college kids come here to get ""bento"" lunchbox style food. They also serve bubble tea which was pretty cheap. Also a sushi bar to eat at.The location is great because it's in a  new/clean  plaza with lots of other restaurant that are great to visit too. Bento is expanding their restaurant which is  a plus!A great place to visit if you're in the area!"
10/20/2015,5,"Best sushi in town. Love it here, the Red Dragon roll is my favorite & also the general tos chicken :) Super yummy!"
9/2/2008,5,"Bento is amazing. I have never eaten at the same place so many times (at the height, more than 4 times a week) and still craved it; so much so that when I make it back to Gainesville this is the one place that am guaranteed to make a stop at. The menu is huge, the sushi is great, the bento boxes (repetitive, I know) are filling, and all for a pretty good price. The wait can sometimes be a little much, but in my opinion it is well worth it, plus the semi-wait service (you order at the counter and the food is brought to your table) dulls the pain. However, if you can't handle the wait at all feel free to call ahead, stop by ten minutes later, and take it home, or have the audacity to eat it there!There are no words to describe how much I love and miss Bento...Oh, I don't recommend getting the shrimp tempura, in a roll it's great, but just the tempura...not so awesome."
11/4/2015,4,Bento is my go-to sushi or ahi tun bowl place. The sushi and ahi tuna always taste fresh to me. I like that I order my food quickly and it is brought to me. I go to Bento probably once a week because I am a total sushi addict.
4/7/2009,3,"Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either. The place has a nice atmosphere(blue lights & stainless steel) and the service is generally great, but the menu is boring and the food is just so-so. There is nothing unique or exciting here and the vegetarian options are less than impressive. You can get a nice big tasty bowl of spicy tuna sashimi here for ~$7, but it's not the best sushi joint in town--even for the moderate price range.This is a good option if you have a large group of people with a major disagreement about where to get dinner, as there is an adjourning southwestern restaurant and a smoothie bar which share the same outdoor seating(so your group can eat at different restaurants and still sit at the same table)."
10/10/2007,3,"Excellent udon bowls.  Other reviewers are correct about their sushi; it's a good grade but not excellent, and doesn't at all compare to the better sushi restaurants in town.  Bento boxes are a mixed bag; the meat dish/main course is usually piping hot, while the surrounding side dishes are inevitably cold (as in, ""not kept warm"" rather than ""meant to be cold"").  The boba tea is delicious--they used to have fruit bits for the ""pearls,"" which made for a more interesting drink.   Sadly, they've returned to tapioca only.Visit the Newberry Road shop if you have a choice--the Archer Road location is more difficult to get to/park at, more disorganized, and the food isn't as skillfully prepared.  The rating takes a star hit on behalf of the second store--it's that bad."
7/15/2015,5,"This is a staple for me in Gainesville. I have never had a bad food experience here, and everything I've tried has been excellent.My go-to meal is fried Udon, but the Sushi is really a star here in Gainesville. I recommend getting an executive roll, like Flying Dragon, for a great sushi experience.All regular entrees have been great. My favorite is Broccoli (Kung Pao).I prefer Newberry Bento over Archer. The atmosphere is much nicer and you generally don't have to wait in line outside the door."
6/30/2008,4,I just discovered the joy of putting Sriracha sauce in my veggie rice bowl.I can feel that ulcer coming.
6/15/2011,3,Went here while in town searching for housing in the area with the husband. We had some sushi and the general Tso's rice bowl. The sushi was good but the rolls need to be better rolled as they fell apart as you pick them up. The general Tso's rice bowl has tasty but I feel it could have been spicier.  The tables that we sat at where sticky and probably could have been wiped down alot better between customers. The final decision: I would go back again. Food was decent and worth another try.
6/10/2017,1,Paid for over-fried chicken and more sauce than rice in my bowl. I couldn't even bite thru the rubber chicken so I paid to throw it away. The kitchen staff really should learn to cook something that they themselves would eat. I understand they probably don't get paid enough to care that much but it's killing this business because I'm not the only one who knows how terrible they are. Never going back to bento. Step up your game! Smh
12/26/2013,1,"Nothing like the Bentos in Orlando. very disappointing.  the food not really that good and the service. What service. you order,and  dont ask questions. If you want fast food atmosphere and don't care about polite workers , its your place. I realize its a College town but taking my order and being rude doesn't justjfy me putting money in a tip jar. Very very dissapointing. I won't be back."
11/17/2014,3,"Love their Bento boxes, especially the chicken katsu. Crab wontons are good. I have yet to try the sushi here though. They have decent food & atmosphere, unfortunately they don't stand out to me when deciding on dining options. I tend to only go here when others suggest. They're not bad, just not exceptional either."
12/22/2014,5,"My boyfriend and I love this place. He gets the Mongolian beef rice bowl, and I get the Mexican roll. Other favorites of mine are the crunch, masarap, and Florida rolls. Their spicy mayo is also the best around."
9/23/2014,4,"Great food and a good price.  My go-to place for something quick and delicious.  Bento boxes are always great,  but the spicy beef udon noodle soup is my favorite!"
4/28/2017,4,I'm an extremely loyal constumer to Bento. I love their sushi rolls and bento boxes. The Archer road one has better delivery service and can actually follow direction. AMAZING SUSHI. Go to place for anytime and good teas! Manger at Newberry one is extremely rude and disorganized.
7/5/2014,5,"Okay, I love Bento. They have a ton of selections. My brother got the general tso bento box and it was pretty good. I got the create-a don which a create a sushi bowl with salmon,crab and shrimp. I loved it! Gotta have the spicy mayo though. I thought the Starburst (strawberry banana) milk tea boba was okay, but the actual boba balls were made just right. Can't wait to try more when they open one in Tampa hopefully soon! The prices aren't bad either."
8/24/2014,5,I love bento! Best place in Gainesville for a quick Asian meal. I went here probably 500 times in college and ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box 95% of the time. I also drowned everything I got in spicy mayo so everything was great.
8/29/2010,4,"I originally hated this place, but it was one of my girlfriend's favorite places to go, and I have to say that it has grown on me. I really like it now and have been tons of times. I especially like this location, as opposed to the one on Archer Road. I usually get the sweet and sour chicken bento box, and most of the time at the Archer location the chicken is soggy and tastes much worse than the chicken from the Newberry location. Also, this place has some pretty good sushi. It definitely isn't the best I've ever had, but most of the times I have gotten it it has been very good. I also get the Boba teas every once in a while and they are definitely worth a try as well."
3/14/2015,3,"The Bento Cafe is one of my family's favorite places to go for lunch. The sushi and noodle bowls are our go-to orders. I usually get the create-a-roll with steamed shrimp and tuna, and the fish always tastes extremely fresh. The only complaint is that it takes a long time for the food to get to the table. If I order sushi, it takes at least 25-30 minutes for it to arrive. Whereas if my Dad orders a beef teriyaki noodle bowl, he gets his food within 10 minutes. As a result, by the time I get my sushi, my Dad has already finished his meal."
12/6/2016,4,Very good casual Asian kitchen and sushi. I love their chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Even the veggies are great in it. Teriyaki and white sauce are amazing. Sushi is above average but the price reflects it as it's not very expensive for the rolls compared to Japanese in the area. Good atmosphere. Archer road location is much bigger and better in my opinion
7/26/2014,5,"Great food, great daily freebies and deals, even options for low-carb eaters! Their sushi is amazing, but you can definitely load up on food for cheap with their Bento box.  Their garlic ginger chicken is to die for! Limited indoor seating, but they do have an outdoor area and delivery options."
1/15/2017,3,Bento is good as far as food is concerned but their customer service was poor today. My wife's order was forgotten and delivered much later than my meal. It is understandable that mistakes can occur but one of the cooks eye rolled my wife when she was just wanting to know if their was a mistake. The waitress was understandable and just checking with the chef. This is by no means a condemnation but just a poor response.
12/23/2013,4,Went there on my birthday and had the pork chop udon soup which was AMAZING! I don't recommend getting the bento boxes because I always find the noodles and green beans too salty. Service was quick but the only complaint was that the cashier wasn't really paying attention and she forgot my boba tea order....
10/9/2015,5,All time favorite. We moved to WA State and still get our Bento fix in every time we come back. 5 words...Curry Katsu Chicken Noodle Bowl. Enough said.
4/18/2012,4,"Out of all the sushi places that I have been to around town Bento definitely has the best deals. You cannot beat the prices to the amount of meat you get in a sushi roll. Usually many places skimp on the ingredients but not this place. Their dons (sashimi rice bowls) are also a good choice to make on the menu, as they also give you a lot for your buck. They also have deals on certain days that if you buy two rolls a free order of edamame comes with it. Aside from sushi, the restaurant provides an array of cooked food as well. Ranging from teriyaki chicken to curry which are all decently sized. However I must warn that if you come on a weekend be prepared to wait for your food because the place does get packed and the service gets slow. Overall a good place to eat at with reasonably priced food. Will come back again."
7/17/2016,4,"I love bento. I may even be borderline obsessed. It's my first stop every time I come back home to visit my family. But seriously, this has been a consistent problem for the last few years: WHY THE HELL IS EVERY SURFACE IN THE STORE ALWAYS SO DAMN STICKY? The chairs! The walls! The tables! The freaking drink machine !!!?!?!!!"
9/6/2015,2,great service but my rolls of sushi were falling apart. wish there was a wasabi in Gainesville.
6/21/2011,1,"Won't be back. I ordered a simple green tea and a veggie delight roll which the server told me was vegan. The green tea had tons of sweetner in it and was $6! The server exchanged it for a glass of water when I said I wanted unsweet green tea. I waited about 20 minutes for one sushi roll and guess what...they messed up my order and served me a veggie delight roll with cream cheese (not vegan). When I told the manager, so offered to pay me for the difference and I had to demand a full refund. She never even offered to remake the roll to fix their error. She made it seem like I was a bother to her"
4/22/2011,3,"I realize that I like this place way more than I should.  I wanted to give four stars but simply couldn't in good conscience.  Let's say that these three stars are really 3.5.   This Bento is always packed with a line out the door at peak meal times.  That being said, I would expect that they would have a more efficient ordering system.  Instead there is only one register manned by 3-5 college aged girls that are confusingly taking phone orders and my order simultaneously.  Somehow it all gets figured out, but the ordering process takes forever.     I like to order the chicken red curry bento box.  In a fast food type place like Bento, I would never expect that the curry would be spicy, but it is, nice and spicy, yum.  I usually have to doctor it up a bit because its a little bland, but with a little spicy eel sauce and a touch more sriacha it tastes just the way I like it.  The bento box comes with Lo Mein noodles (uncharacteristically my favorite part), rice (more carbs please), stir fried green beans, crappy wilted ginger salad, and some version of a little debbie dessert.  Ok, I know this doesn't sound too great, but again I like it so much more than I should.  I crave this sad little plate of fast Asian fusion, I realize its wrong, but it feels so right.   The thing about Bento is that the service is awkward.  I always go with a friend or two, and the food never comes out together.  I feel strange diving into my dinner while my date waits for his/her meal to arrive.  If you wait politely, however,  you will wait forever, sometimes food has been spaced as much as ten minutes apart...awkward.  All that being said I still love this place, I think the kicker for me is the self service sauce bar.  The bar has sriacha, eel sauce, spicy eel sauce, shrimp sauce, and spicy mayo.  I love being able to gluttonously gorge on these sauces without facing the shame of actually asking for them.     I visit Bento usually once every two weeks, with no intention of stopping.  I may never understand my strange Bento addiction, but love can be perplexing."
12/20/2015,5,When ordering our food the woman was so helpful and nice and the food came out fast and hot! I had the Spicy Cream chicken Noodle Bowl lo mein and it was delicious! My family enjoyed their noodle bowls as well. My cousin order sushi but it took very long and when she asked about it they apologized and have her a $5 gift card for the wait. Overall great place! Great food and service!
3/17/2016,4,The bowls are large portions. I recommend the spicy cream chicken and the peach green tea.
3/15/2012,2,Meh it's ok !! Maybe I'm a sushi snob but I'd rather pay more and get better quality.  Not really a fan ...  I mean it wasn't the worst place ever but I'd rather eat elsewhere.
8/3/2016,4,"I'm relatively new to Gainesville, and was sad to leave my old regular Asian food fix behind, and have tried out quite a few, and so far Bento Cafe has been pretty decent! I've only ordered in from here, and gotten mostly the same thing. My first time was from the place on Archer Rd from the hotel I was staying at, and comparatively I did enjoy it better! The first time I ordered from here though, I actually didn't enjoy it very much. My food was cold & ended up getting sent the wrong thing (I asked for rice and instead for lo mein with my katsu, and everything was awful except the miso soup I ordered, the lo mein noodles were bad and there was absolutely no flavor to it and the chicken was just...bad). This next time around I got a thing of miso again since it didn't disappoint, and instead got the fried rice bowl, and both were AMAZING, everything was nicely cooked (still a little cold but not as bad as last time) and the flavor of the fried rice really hit the spot. It definitely doesn't replace my old place, but this time around really made up for the first bad experience, I'm excited to eat from here again!"
1/19/2012,2,"i ordered to-go here (for the first time) and this is what happened:i had a very sad, long, complex day -- one that calls for yummy food over rice -- and i didn't feel like dealing with bento bros. so i ordered something new (gasp), the spicy creamy shrimp rice bowl, and a chicken teriyaki bowl for the boy. i also ordered an almond milk tea with mango jellies. yes, i ordered mango jellies and strayed from the usual tapioca pearls. call me crazy if you'd like.the milk tea was fine, but the jellies were scarce. they were good, and that made it even worse. there weren't even really enough to see them at the bottom of the cup. i had maybe a tablespoon of them in there.the spicy creamy shrimp, i found out when i got home, was chicken. it was fried chicken mixed with a sweet sauce and sauteed in their spicy mayo. i love their spicy mayo. this was pretty disgusting. it reminded me of an extremely bad take on the dim sum walnut shrimp -- and it was chicken. the breading wasn't even crispy. it was like someone fried it in funnel cake batter, very pancake-y.the teriyaki chicken was meh. the sauce wasn't thick like teriyaki sauce is supposed to be. it tasted just like a sweetened soy sauce.i was trying to choose between bento and mi apa for dinner, and i really should have listened to advice and gone for mi apa. dammit."
2/25/2010,4,"oops . . . accidentally posted the review for the other location here!  so i'll write this one too . . . this is the ""original"" bento . . . and what *made* this location special was that they had traditional taiwanese dishes that were on small slabs of wood posted on the column next to the ordering register . . . they had xue hua rou si mien (snow bowl) which was one of my (and my dad's) favorites . . . unfortunately, apparently not enough people ordered it and they took it off the menu . . . but anyway, their schezuan beef noodle soup is another great choice."
1/6/2009,3,"The place is unique and the prices aren't bad.  But I think the food could be better.  Giving it a 3 stars b/c it was one of the first places I found in Gainesville that had the asian milk tea, which isn't too bad considering they use powder but a little pricey.  The food was ok, sushi wasn't anything special.  It's a place you go once in a while to change things up and different atmosphere."
8/18/2010,5,This place def. gets five stars in my book....why? Because its super cheap and delicious!! I love their sashimi bowls...and of course their spicy mayo!!! I really don't like their bento boxes but if you do decide to get one...katsu chicken or fish is def. the best!!! :)
11/21/2009,4,"What can I say, when I am in Gainesville, Bento is defiantly on the to-do list. The Miami roll is to die for, I have dreams about it. The Bento boxes aren't too bad either. They consistently deliver great food."
6/28/2013,5,This is my favorite sushi in Gainesville! My husband and I come here all the time. It's great. He loves the spicy cream shrimp!
12/21/2010,2,"pad thai really bad.extremely dry, 2 layers of noodle and bottom layer was just boiled noodle. not authentic too commercialized"
8/11/2011,4,"Really good sushi and the bento box chicken was good,"
11/11/2015,5,"I go here once a week at least. So many good options! Try the spicy tuna don. Or if you don't like rice, the kawaii roll is a fresh and delicious alternative to a normal sushi roll. Food comes out fast and perfect every time"
9/28/2009,5,I have had some Bubble Teas close enough to compare.  The pearls at Shing Wang in North Miami Beach are much better; but I will have to return since Bento Cafe is the only place I can find that has Pineapple flavored milk teas.  Sigh...
8/16/2011,5,"You can't go wrong for the price...but Red Bentos is better because it has Jasmine Milk Bubble Tea! I love the sushi boxes, donburis, and spicy cream shrimp."
10/15/2009,2,"I have heard a lot of good things about this place.  When I lived in japan bento boxes were a staple.  I was excited to try this place.  The price is very reasonable, the menu has a lot of options and the boxes are cleverly put together.  My wife's sushi looked good and my sister in law's Unadon looked and smelled great.  This place showed that the owners know their stuff.  It is nice to be able to get a variety of japanese, thai and chinese food.     The gripe that I have and my explanation for an ""I've experienced better"" was that my Chicken Katsu did not have the Katsu sauce on it.  I was looking forward to that taste.  Had I known that they didn't serve it that way it wouldn't have bothered me.  The sauce was a spicy japanese mayo (which was good).  When I asked the server for some katsu sauce she responded ""soy sauce?"" I said no the katsu sauce.  She pointed out the spicy mayo and said that is how they serve it.  I'm not one to aggravate the people who handle my food, so I said ""not the  Japanese katsu sauce?  oh, ok.""        I was a little frustrated at the server's shortness and her hurry to get back behind the counter.  I was surprised because the quality of the food I got for 7.50 was great and the smartly put together menu makes me think the absence of a sauce named after the food is a little weird.  Maybe my server was a bum and couldn't wait to get back to socializing.      I would go back and give it another try.  I would order the same thing again even without the beloved katsu sauce.  I want to try the donburi, but am a little nervous about what sauce they may substitute. If the service is better and at least don't act like I am making a crazy request I will probably change my rating to a 3 or maybe even a 4 star."
12/7/2012,3,"This bentos isnt as good as the bento red on archer, but it's still ok. Their bentos and noodle bowls are both pretty good, but dont seem to be as good as their red location. It's not ""authentic"" but it is good. The decor is well done to look trendy with a blue and black theme. Like the other one, its a good place to go to grab a bite with some friends."
11/10/2007,3,"This is a nice spot with fairly fast service and decent food.  The service is also great and the staff is friendly.  However, I am unable to comprehend why people absolutely ADORE or LOVE this place...it really is not worthy.  Their sushi is OK, not spectacular but the price is right for the quality you get.  I like the ambiance, it's black tables with dimmer lights..so people look less ugly. Over all the place is good but far from great.  It gets great business but they are also serving  the huge crowd of white UF college students who think california rolls are sushi."
8/21/2006,3,A great casual pan-asian eatery by the Newberry movie theater.  Bento boxes and sushi are good dishes to try here.  One of the few places to have bubble tea.  Watch out for the service - the cashier/waiter has messed up mine and my friends' orders on multiple occasions.
10/22/2008,4,"Sometimes you just need a quick bite to eat at a decent price. I wouldn't recommend going all out here on a dinner, but its got its value in my selection of restaurants."
7/7/2010,3,"For what it is (casual, affordable, and tasty) i give it 5 stars... I had a mexican sushi roll, which is tempura shrimp, avocado, cream cheese, and it was delicious...also had a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, pretty good. they have specials, and since i went on a tuesday, it was ""2-for-1"" teas. I went for thai iced tea...it's a pre-packaged tea, but nevertheless, tasted great. I'll be back when i'm in the area for work :)"
8/11/2011,4,"Great alternative when everybody wants to go to Moe's. I am not a huge fan of Moe'sbut will go here anytime. My friends and I always eat outside in between Moe's and Bento's have grown to call it ""m-entos"""
7/16/2012,5,This place was awesome.  The menu selection is not overwhelming but have tons of choices.  The food was authentic and very good.  My kids loved the soda dispensing machine.  It was a little costly but still very worth it.
6/25/2011,2,"I have eaten here three times. The first was horrible but I thought maybe it was just because they were busy, so I came back and it was decent, the third time was once again horrible. The rolls are sloppily rolled, the fish was tough and low quality. I have had better sushi at the grocery store- which is sad. It you want good sushi just spend an extra two bucks and go to a higher quality local, or just hit up Publix down the street."
8/19/2012,5,So delicious! Everything was great from service to the food and even the atmosphere! The decor is trendy and so cool looking. Very clean. Anything on the menu is great so don't feel too picky! Plus it's inexpensive for the amount of high quality food you get.
7/16/2006,4,"This place was one of the original pan-asian cafe's in gainesville.  They used to have something called a snow bowl (which was amazing), unfortunantly they no longer offer that for dessert (which is why they don't get 5-stars from me).  The food there is good and there is a wide selection of bento boxes, noodle bowls, rice bowls, and sushi selections.  The milk tea with pearls is excellent and if you are extra thirsty you can super-size it!.  I particularly enjoy the Szechwan Beef Noodle Soup, Spice Chicken Noodle Bowl, and Curry Catzu Noodle Bowl.  Also they have the best hot and sour soup in town (the most authentic that I have tasted in gainesville)."
7/27/2007,4,"Eat here all the time. Both locations are fun, friendly, good selection of sushi and noodle bowls. Bento boxes are great value. I have never had a negative experience at either one.Love the environment...it's counter service, but friendly delivery ..."
7/27/2015,4,"Very tasty for a good price. Never had the sushi, but the spicy creamy chicken is my fave. Young staff can be a little testy, but overall good experiences there. Line can be very long so I'd call in your order. Not a ton of indoor seating. Still four stars for tastiness."
3/6/2008,3,"In the spirit of full disclosure, my girlfriend and my barber got violently sick after eating the vegetable noodle bowl and a bento box. This could be a fluke. That said, I still like this place.Generically very asian. Great place to bring kids or people who don't like foreign food. Not too pricey. Fare share of students hanging out but not obnoxious or greek."
4/10/2010,4,Great sushi at best price and ambiance. You can have a great sushi meal without going broke here. Always busy because of this.
7/30/2011,4,"Bento Blue (Archer Rd. is Bento Red):  awesome prices, fast and friendly service, big parking lot and no upcharge for spicy sauce!  They're hitting all the right buttons for an awesome place (unlike Bento Red).  Cons?  its small and dark inside.  The music is really loud.  Its sort of like walking into Hollister."
6/22/2009,1,"Well, my partner and I were quite impressed with the reviews we saw on here and being fans of oriental, vegetarian food decided to try it out. We were disappointed- for $8 the portion size was tiny (my partner had to get a meal at Taco Bell- unfortunately - because he was still starving! ) and not satisfying (and I'm not a big eater!) We ordered the box deal - Red Curry Tofu- and the tofu wasn't prepared in any special way just basically cut up and chucked into hot sauce (not even brazed or lightly cooked..) I would definitely recommend going to Chopstix instead if you want a good tofu dish. And the special 'sides' they give you in the box were minuscule as well with the salad being about two forkfuls and the beans just as much- good place to go if you are watching your portions!"
10/13/2011,4,"You know, I like Bento. I prefer Bento Blue (Newberry) to Bento Red (Archer), if only because the latter is often crowded and kind of unorganized.The sushi is pretty good (and pretty cheap), and the Boba tea (almond is my favorite -- with pearls, which are made of tapioca and make for a really interesting drink experience) is fantastic. I would probably go to Bento just for some Boba tea."
5/15/2015,4,"Love this place for a quick Asian cuisine. Not pricey, nice atmosphere. Sometimes they get really busy but that's because everyone in town loves them. The sashimi tuna is my favorite, comes with avocado which I love! Their udon noodle bowl is my second favorite."
11/23/2008,5,"I like this place a lot. I highly recommend the tea with the pearls in it. It's crazy, but good. I really enjoy coming here with friends because it has a modern feel and we all love our sushi! I look at it as a Panera Bread but a sushi place."
11/14/2010,3,Good asian fusion. Good lo mein. Fast-food-ish.
11/3/2014,5,My daily sushi go to. Can't beat the price for the quality sushi. Can get very busy so calling ahead and getting take out and sitting outside it a good idea. Daily specials too
2/1/2013,5,"I used to work in Gainesville and my co-workers and would go to Bento every Monday for lunch. Great food, great value, great restaurant. It's one of the few places I miss in Gainesville."
10/28/2014,3,"The food is great, but the service tends to be terrible. Borderline rude employees and slow service are the norm. If you call in a pickup order and they say 20 minutes, give it at least 30 and on occasion nearly 45 before you actually get your food. It's just frustrating and they never seem to acknowledge how slow they are."
12/24/2014,5,We love the food and service here and it is one of our regular places to eat.  I have been bringing my two children here since they were in utero and we've always had good service and felt welcome here.  I usually order sushi or bento boxes.  Love their seasonal selections.   Everything is cooked and seasoned right and their employees are nice.
2/22/2010,4,"Can't say enough good things about Bentos. Everything is good, from bento boxes to sushi to bubble tea. My only complaint is the parking and seating arrangements. Sometimes the place is so crowded that you can't find parking (not their fault mind you) and you get inside and there's no tables. Frustrating when you want Bentos!"
9/14/2012,5,"5 stars for sushi in its price-category. The consistency of Bentos is amazing- especially for the reasonable prices. I've probably eaten Bentos 100+ times- more pick up than eat-in. My favorite = gator roll (w/ side of spicy sauce), steamed dumplings, miso soup, and strawberry shortcake bobo tea with pearls- though some people prefer without pearls. As an aside, the staff seems really happy- like they have good camaraderie- I think happy people take more pride in their food."
11/11/2012,5,"Bento is always good!  I always get the same thing: Chicken Broccoli Rice Bowl.  I also get the blended ice teas and sometimes the miso soup.  The miso soup is great if you have a sore throat!  My hubby has made a habit of getting the spicy chicken noodle bowl, and I always steal a couple pieces of his chicken.There are 2 locations in Gainesville, and if I had to pick, I'd prefer the Bento Red on Archer Rd, only because of service.  The girls that work at Bento Blue on Newberry Rd just always seem stuck up to me, but Bento Red has always been nice.  Either way, the food here is so good that I won't discount Bento's rating because of Bento Blue's shortcomings.  The restaurant is in fact in the fast food category, and service at fast food places tends to lack compared to sit-down places anyway.Overall, Bento deserves 5 stars in my opinion, and I regularly eat dinner here."
7/18/2009,4,"This is a great place for lunch or a quick casual dinner.  Atmosphere is sort of techno-hip --- I much prefer to sit outside than inside that dark, noisy room.  But the lunchbox is a tasty ensemble that breaks out of the fast food mold.  Service is always polite and attentive.  Every entree I've tried has been delicious.  (The dining-hall dessert cake is sort of a joke however).  Prices are very reasonable.I have just one complaint, which is that TWICE I've been served stale, skunky beer.  I guess they have a mostly student crowd and they don't sell that beer very fast.  Skip the beer!"
7/8/2011,4,"I had a great time eating here, the large screen TVs make this location a great place to enjoy a football game while eating your food. The food itself is extremely well made and the portions are hearty. The selection of food and drink types is also very wide and well done."
7/3/2008,2,"If the concept of metropolitan Asia could manifest itself into a haze of some sort, fill a room, and shout at you, that would be fairly close to the atmosphere experienced here. But if you're unfortunate enough to be in this area, your other options are Moe's and Bonefish or some bullshit, so you may as well get some rice or something here."
12/29/2010,2,"I had heard great things about this place, so I decided to venture away from my favorite sushi place in town. Upon walking in, I feel like I am in a mad dream with a mix of my junior high school cafeteria, a techno bar, and a run down McDonalds. Upon entering, you grab a large laminated sheet which is the menu. Then you walk along a half wall to get to the register. You place your order (don't dare ask for any special sushi dish because they have never heard of things which aren't on the menu). You then go sit down. The tables are small, no booths and are stocked with only low sodium soy sauce. You then take your flimsy plastic cup to the drink dispensers (think Moe's with less space). Then you have the option to get sauces. Unlike Moe's cute little sauce bar, you are met with giant pump dispensers which don't work very well. The spicy mayo has way to much of a grocery store mayonnaise flavor. The eel sauce is also very plain. The sushi we ordered was brought to the table. All three rolls tasted very similar - each overpowered by the large chunks of cream cheese inside. The sushi rice was good, the eel was too warm, the shrimp tempura was above average. Oh, also, no coke products. We ordered a coke and a sprite and were given cups only to find Pepsi products after paying (blah!). I saw no Japanese people behind the counter. A decent fast food type joint if you don't mind the techno music playing along with sports on one tv and an Asian B movie on the other. Nothing exciting."
9/3/2010,2,For the price point it is a deal but the food isn't that good.  All the bento boxes disappointing you can get just about everything they put in it at a buffet. Like the little square cake.  The sushi is just average but hay it's fast food sushi style.  It might have been trendy when it first opened but over time those trendy thing become dated.  Not very clean most of the time.  I'll only go if I'm desperate for something to eat.
10/22/2012,4,"I think I've only eaten here twice or three times in person, but I've lost count of how many times I've ordered take out from here. Their Bulgogi Noodle Bowl is on of my favorites. It's not the best service, but the food is great. If you're hungry, don't be shy about hitting Bento up."
2/5/2011,4,Cheap sushi without really cutting the quality. Not the freshest but definitely better than publix sushi or the sushi bars at any chinese restaurant. You can't get much better for the price. Love to get the take out orders.
11/1/2013,4,"i'm really writing this for my wife. she is a big fan. we both like this corner since it has a nice variety of food options for us, namely moe's, coldstone, coffee culture, gators dockside and this place. i have also ate here a few times. the food is good, not the best sushi in town, but good. if you judged by the lines, people must find this place freakin' awesome 'cause it seems to almost always have a line. one thing my wife likes alot is their endless dispenser of spicy mayo sauce. they recently introduced a children's menu. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get."
12/9/2022,5,Love their poke bowl. I sometimes prefer it over sushi because not too much seaweed but my fave all time of their sushi roll is hot lava. It has all my fave toppings in it. Really recommend for lunch or dinner when catching up with a friend or small gatherings
11/15/2022,3,"Went here with some friends from out of town the other weekend. Our experience was... average? I've settled on ""average"" for 3 main reasons: 1. The service was fairly slow despite us being one of two sets of guests in the restaurant. 2. Our food was good, but for the price, could have been better. 3. Our meal was interrupted constantly by blaring music. Don't get me wrong, I love ""Man in the Mirror"" just as much as the next guy, but when my friends and I are having to yell over the music to communicate, that's when it becomes overbearing. It sounds like such a silly detail, but when you can't hear your friends and then eat quickly so you can leave and go somewhere quieter, it becomes a little less silly.All in all, our experience wasn't bad. This is a new and very clean location. Our food came out hot and tasted as you'd expect for a Bento. Nothing really wowed us, but that's not to say we wouldn't come back. Although, next time we might decide to drive to the Town Center Mall location instead."
9/16/2022,1,"9-16-2022 *UPDATE*Apparently they no longer have udon soup as an option here. This was the only saving grace since the sushi is so generic. Now, I won't be back at all. Thanks for ruining the closest place I could get udon soup at."
12/4/2022,3,"Great food. Okay service, no one was there. Clean and quiet ambiance was laid back. I came during closing time and the online order said they were out of general Taos. When I came inside they actually had it on the menu. Wait time was short. Wouldve liked to try the bubble tea,  but the young lady said they were out. I would come back again!"
12/21/2022,3,"This used to be a go to for me in college. While the menu is essentially the same, I unfortunately didnt find my food to be that way. When we ordered our food they told us it will take 30 min which would be fine, but it wasn't unusually busy. I ordered a bento box and the chicken was just ok."
3/20/2021,5,Can't go wrong with a Bento Box. Bentos was my first real experience in a BOX at their first location. Their second RED was a upscale of what I already loved but with a cocktail on the side. Bentos Riverside is visually welcoming. The same great food and Boxes. Menu is very accommodating to all pallettes The soft opening was professionally handled with no wait or issues. Do I wish it was a Red.. yes but they are here in my area now so that's a celebration! See you again at my lunch times soon!
3/8/2021,4,"This particular location of Bento Asian Kitchen and Sushi is located on Riverside Drive in the Brooklyn Plaza. They have a sign stating that they are in soft opening at this time. If you have ever had been towed Asian Kitchen and Sushi before, you will know that it is a decently priced alternative to get some decent Sushi and they have very good poke bowls.There are a lot of restaurants around this establishment, so they might have some stiff competition. However, there are also a lot of apartments right behind them. If you are unsure and how to find them they are located next to the Chop Barbershop and the Chipotle. All in all, I would recommend this establishment. I will advise you though that they are currently in a cashless operation, so make sure you have a debit card or a credit card."
4/6/2022,2,"I've eaten at the Gainesville and Town Center locations numerous times and the food was always great but this location the food is just ""off."" Considering Bento is a chain, I assumed the food would be the same at every location i.e. same recipes, flavor, etc. but that was not the case. I had the fried rice here and it was terrible. So mushy and very weird flavors. Not like fried rice at all or anything like what I've received at the other locations. If you want Bento I would recommend you go to a different location if possible."
5/1/2022,5,Bento box has good fried rice and tasty meat. Loved it!  Wow wow wow wow!  Go see for yourself. The service is great too.
2/20/2022,1,"I'm sorry guys. I walked in here and there were 4 people. I waited for 52 mins for a Togo of the pao pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and a ginger salad. It's good, it always is. I watched the restaurant gradually go from 3 people to 16 before anyone got food (aside from online orders). Do yourself a favor and hit up the other location in jax. Maybe drive to the one in Gainesville, you still might get your food quicker."
11/2/2021,1,"Ordered delivery. She got a poki bowl, I got red curry shrimp with extra vegetables and brown rice. Delivery guy had to give it to me gingerly because the food had leaked in the bag & the bottom had busted. Her bowl was good. Mine? Where do I begin? I thought I ordered red curry with shrimp & extra vegetables but I got a salad with 5 shrimp that had no flavor, my veggies were cooked just enough to knock the chill off of them. All the vegetables were completely raw.(bell pepper, green beans, carrots, mushrooms and broccoli) I thought maybe the curry sauce would be at the bottom with the rice but alas, no. Maybe a spoonful of curry sauce. Not even enough to make my nose run. After complaining to DoorDash they took $8 off of the $15 I paid. So I'm good from ordering again, because truthfully I'm worried the shrimp are going to make me sick being it was all raw..."
11/10/2021,2,"the staff was alright but the food took over 20 mins to come out. I was in a time-limited situation to make it to my therapy session. The divorce is hitting hard so i WAS NOT satisfied with this meal. 2/5 stars. Also the edamame(green beans) were just bland :(. sad face on the prices too, pretty expensive."
5/27/2021,5,"I have had Bento before from other locations but this was my first time trying the food at this one. I ordered a catering order for my graduation party and they didn't disappoint! We got the spicy cream chicken (it's called the Pao Pao now), lo mein, orange tofu, and krab wonton platters. The chicken and tofu platters also came with rice. The portions are huge! We ordered for 11 people originally but I had about 16 attend my graduation party and there were plenty of leftovers. We paid $254 for the whole order (but also make sure you tip for the catering orders too). You can see the portion sizes in the attached pictures. The egg rolls were not part of the catering order as my mom made those. For the food review: the spicy cream chicken and krab wontons are my favorite. The orange tofu was just ok, a little too sweet but we ordered it since the majority of my family is vegetarian. Thank you Bento Riverside! We were happy to be your first catering order!"
7/26/2022,2,Kitchen is very slow. Noodles were over cooked. No cell reception and no Wi-Fi. Overall an unpleasant experience
11/15/2021,1,"I'm a huge fan of Bento. I've been to every Bento we have in Jacksonville, and even visited the Orlando location when I've been traveling through. I have tried almost everything on the menu and am always impressed with the sushi, poke bowls, noodle bowls, and bento boxes. Really, the food is the only thing redeeming about this location.As someone who has been to multiple locations, I've noticed each place is a little different depending on their work culture. Some have great service, some just have okay service. This Bento, however, is the worst service. Staff was rude, I waited thirty minutes for my to-go noodle bowl, and when I realized other people after me in large parties were getting their food, I asked about my order. Staff cold-shouldered me and just said they were short-staffed. I completely understand that right now, more than ever, staff is hard to find. I am totally patient. But when you are rude and impatient with me for asking a polite question, I am immediately turned off. I finally gave up and asked for a refund, and was treated with more attitude. A manager came out, did not speak to me, did not apologize, did not ask me what happened, and just said ""put your card in"" and walked away. I will not be returning to this location."
6/28/2021,2,"I've had the town center one plenty of times no issues. But this one is a little off. The TNT roll is made super weird there, the texture is way off. It's gummy and mushy. Tried to show example in picture. The Mt. Fuji is the same though. Great as always"
11/11/2021,3,"I want it to be good! It just isn't. The food is just okay. It's fast and convenient, but expensive and mediocre."
4/12/2021,5,Went in this little spot for lunch today and it was pretty awesome. The food is hot a fresh and they give you plenty. I had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp as my protein. It was super yummy! I can't wait to try more of what they have to offer!
3/19/2021,5,"Finally ordered lunch to go from the newest Bento location in Brooklyn. I called in and placed my order very easily. The woman I spoke with answered any questions I had and helped my coworker and I choose the best bang for our buck. Parking is MUCH easier now with the new parking lot addition. I went around 12:30 pm and there was at least a handful of empty parking spots. They let me split the order in person and pay separately, then it was only a 5 minute wait or so for our food. The inside is super cute with plenty of natural light and fresh atmosphere. I particularly love the cute neon sign! My Sushi Combo box was delicious and filling, and cost about $12. I definitely plan on adding Bento to my lunch rotation!"
4/11/2022,1,"Total disappointment. Thought this place was ""fast casual"" so went for lunch between meetings and after 30 minutes asked where the order was and was told ten MORE minutes (!!). Five minutes later, my CHICKEN came to the table COLD. Thanks for the $17 refund, but I'll never walk back in this place."
4/19/2021,3,The manager contacted me and resolved the issue. However the issue was as you can see in the picture I ordered lo mein and received white rice. Make sure if you order to go you check your order before you go.
7/27/2021,5,"We walked in right before they were closing and everyone was so friendly and so gracious and so welcoming. While they may have been out of a handful of items, the staff really did a great job providing us with our options and we found something everyone liked. The Bento box and sushi rolls were excellent.  Spring rolls and tempura shrimp also fresh and excellent. Loved it and will be back but the staff deserves a raise and maybe some bonuses."
10/16/2021,2,"Employees were nice, but overall the experience was 1.5 stars mainly based on the quality of food - which was just ehh okay - I asked for ""plain"" fried rice for our two young kids (also $7?!) the employees must have misunderstood when I said plain and no egg, they still Included all The vegetables. The kiddos didn't want to waste their time exchanging it. Also ordered the bento box general tso and the portions for $15 was not worth it, small scoop of rice? Fewer pieces of general tso chicken  and lo mein noodles with no flavor SMH. The last items We ordered was the $15 special roll 'hot lava' and Mex roll- let's just say both rolls for the price and quality were very underwhelming and we're not crafted the way a sushi roll is supposed toBe made...and Bento isn't new to us we've been going since they opened in town center area (but have been going less and less since the pandemic, bento red turned to shit too) this fairly new riverside location need some work..also we had to clean our own tables with soy sauce stains on it, I may not be a professional restaurant manager but I'm a customer that observes all the details. Step up on the experience and the prices are way toooo high for the quality! We love to supportBut won't be going back anytime soon!"
10/31/2021,1,"Closes early always. I get it it's COVID but then when I get to the place on a night you don't close early y'all are all just hanging out not trying to work. No wonder this place will be out of business in a year. Ran out of lo mien after I already paid for my food and asked if I wanted something for free... I said no white rice was fine, and then you proceeded to not bring our tea for another 15 min while we eat half of what we ""ordered"" . Y'all are trash. Fire the whole squad"
4/3/2022,3,Head off to whoever cook my food it's delicious lol  hello to the Lang lady at the counter she needs to start smiling more when someone asked her for a condiment she made me feel like I don't know what I'm talking about a restaurant like this place with out salad sauce or condiments for your green salad that's ridiculous. She seems like I bothered hard when I Astor for a sauce for my salad really you work on this place specially an Asian place like this you need to start smiling first every Asian is not nice like me. The lady that serve my food thank you so much is served with smile and again thank you for the cook made my food it's amazing thank you all ready
6/5/2021,5,"I had the chicken katsu and my mom had a poke bowl which was bussin bussin :) their boba is good too! I don't like the paper straw though, since I drink slow I end up with soggy straw. I bought a metal one though so I'll use that from now on."
2/28/2021,4,"The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. The employees are bordering on rude but the food is good and prices are fair. I ordered the chicken fried rice and was told that they were out of bean sprouts, I asked if I could remove the peas and there was some kind of failure to communicate as it took her 5 min to explain that the carrots and peas come together? So I opted to get them as the only vegtables in the fried rice. I did ask if I could substitute peppers or another vegetable for the bean sprouts and was told I would habe to pay extra. I almost walked out, and if my son hadn't brought me, I would have. But I was pleased with my dish."
10/17/2021,1,Staff is rude & by the way - it's a sushi place that when busy won't serve sushi...or so we were just told. Poor excuse for a Bento!
5/15/2021,2,"The cafe was sparkling, new and inviting. The counter help was very informative and answered all of my questions. We ordered a large variety of food that was not too overpriced priced if it was all edible. The noodle soup only tasted of fish oil, the California roll was definitely not fresh as it was gummy in the center. Our foods came to us in very small amounts as the first person was done before the last one was served. We were not given an explanation as to why this happened. The Mongolian shrimp was excellent but small for the price. I think this will be a good cafe once they get their staff to work together but they are not there yet."
3/24/2021,3,"The ambiance of the restaurant is great except we got dark meat in all our bowls. Panda Express carries all white meat and this being a high class Asian restaurant, I expected white meat but it came with dark meat by default. Also the rice is a little mushy and doesn't look fully fried. Taste is good and that is why I gave three stars. Need some cooking improvement."
5/24/2021,5,"Delicious food, healthy and light. Large portions and good variety of options. I like the pok'e bowl, good value and super yum."
3/11/2021,5,Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi is my daughter's favorite place to eat dinner. I tried their poke bowl the last when I went there and it was DELICIOUS. Made me so happy and full. Highly recommend this place for poke bowl.
5/15/2020,4,"Many time visitor - first door dash- The make your own poke bowl is my favorite. I ordered a different one for each family member through door dash. Perfectly and accurately made with a side of delicious veggie spring rolls. They made them visually appealing and ingredients were crisp, fresh, and delicious. Door dash was fast and friendly"
5/12/2021,2,"I was pretty disappointed after finally trying this new Bento location. It has been a couple years since I've had Bento and I liked it when I did. Tonight I drove into Brooklyn and ordered. The staff was friendly and attentive, the food came out fairly quickly and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice. My issue was the food. I got two chicken bento boxes (Mongolian and garlic broccoli), krab wontons and a Thai tea. All together it was $40!!!! The chicken was bland - both flavors tasted the exact same. The whole entire box tasted like frozen pre packaged food you buy at the store and defrost in a pan. The Thai tea was overly sweet with a bitter after taste and I couldn't take more than two sips. The wontons were good but you only get 4 for $5.50 and they barely had any filling. All in all I'm upset I paid $40 for such mediocre food. You can get twice the amount of food for the same price at our favorite Chinese take out and the food is 10 times better."
9/17/2021,1,"While I understand that many businesses are suffering because of the COVID-19 outbreaks and there are staff shortages, it seems like management would have the foresight to do some very simple things like putting a small board up every day to let customers know that they are out of certain dishes. Of the dishes that I tried to order, they were out of yellow curry, brown rice, and sushi in any form. When I finally decided on a Bento box with beef they took the order and then in about 10 minutes came out to tell me that they were also out of beef! When I asked for a manager they couldn't seem to find one and I explained that it would be good if the customers knew what they were out of ahead of time - less stress for everyone all the way around. Additionally, even though they ask everyone to wear a mask until they get to the table the person who took the order had no mask and many of the staff had their mask under their chin. If you're going to ask customers to wear a mask, the staff should be setting an example. The response to my concern was simply ""I'll let my manager know"". It would also be helpful if they just had a coupon of some sort to offer customers when their experience is not that great. Beautiful setting and beautiful interior, but at this point would not come back to this restaurant."
4/4/2021,4,"Overall the food is good. Be prepared with a debit/credit card as they do not take cash. I've been here 3 times now since they've opened. 2 of those 3, the sushi rolls I ordered, fell apart while trying to eat them. The taste was still good tho."
3/21/2021,3,"I ordered the combo box and the crab wontons to be delivered. The wontons were still crispy and quite good.  I ordered a chicken tempura and a Florida. I expected the 4 pieces of tempura to be crispy, but they put the chicken inside a seaweed and rice roll. Not at all crispy! Also,  I didn't know that the Florida roll would have raw fish.  The menu doesn't specify what's in the rolls. So, because I'm home sick,  I didn't eat it. The California roll that's included was ok."
11/22/2022,4,"I was looking for something to eat after shopping at REI and noticed this place. With tofu on the menu, it was a go. You order at the counter and place a number on the table, to have your food delivered to you. It was fast and friendly, and the food was hot and delicious. The place was casual and seemed to be a popular spot for takeout."
8/3/2022,2,"Food was good, but the service and prices ruined this experience. For two people, two dishes and two fountain drinks came out to $35. This was after my boyfriend noticed that he had been charged an additional fee for a shrimp tempura that we did not order and received a refund. The server that handled the refund was not entirely polite and rolled her eyes when he made a simple inquiry about the receipt. Not a great first impression for us with this location.Food took quite a bit of time to arrive but tasted good. May or may not return to this location to see if they have improved any."
12/22/2022,5,"Bento Asian Kitchen was one of the best restaurants we've ever ate at. The food was delicious, and everything was very clean. We would go to Bento 100 more times if we wanted to. The service was quick, and didn't last over 12 minutes. Bento is a 5 star restaurant to us."
4/20/2022,4,"Bento wasn't my first choice, but I needed something quick and convenient between running errands and yoga.Food wasn't bad, just average. It's your typical Asian chain restaurant, so I wasn't expecting anything great. The boba menu is basic, but the jasmine tea was pretty decent. I ordered a veggie roll with a side of eel sauce, which was packaged nicely and affordable, but vastly underwhelming.There are a few other Japanese places across the street I would recommend over this."
3/21/2022,5,"Anytime I'm hungry at Town Center it's a hard sell NOT to go to this place. I love it! The customizable poke bowls hit your fancy no matter what you're craving- Mango, pineapple, edamame, seaweed salad, avocado. Can't decide between rice and salad? Go for both! The salmon is delicious and the spicy tuna will clear out your sinuses. (Read: it's good!) The sauce options are fantastic too, I really like the Yuzu ponzu. It's a little expensive but the portions are large. And they have a nice selection of boba teas, I recommend the Thai boba. Yum!"
12/25/2022,3,"The service was slow. They always have missing menu items. This time was the sweet and sour sauce for the fried wantons. They did no tell us. We just received them late with no sauce. They run out of padtai  and food came slowly. Should they have big to go orders , then you are not told but you may be waiting more than 25 minutes for your order. Corporate should supervise the town center restaurant. They are not train for good and efficient service. It has got worse as weeks go by. Sorry you lost a frequent customer"
7/29/2022,4,"Bento's been around for quite a few years now. The craze had died down awhile now too but this place pretty much still serves the same menu. It still tastes the same way, which is a good thing. Service is still great and staff are still friendly."
11/21/2022,5,"Top tier team at this location. Their efficiency, and kindness is beyond appreciated. There are shortages creating menu holes but they are working with the concern with grace and ease"
6/18/2022,5,"This is my go-to place almost every Sunday after church and as always, I have been consistently getting good service and quality food! I am a little bit confused about reviews who say otherwise. Everytime I am craving for sushi, I go to this place and my cravings are satisfied. We went here tonight for dinner with the fam and perfect timing because it is national sushi day where we can get free sushi when ordering $10 or more. Tonight I ordered volcano roll and my son ordered Mt.Fuji roll. For our free sushi, we got the spicy tuna roll - all of these are super delicious!!!"
11/21/2022,2,"Went to lunch there and the Sushi was fine, I would even recommend it (especially the special mex roll). The staff on the other hand was the exact opposite. Very rude and short with all their customers even though they were not busy. Most the employees were standing around not doing much. They were not helpful either when asking questions about the menu. I would recommend going to Bento, but not this location."
11/13/2022,2,"The quality of this place has decreased significantly since it opened, making me wonder if it has changed owners. My food ended up taking 20+ minutes to arrive, even though the place wasn't very busy. The rice was at room temperature when it got to the table, and the meal itself was only somewhat warm. The tables were also dirty. I watched the staff clean a used table, using a pre-used white rag, with a couple sprays. There was food residue left on that table, and frankly speaking, there was food residue left on all of the tables. Gross. I feel like the staff now does the minimum here, and it shows in the food and atmosphere. My wife felt the similar about her entree - acceptable, but nothing to go back for. We won't be coming back."
10/13/2022,3,Bento has really gone downhill the past year. Came to this location since the riverside location doesn't have udon noodle soup anymore. The cashier must have not paid attention because both my udon noodle soup and my friends were wrong. I asked for no Bok Choy and Wakame. Mine came with bok choy so they had to fix it. My friend asked for plain noodles since they were out of katsu chicken and he doesn't eat tofu or shrimp. He added a combo with coke and an egg roll They were also out of the Dragon Fruit Lemonade even though they still had a sign up for it. So I just had water and ginger salad for my conbo. I let a team member know and she brought mine back out and it was fine. She said there were problems with the particular cashier who took our order and offered to refund my friend when they were finished with their food. It's sad to say I probably won't be back to either location in the future. There's not many noodle places in town so I go where I can.
2/20/2022,1,"Bento disappoints once again! After waiting 30 minutes, they gave us our food with 1 item less. We asked for it and got it. But when we got home, the tofu katsu was replaced with a chicken katsu (see receipt). I CANNOT eat chicken. So I'm starving and have to cook.One day I'll learn my lesson and never go back. Unfortunately, I've friends who like their food. Oh, when we tried calling, no one picks up the phone. Twice."
9/30/2022,5,"We are here on business for three weeks and decided to check out the Bentos , which is one of our hometown favorites! We had dinner this week and we're impressed with the freshness and great taste of the sushi! We had the dragon roll and it was delicious! We will definitely have sushi there again."
10/23/2022,5,"My favorite quick service sushi restaurant, the sushi and poke bowls are phenomenal and the ingredients are always fresh. The service is always quick and friendly."
9/4/2022,1,The service is super suck!!!!!!!! And the price is too pricey. Is not worth the money cuz the food is suck.
12/22/2021,3,"This was my first time here. It was a cold rainy night so I wanted ramen. Except they don't serve ramen here, only udon noodle which was just 2 pieces of bok choy and udon noodle. You can pick a protein but they ran out of chicken and shrimp so I got a side of tofu which sounded good in theory. I thought the tofu would be in the soup but instead it was fried tofu with no seasoning or flavor or dipping sauce. Now I can see why Americans don't like tofu because it's not prepared correctly at Asian fusion places. The inside doesn't seem very clean and the service was a bit rude. Would not be back."
10/26/2022,2,Ran out of a bunch of stuff and offered no alternatives. Not very friendly. Hopefully the food is better than the service!
4/5/2021,1,"Ordered my meal at 4:15pm. Not a real busy time period. Order a Bowl with Udon, shrimp, General Tso style. 20 minutes later a man stopped by and asked if the manager had been by my table yet. I told him, no. I said that they were out of ""the sauce"" to make my meal, would I like something else. He asked if I wanted something hot or sweet. I told him medium, and I told him I would be happy with any bowl, with Udon, and shrimp. 28 minutes later, I received a bowl. It was a bowl with Udon, and fried chicken with hot sauce. 48 total minutes of waiting and not the right food. A little while later, I see him pointing at me to another man who I thought was likely the manager. That man looked at me and I asked him to stop by. He stopped by and I explained things to him. ""Is there something I can get you"", was his question. I said, no, I just thought he should know. He asked if I wanted what I ordered to take home. I said, no. He then left the table. Now... in my world a restaurant manager, owner, person in charge would invite me back on them due to their total ""blowing it"" with my visit. Many time in my past life, I would have refunded their money and invited them back, No... too busy wanting to go over and talk to the other man again. So... some years ago this was one of my ""go to"" places to eat lunch. I must have gone there at least 50 times. After today's today, ""who gives a XXX"" experience, they are now off the list for the future.Now, don't come crying back to me about you might have hiring issues now (their kitchen appeared fully staffed)... because an honest ""I'm sorry and let me invite you back as my guest"" would have turned the situation around. There are simply too many options to have to deal with situations like this... so I will choose not to. Really bad experience... really doesn't deserve the one star. Oh yeah, their drink machine was out of order too. Good bye!!"
5/7/2020,4,"This was my first time trying this place, my mom loves it here so it came highly recommended. We had a poke bowl, Miami roll but I wanted it panko fried and crab wontons, everything was delicious. No complaints! These 3 items came out to $31, but it honestly was quality food, tasty and good portions. Right now due to covid, only outside and take out is available. Can't wait to try some more food off their menu. I was so excited when I saw they offered Japanese white sauce as one of the sauces, yesssssss!!!!"
2/7/2022,1,"Poorly packaged food spilled all over my wifes car. The lids must not have been snapped shut, because these types of containers are usually hard to open. Also, an entire family meal (4 rice bowls and 4 soups) was jammed into one bag... Seperate into two bags and this probably wouldn't have happened.Also, two customers in front of us walked out before ordering because it smelled like sewage. Probably mopping the floors with the rugs down."
2/19/2021,5,"The food is good - but they made a mistake on the order, ya know because they are human! Let's take a chill pill people sometimes mistakes are made - it's what you do with that error that makes a difference. They definitely made it right with sincerity and also comped an appetizer! It gets busy so plan accordingly, and be prepared to wait for sushi"
3/12/2022,5,"Food was delicious the place is beautifully decorated. We were served fast on a Saturday afternoon for dinner. The drinks were very good, my sons got the boba tea. The enrolls (2 per order) super crispy with a sweet and tangy sauce."
12/7/2020,2,I went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was ok. It wasn't amazing but it was not bad either. I asked for it to be spicy and it really wasn't. The lomein noodles were cold and salad dressing wasn't enough for salad. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
9/5/2022,1,I had the chicken katsu and the chicken tasted fake. I've been coming to bento for 2 years and I always get the chicken katsu. Either it was over cooked or something but this is the first time I've had it taste like that. Horrible! And the young lady working at the register wasn't really nice. Food was rly slow to come out too
4/2/2022,3,"Ok. So I usually always get a Bento Box at Bentos and it is always delicious. As of late everything is coming out hot in there Bento Boxes which was not the case a few months back. Anyways, instead of ordering a bento or eating udon soup at my favorite place (Soupa) I decided to try it at Bento. And I have to say that was a mistake! Please don't bother ordering the udon soup at Bento. Stick to eating there bento boxes which are great. Go to Soupa for the udon soup."
10/27/2019,4,"Visited Bento at St. John's Town Center at about 6:30pm on Sunday. There was a small line to order but it moved fast.  After we ordered, the line behind us began to build. Bento serves many different Asian Dishes as well as Sushi. Their Main Menu is set up by picking a base of Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or Bento Box. You then pick one of the many Asian prepared protein options. They also have set dishes and Soups. We ordered the following:Spicy Bulgogi Bento Box with Brown RiceSweet & Sour Chicken Lo Mein Noodle BowlOrange Chicken Lo Mein Noodle BowlHibachi Steak Rice BowlAfter ordering we took our order number to our table. The food didn't take too long to come out. Everything was tasty and filling. The beef was tender and flavorful and the chicken bowls had a nice tang and zest. Depending on your appetite, some of the dishes could be shareable as they are decent portions for the price. Tip:  You get one complimentary sauce per roll, bowl, or box. The white sauce was our favorite (which is the same as Shrimp/Yum Yum sauce from Japanese Hibachi Steakhouses)."
4/15/2022,1,Don't order to go without checking your food. I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp bowl with lo mein to go and it was trash. I would have taken it back if I had the energy to deal with them. The shrimp were literally 1/2 an inch long and COVERED in breading and sauce so it looks like a decent size. Not what I was hoping for at all especially for the price. Shrimp also had the tail attached under the breading so you can't even tell until you're eating something crunchy. Noodles were greasy. Yuck.
3/19/2022,2,"Food was fine, but overpriced for what we received. $15 for a sushi roll you could get elsewhere at the same quality for much less. No complaint about service."
4/22/2022,2,"I always order the Pao Pao™ Rice Bowl which is delicious even though I normally like spicy dishes. so this time I ordered the  Sichuan Rice Bowl which I realize now, it's not spicy either but, it doesn't taste good, it's not seasoned, there's very little chicken and veggies, it's just like eating cardboard. This place it's a one pony deal to me now, I won't venture to other dishes as now I'm afraid it will be bland and flavorless, to think I paid $12 for this! I was hungry so, have to shove in tasteless rice to fill up."
3/14/2022,1,The food so expensive for something so mediocre. The rice was under cooked and the chicken over cooked. I will bet a couple bucks that Panda Express is better than bento. And at this bento location the staff are so rude and gave me attitude about ordering. Live laugh love.
11/14/2021,2,I really hope their kitchen is cleaner than the dining room.... Almost walked out due to the level of filth. We were the first ones in the restaurant at 11am and it was obvious they didn't clean the dining room for the day. The food was good but I'm concerned about the food safety that is observed in the back. We won't be back.
5/20/2019,4,"I was craving poke and this place is conveniently located close to work. I called in my to go order to minimize my wait. Arriving just before noon, the place was relatively full. My poke of white rice, chicken katsu, tempura shrimp, and spicy tuna was good. For toppings I chose edamame, sautéed shiitake mushrooms, masago, and avocado. I also added furikake and scallions along with spicy mayo and poke soy for my 2 sauces. The place filled the bill for my craving and would easily add this to my regular lunch rotation easily to shake things up from the norm."
2/20/2021,5,I ordered the volcano sushi roll. It was absolutely delicious. Place is clean and you're greeted upon arrival. Taking proper social distancing and cleaning measures. Food never disappoints.
11/21/2021,4,"I like the protein bowls.  Never had an issue with service and have always eaten outside, so can't speak to the cleanliness of the indoor eating area.  It's definitely a good fast-casual option for me if I'm the area."
2/17/2020,4,"Bento has been one of my favorites since I moved to Jacksonville 7 years ago. I've always loved there fast service, expansive menu and delicious food (that is always fresh.)It is definitely one of the places that I could eat everyday if I allowed myself to! I often get their build your own poke bowl. The ingredients are fresh, the rice is cooked well and the sauces are on point. I wouldn't say they are the best poke bowl in the area as they aren't as generous with their servings of proteins and you don't have unlimited topping options like Kazu and some of the other similar style restaurants for the price point. But you are guaranteed to be served a meal with quality ingredients. I love this location as it has very large windows that allow you to see the beautiful outdoors. The staff are friendly and it's very clean!Definitely a place to check out if you love sushi!"
6/29/2022,5,"The food tastes great!!!  The staff are friendly and helpful, I love the way that your lunch is packaged!!!"
6/14/2022,1,"Can I give zero stars? Placed an order online and showed up to pick up my order for everyone to just stare at me when I walk in and stand at the counter. Then I am told that my order will be a few minutes, no problem I was a little early. I am headed my order a few minutes later and ask for two shrimp sauces and I'm told that they have to charge me on top of already paying quite a bit for a chain restaurants food for a sauce that for the last four years has always come complementary one with each entrée. Destiny was extremely rude and un-interested in helping me. On top of that, get home... Food was absolutely disgusting. Tasted like it was from the day before"
6/3/2022,1,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars, I really do. From the  workers who don't speak to you no to them not having anything you want in stock half the time. So I I ordered the sesame stir fry double chicken no mushrooms. When my food arrived, there was mushrooms in it. I kindly asked if i could have a remake, they then asked if I had an allergy to mushrooms or if I just didn't want them. Who knows why that matters, regardless you have to remake my food, you served me wrong food. They then came back, with my same bowl, mushrooms picked out of it, and now the chicken is cold. I didn't even bother eating it, I just gave them back the bowl. They then asked me if I wanted a refund. No shit I want a refund. Oh and btw, they didn't give it to me."
10/15/2018,4,"This is a good, solid 4 star establishment. Asian fast food, but really nice quality. My husband and I were in the area and he decided this place sounded the best out of all the choices and I agreed. Not having been here before, we were a bit confused by the menu - not all the dishes were available with the all meat choices, but the lady behind the register was patient and explained how to read the menu, thankfully.My husband had the Asian Cajun Pork noodle bowl. The cashier warned him that it was going to be hot (spicy) and he said that was fine, it was what he wanted. I ordered the Szechuan chicken Bento box with brown rice. (I received no warning about the heat, ironically. LOL) We decided to make it a combo meal for a little extra by adding a drink and a bowl of soup. The clear soup was very good, the mushrooms were super fresh. My husband thinks that was the best clear soup he's had in a very long time. Our meals followed soon after. My husband's Asian Cajun Pork noodle bowl was very tasty, and a wee bit spicy, but did not in any way deserve the ""HOT"" warning he received. LOL We rather thought it was tame. On the other hand, my Szechuan chicken was HOT! Wow! No complaints at all, it was exactly what I wanted, but didn't expect (most places disappoint with the heat). Frankly, he was a bit envious of my dish and was scooping up the extra sauce for his noodles.With both dishes, the green beans were awesome. Seasoned well, cooked, but still with a good crunch. The noodles were good in both, al dente and flavorful. My brown rice was very nice, nutty and soft. All the vegetables were very fresh. The pork in my husband's bowl was very tasty, almost steak-like. The chicken in mine was super tender. The only ""disappointment"" was the salad in my Bento box, but it wasn't bad, just average.We did not try any sushi, but it was very popular while we were there, a lot of people sitting around us had ordered it and it looked really nice.All the workers we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The building was small, but clean. I like that the food was fresh but fast and yet was still served on proper plates. I'm glad we got there early, because by the time we were done eating, the order line was out the door!I do recommend Bento Cafe if you are in this area."
11/17/2018,4,"Ordered: pineapple fried rice with tofuThis location is slightly different from the Deer Lake location; as in it's not your traditional sit down restaurant. You preorder your food, take a number then wait for your food to be delivered to your table. Ive been here a few times and for the most part I like their cooked sushi rolls and their boba drinks. My favorites so far is the Mt. Fuji roll and the taro milk tea boba. As for their other entree items, those are hit or miss. Some really good, some kinda greasy, some kinda bland. The pineapple fried ric that I ordered this time was very flavorful minus the amount of greasy they used. However it did have generous amounts of tofu and pineapple."
11/7/2021,1,"This is not my first experience with bento, but it may well be my last. The staff at this establishment were very unprofessional while attempting to place an order. First, I was told to call back in 15 minutes just to place an order. Then, they said they ran out of rice and noodles. My final attempt to give this company my business resulted with the staff outright refusing to take any orders."
3/27/2022,1,"Terrible food and pricey. Lowest quality sushi and ""Asian food"" Ive ever had. They used to be good, not knowing what happened to them now, should just close the restaurant if the owner doesn't care anymore, let someone else who's talented and passionate about cooking to own the spot."
8/5/2020,5,Extremely well organized take out during COVID - got sushi rolls and Pao Pao Creamy Chicken bowl (think bang bang sauce at bonefish) that was outstanding
11/1/2020,1,When making orders make sure Mara M doesn't take it. She left out my order of Zombie.
5/26/2018,4,"Reasonably priced, Bento features a great menu with several asian cuisine options to choose from. This location at the town center is different from the one one in Tinseltown. The other Bento (Bento Red) is distinguished by a larger size dining area along with live music and a full bar. At this location (town center) I just pay for my food at the register when I order and pick my own seat. At the other location, you have to wait to be seated and you'll have a server assigned to you. My top recommendations:Spicy Cream Chicken- This is THE favorite dish of everyone I've gone to Bento with. Sweet, savory, creamy, and not too spicy. Just a few bell peppers to give the dish a bit of a kick! Sushi: Volcano Special - Best sushi you will ever have. It has shrimp tempura, tuna, cream cheese, avocado with ""krab"" toppings and eel sauce. It's the most beautiful sushi presented to you. Look around at other people eating their sushi and you'll see that they're drooling over yours. I have tried other dishes but these ones will definitely keep you coming back! Bento has an awesome staff too! Very friendly and quick service!"
5/17/2018,3,"I will start with:1. I don't eat sushi but do enjoy the rice bowls and some appetizers here2.  I have come here and had wonderful, quick service before (would usually rate this a 4/5) - but my most recent visit was different. Unfortunately, Today's visit wasn't the most pleasant. All employees were nice, but the service was pretty slow.  We arrived around 11:45, and the lunch rush had clearly begun. (So be sure to plan for a longer lunch if you come here.) My group ordered 4 meals to go and it took 15-20 minutes or so to get our relatively simple orders.  The tea was the worst part.  I had never tried it before, but had a craving for a nice light fruit tea.  I ordered the green tea with pineapple and waited until I got back to work to drink it.  Not sure if it was the artificial fruit mix in or the green tea itself but the tea was just plain DISGUSTING. It almost had a burnt plastic taste to it.  I was very disappointing with that, and probably won't be ordering it again.  These small issues aside, I would return here."
8/27/2019,4,AMAZING: chicken fried rice. Giant portions which means leftovers or you can share with a friend! About $9 for that is a great price. Not so great: don't bother getting Boba tea here. The boba balls are usually underdone and kinda hard in the middle. The tea itself is good just don't waste your money in the boba balls.
6/10/2020,5,"One of our favorites go to in Jacksonville when we want something quick, good and filling. We love the variety and their ever evolving menu. Sometimes one of our favorites gets taken off the menu but we never have a hard time finding a new favorite. My whole family enjoys dining here and we always try to bring our out of town guests there while they are visiting, so they can try out one of our favorite spots. Always two thumbs up from our guests as well.The only thing is sometimes the portions are not consistent."
5/9/2019,2,"Sorry we held up the line as first timers asking a bunch of questions trying to understand their menu and ordering process. My husband tried their Korean rice bowl with chicken and shrimp. He thought the Korean sauce was bland, chicken bland, and shrimp pieces small. I tried the make-your-own poke bowl with spicy tuna, on brown rice, with cucumber, avocado, wakame seaweed salad topped with furikake and spicy mayo sauce. It was meh! Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes for our first time? But we did ask what was popular, so maybe that's their best?Note: also had to use their restroom and the floor was crazy sticky and floor drain open and exposed. Gross!We've bento better."
11/8/2017,4,"I've been coming here for 5 years now and the food is still great, not too expensive and the service is quick. I like their boba tea, delicious and refreshing. The atmosphere is modern, spacious and clean. The wait used to be long during rush hour but ever since Peiwei opened, it's not as busy anymore. It's convenient because Mochi is right next door so I always stop by there after lunch here.My favorite dishes here are the Korean beef, Spicy cream chicken bento box and Fried udon noodles with shrimp."
6/12/2019,4,Love the atmosphere and the food is so good. Mad I didn't know about this place sooner. Currently hooked on the yellow curry. I always have to get extra sauce for all that rice.
4/10/2020,3,"Just ordered this with Uber Eats. I was extremely disappointed. I got the bento box with teriyaki steak. The steak was chewy, the rice was hard, and the salad had no dressing on it. I also ordered the crab Rangoon and no sauce came with it and it was overcooked. I have eaten here before inside the restaurant and it was okay, but I have to say, this time this order was disappointing."
5/10/2017,5,The Sushi in here is so good! I know it's not a fancy restaurant for fancy people who just wants to be fancy (#Fancy) But for someone who is craving sushi on her lunch break. This place is amazing! They serve you right away and you have plenty of time to enjoy your meal during your 1 hour lunch!
2/7/2017,2,"It was just OK after the last few visits.It was THE spot when I was in high school. It was a relatively new concept of having sushi in a chic spot, being seen by your friends and learning how to pronounce names of Asian food properly. They became super popular due to the quick service, easy to read menus and next to a dessert heaven. If you're a coming of age, new to Asian cuisine then by all means you will love this place. But if you're a seasoned foodie with various taste buds then you will probably deem this place underwhelming. I know I did. This is the place to take your easily impress cousin who has never tried sushi before."
12/26/2018,4,"I've really come around to Bento. I used to find it kind of overpriced and meh quality when I can go down the road to a real Japanese sushi place, but they've improved their taste in my mouth so to speak.Their fried rice is honestly really good. I think the addition of bean sprouts is a nice touch since not a lot of places do that, and they include plenty of egg which I like.They have changed the menu a lot and the build your own poke bowl options are my favorite. So is the bulgogi beef. However my go to is usually a noodle bowl with teriyaki beef or chicken on top- drenched in sauce of course.Aside from pretty high upcharges on rolls and the like (to add things like cucumber, extra sauce, etc) nothing has rubbed me the wrong way in a while haha.They also have a huge selection of milk and boba teas, if you're into that."
4/17/2021,5,"We had a great experience here! The food was very fresh and tasty! The manager Kevin, came and checked on us a few times. He was very friendly and made sure our order was correct. We will definitely be back!"
10/10/2018,4,"The food was very fresh and came out very quickly! I had actually gotten a coupon from a yelp event and I was so happy I was able to use it! I got a sushi bento box and it came with a lot of food and it was upgraded to include a miso soup and a drink. My son got a curry steak and it came with a side  salad, noodles and  seaweed salad. Also something fried with a sweet sauce over it. I dont know what it was but i ate it! it was good!! I think his was the way to go...more food! Everything was super tasty! It's nice how they come by frequently and check how your order is. Nice experience!"
7/5/2019,5,"I have come here many times and have never had a bad experience. Whether you are there for dine-in or take out, the food is always delicious. In the last week alone, I have been 3 times and always got a rice poke bowl; nice, light and refreshing option. My second favorite go-to option is the spicy cream chicken in a noodle bowl. Staff is friendly and efficient. Place is clean. This is one of our favorite places to go especially with our picky eater friends because there is something for everyone. Note: It seems to be a better deal (portion wise) to ""build your own"" poke bowl, versus one of the specialty ones. Also, (my only kinda negative opinion): While I appreciate that they have boba, they definitely could be improved upon. The flavor is always kind of off. Not terrible, but not great."
12/29/2018,5,"I was going to attach the initial presentation, but when the food came we all devoured itThe tofu was done perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Pao Pao sauce had the perfect combo of sweet and spicyGinger Salad was average, nothing special hereLo mein was scrumptious Complimentary spicy mayo is a mustGreat Service and Excellent Food! We will definitely be coming back"
10/31/2019,1,If I can give this place a ZERO STAR I WOULD! This place is especially busy during lunch time. Food is subpar and it's more college vibe people eating here. Of course table is not clean and place always look greasy and needs a good wipe down. The steak and noodles look dry and not worth the money. Thai tea is my favorite but their version is pretty weak. Service is slow and when my food arrived the waitress told me my order has bell peppers in it and I specially told them I'm allergic to bell peppers and still serviced it and asked if it was okay... I told them I'm allergic to it and unless they want me to go to the hospital then NO! They try to rectify the issue by offering soup or salad and I gladly declined. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again!!!
6/12/2018,4,"This is the first Bento restaurant in Jacksonville (affectionately dubbed Bento Blue).  Located beside a Mochi yogurt shop, this local and Florida ""fast food"" chain was pretty hipster with its modern setting.  The restaurant is small compared to its big brother Bento Red which is a full size sit down restaurant located near Cinemark Tinseltown theaters.  Bento Blue makes up for its size with big service and a smooth ordering at the counter process before you self-seat at your booth or table.I am a fan of what Bento has dubbed ""Pan-Asian cuisine"" which includes good sushi, Japanese grilled fare, Japanese Udon/Ramen soups, Korean Beef Bulgogi as well as Filipino Lechon (roasted pork) -- these are my regular ""rotation"" of favorite dishes I order.  All so delicious!I've expanded my rotation of Bento Pan-Asian food and also love the sushi rolls, bowls, bento boxes, and boba teas!If you are looking for a nice place for Pan-Asian food in a small restaurant setting, you'll be happy you checked out Bento Blue!"
11/9/2016,5,This was my first time here and I am now so excited to visit the new location built in South Florida!The atmosphere was nice and casual. You order first and then take a seat amd a number. They will bring the food to you once it's ready. I ordered two different sushi rolls that were both great. The food was very fresh and the service quick.
6/6/2018,3,"This is my first visit to the Bento Cafe.  The place is always packed so I was curious to see what all the hype was about.   It's basically a fast food Asian/Sushi restaurant.  You place your order, get a number and your food is delivered to your table.  I was in the mood for a Bento Box and ordered the Chicken with Szechuan sauce.  The presentation is beautiful but unfortunately looks can be deceiving.  Lol.  Here is the breakdown of my Bento meal. Chicken in Szechuan sauce...chicken was very over cooked.   It tasted like it was reheated a million times.  The vegetables were fresh but the sauce was way too salty.  Low Mein noodles...cold, hard and lacked flavor. MehSalad with ginger dressing...very good.  Fresh green beans.  They were cold and there could have been more.  Very stingy with the portion.  I guess to each his own.  Just another typical, overrated fast food joint in SJTC.  Perhaps the sushi is better but I'd be weary.  If you can't give me fresh chicken how can I trust you'll give me fresh fish?  Just sayin!"
8/8/2018,5,"Business travel often affords me with unique and wonderful culinary experiences. It can, unfortunately, also have the opposite effect. So, happening into the Bento Café while working in Jacksonville, I anxiously awaited my made-to-order Poke Bowl. The atmosphere was pleasant and lively. The employees buzzing all around had welcome smiles. I couldn't help but smile back. Make no mistake, this is NOT fast food!  I waited for a good 25 minutes for my food and let me tell you that it was totally worth the wait. The ingredients not only looked fresh, but the taste was extraordinary. I noticed the orders being delivered to tables of awaiting customers and everyone appeared delighted with their orders. I even saw several people sharing bites of each other's food. It's definitely a little hot spot that is popular with the millennials, but if you're a Gen X, like myself, you will be delighted with selections and the prices.  Go ahead and give The Bento Café a try, and that folks, is all she wrote."
3/29/2021,1,"I ordered the surf and turf poke bowl and this is normally what i get once a month here but i was extremely disappointed from what i was given. No masago, barely any chicken and avocado. It just looks so messy and it didn't look appealing at all. :/ this isn't the bento service i usually get"
1/20/2020,4,The service was  good at the counter. Unfortunately they were out of several dishes. Chose the rice bowl with broccoli and chicken. It was good. Seemed a little light on the chicken and broccoli with lots of rice. Good for lunch.
2/23/2020,4,To go order if soup satisfied my palate but the lack.of knowledge displayed by staff and the drab look sent me to the next location next time.Feels like another fail on a town center location. I guess they feel like they don't have to be great.
8/18/2019,4,"Quick, casual, and very tasty! I have only had the sushi from Bento and am always pleased with what I get! It's a perfect choice when you want something quick that's not your typical fast dining experience. I love that you can get some of the rolls as a half order and that way you can try multiple flavor combos!"
1/28/2016,3,"Have to update my review to reflect the integrity of this business' management:Bento's management team did a thorough follow up after my last review and contacted me personally to apologize again and inform me that pest control was called and the restaurant serviced since. This shows how dedicated they are to customer satisfaction and quality. After much consideration and the fact that many of my friends love it here, I am willing to continue as a patron. I do love the concept of the Bento box and there is always something for every taste. Service has always been great and what can I say,  I'm a sucker for boba tea hahaCheers."
8/14/2019,5,Very nice place for Poke. Food was fresh and delicious.They serve kids dishes as well as beer.
2/25/2021,2,"Great food, came here twice. Ordered various meals both times and sushi both times. Food comes out quick. The sushi takes FOREVER! Like everyone was done eating and I was still waiting for my sushi. Like 30 minutes after everyone else was already finished. And that was only because we had to go back up and remind them.  Then they served my roll with no wasabi or soy. I'm sure if I asked at the counter I would have gotten it. At that point I just ate it so we could leave. It was delicious and the waitress was apologetic it came out so late. But still, when you're hangry you're hangry ya know?"
10/1/2020,2,"Spent an extra 10 minutes hungry waiting next to the pick up table. It clearly says to pick up at the table, but apparently they were too ""busy"" or couldn't deign to bring it to the table. So I stood there awkwardly wondering where my food was until I finally got annoyed and went to the counter. My food was just sitting there. I wouldn't mind walking all the way to the counter but some signage would be nice instead of looking dumb waiting for food that never comes to where it's supposed to be. And in all honesty I don't see why it's difficult to put the food where it belongs so customers can grab it."
1/9/2018,3,"Second time in row I've come in for a Boba Tea and there was no boba. Food is good, but wondering if they need some inventory mechanisms in place to not run out of a vital ingredient especially on a day when they are Buy One Get One. My review could have easily been a strong 4 stars."
8/20/2021,1,"I went in and ordered a bowl of Udon with sesame stir fry and chicken. I also ordered a cup of tao tea with lychee flavoring and boba. I've had this boba combo before at another shop and it came out smooth and just a little sweet. That boba was great but the boba here however was nothing like this. This boba was harsh, waaaay too sweet and left a rubbery taste in my mouth. After drinking this my mouth was somehow more dry than before, so I decided that it would be necessary to have  some water. I asked the server for some water and this convo ensued, (server) ""I'm sorry but our water fountain is broken so that wouldn't be possible"", (me reluctantly) ""Umm ok, so could I just get some tap water instead"", (server) ""I am truly sorry but we just can't do that, (me frustrated) ""okkkeyyy then"". After that I walked back to my table in disappointment and a dry mouth.           At this point I wanted to just leave but u had paid $30 for this meal so I was not going to waist it. Five minutes later my food arrived and actually looked pretty good but by this point I realized that they had given me lo menu instead of the Udon that I had ordered. I got over this and just started eating. It was pretty good. The chicken was cooked well and the stir fry was as well. The sauce was good and complimented the noodles. I left with a full belly but also dry rubbery mouth and a thought of passively bad service. Overall: 10Food: 6/10Service: 3/10Drink: 1/10Cost effectiveness: 3.5/10"
9/24/2017,5,"First time here and I'm in love. I have always avoided this restaurant because it seemed so crowded but when I visited for a Friday date night we got through the line in about 10 minutes and once we ordered we received our food in less than 5 minutes. The service was very fast and all of the employees were nice and helpful. I ordered a custom poké bowl (for $12) with shrimp, spicy tuna, salmon, mango, avocado, shitake mushrooms, tempura flakes and white rice. It. Was. Delicious. I love the ginger sauce with it because it is flavorful and a little bitter which helps to balance out the dish. I was surprised by how small the serving was initially but by the end of my meal I realized it was the perfect amount. My husband and I shared a Dynamite II roll and a Salmon roll that were both the best sushi we have had since moving to Jacksonville. I don't normally like fried sushi but the Dynamite II roll was undeniably good and huge (10 pieces).My husband ordered a shrimp lo mein bowl that was really flavorful. It wasn't greasy at all and the flavors were bright, instead of the dish being drowned in soy sauce. Overall, I loved this place and will definitely be back!"
7/30/2018,5,Perfect as always.  Been here dozens of times- love everything I've had (fall back is the build ur own poke bowl.)  Their sushi salmon is amazing!  Everything is always so fresh & we always get our food quickly.  They have an app for takeout too which rocks!  Place u dont mind eating at alone or with a bunch of friends.
6/4/2020,4,Yummy bento box Asian food. A lot of food for the price you pay! We had left overs. Only taking a star off because our salads were kinda blah. The leaves weren't super fresh. Everything else was super good! We will be back!
6/6/2020,1,Service was awful. My friend didn't even get her food thirty min after we already did so she canceled it. The general chicken was so horrible my other friend could eat it. MY food was a sushi bowl that was actually disgusting. WARM RAW salmon. I literally feel sick and found a random mushroom in my bowl? We were treated awful by customer service as well.
4/15/2020,3,"Ordered lunch a couple of days ago through DoorDash. Got the Bamboo and the Special Mex and it was $25.23 without service fee, delivery tip, etc. We thought the rolls were extremely overpriced considering the dozens of sushi options we have within a 3 mile radius of our apartment. To top it off, we didn't get chopsticks as we requested so we ended up spending over $30 on only two rolls of sushi that we ate with a fork lol."
5/1/2019,5,"There are over 50 restaurants at the St. John's Town Center, and I'd easily put Bento in my top three.  I've had a lot of things on their pan-Asian menu, and most of it really good.  But once I discovered the Spicy Cream Chicken, I never looked back.Sure they've got some solid sushi as well, but throw some of their tender noodles in a bowl, add a heap of that Spicy Cream Chicken (with a swirl of sriracha sauce like a spicy cherry on top), and it doesn't get much better.  The restaurant itself is a little cramped, that would be my only knock.  It's counter service too, so once you've ordered, you better hope you can find an open table to enjoy you plate of creamy deliciousness.  But unless you're there at peak lunch hours, you should be fine.The service has always been really friendly, and the food comes out pretty quick too.  I love the atmosphere and the colors as well.  Overall, when I'm looking for a quick and tasty place for lunch, it's hard to compete with Bento Cafe...although I think they dropped the ""Cafe"" part of their name for some reason."
3/7/2019,3,"Clean lines and contemporary is the vibe. I had looked at the menu before stopping by and thought I had what I wanted picked out until I was informed the don't make that sushi roll there- well, crap. So I switched to another roll. I was sent juggling the cup, table marker and my purse and headed to the free style coke drink machine. The woman in front of me had the same problem juggling everything and left her table marker behind- and guess what I did? The same exact thing- left it at the drink station and had to go back for it! The cashier was polite and sweet. Within 10 minutes I was delivered my 8 piece Mexican roll. I love sushi- but I should have went with the fried rice after I couldn't get the one roll I wanted. This roll was little shrimp and tons of cream cheese. I will have to give them another try- maybe order something hot- another entree. I will be sure to update my review when I do! They were ok- but I wanted great!"
1/13/2018,4,Quick and easy date night! Food was delicious and hot but camePut one by one so my fiancé's food cameOur way before mine. We had to ask someone if mine had gottenMissed. Quick to fix and very apologeticAnd the delicious flavors made up forIt.
9/3/2019,3,"Forrest Gump could solve a trigonometry problem faster than getting my order taken for Korean chicken at this location. I once watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the time it takes to stand in line here. Whenever I want to grow out a beard I just come to Bento for lunch and it looks good by the time I leave. Ladies don't buy hair extensions: just come here, wait in line for your order and your hair will be grown out by the time you pay. Roseanne era John Goodman could run a 40 yard dash faster than the time it takes to get an udon rice bowl order in. So yes the food is splendid for a chain restaurant but expect to wait longer than the time it takes to read Leviticus backwards."
7/27/2019,4,The orange tofu was one of the best I've had. The bento boxes are a really fun experience. The vegetable sushi was not the best but everything else was excellent. Great boba as well.
9/21/2018,1,"To begin with I just wanna say how much I used to love this place! Tonight I asked my husband to order me ""build a poke ball"" The usual price was $12 plus tax and tonight while picking up my order I can't believe they change the prices to $15 plus tax. Is this a joke? Their sushi are good but pricey, sushi house down the street has amazing sushi for a better price. I have order to go so many time from this place and some how they always screw me and my household order with some small portion that that can fill only a child up. I'm sorry after the disappointment with this place has made me not want to ever order anything from this place."
3/13/2018,1,"This location sold me FROZEN CHICKEN WINGS!!!There was no SHAME! The girl took it back and brought another batch and guess what? They were still FROZEN! Sorry not worth my time, there are too many competitors to stomach nasty dining experiences. The sushi was ok but I could never trust a kitchen that would send out frozen food. The manager never came out and apologized because no one cared. Disgusting behavior for a restaurant. If your looking for a sushi fix try somewhere else cause there is nothing worst than food poisoning, I don't trust anyone who does not care about the quality of their food."
6/13/2017,4,"Bento is a great concept that brings different styles of Asian cuisine together in one restaurant. Bento blue is located in the town center and is connected to the frozen yogurt place, mochi, next door. They offer different styles of Asian food like sushi, stir fry, fried rice, and various soups and apps. Also they serve boba drinks which are hot or miss for me in the flavor department. Some of the better dishes are the spicy cream fried chicken and the Korean stir fry entrees. This meals can be paired with rice, noodles, or put into a bento box for an assortment of sides. Even though the price is very reasonable for the portion size, I somehow always still hungry unless I order an app or sushi to go with my meal.The noodle dishes standout for me and are all delicious, but I love me some noodles so take that as it is. Once I found my go to dishes I always have a great meal. Some of the boba flavors are not that good but I just go with Thai tea when all else fails. If you are new to Asian fare, go to bento as they have the beginners guide to what to eat with different flavors from different Asian cultures. They should introduce a two entree combo so I can try more dishes on my visits."
5/8/2019,4,"I already have a favorite sushi restaurant, so this would definitely be my second go-to sushi place. Very fun hype young crowd (super loud) inside that is usually why we order and eat outside because it is very noisy- A lot of kids and UNF students. Over all the sushi is delicious and always fresh."
5/30/2019,4,Pretty darn good for lunch under $10. I had the mini Build Your Own Poke bowl. I had poke soy salmon with rice and toppings. Very good but prepare to wait- it gets really busy at lunch time!
2/4/2019,5,Nice and casual plus hours open most all day long so it fits our crazy schedule.  Not noisy either.The food was awesome and the prices were good.  Therefore: 5 stars !Will def go there often.
6/2/2015,4,"I like Bento, but what is not to like? They have Sushi. They have Thai. They have Chinese. They have Japanese. Okay, you get the idea that it is an Asian restaurant. So come ready to order, when you hit the door.It is a bit hurried, the dining room a bit crowded and loud but the food chooses are so good even the pickiest eater in your group will be pleased. My favorites include Mongolian Beef and Sushi, but so far everything's good."
5/18/2019,2,"As someone who loves Bentos and has tried many different locations across that state, this is so far the worst one. I am writing this review in hope that this will open someone's eyes to the issues they have in house and improve. First there was only one cashier when there was a long line. The reason it got so long was because two different parties wanted the cashier to explain the entire menu to their needs. I get that. I got pissed because all the other employees saw the line and made themselves look busy to avoid dealing with the line. By the time someone took the reigns and opened another cashier, he was overly too nice to the point of being super fake. I get good customer service but that was too much. Next issue is that they run out of sauces to meals. This is a common issue in some bentos especially when they first open. I dont know how long this location has been open, but Please make sure you are well stocked. Next, tables were dirty when trying to sit down. Not really noticable if you just pass the table but it is noticable when you try to put your napkins down and the table is sticky. Last, my fiance and I both had bentos fried rice, one of our favorite dishes and instantly noticed something wrong. The rice was cooked in too much water making it mushy beyond belief as well as the veggies. This needs to be watched. We couldn't eat our meals but hopefully this will help knowing for future reference."
12/29/2018,5,"Finally! I've been hearing about this place for ages and finally got the chance to try it. So. Good. I got the red curry with chicken and udon noodles and it was perfect. It had the perfect amount of spice and had just enough food for the price. For it being so busy on a Saturday, the service was quick and the food came out hot. I can't wait to try other things on the menu!"
9/8/2016,4,"My thoughts on a first visit to this establishment:- Bento boxes are neat; you can get so much stuff that it may not matter how things taste (quantity over quality, right???)- Lots of drink options--so many kinds of liquid refreshment. I went with the Taro Thai Tea and it was OK.- our sushi rolls didn't come with wasabi; we had to ask for it and more ginger- sushi rolls we ordered looked really cool but tasted just OK.The Spicy Cream Chicken is really good and as long as you don't think about the calories of this fried, saucy, creamy creation, it's great. I wish the noodles tasted fresher/better in the bento because I had to eat rice instead to make a more satisfying bite. This rating/visit was elevated by the SCC, no doubt!"
11/5/2019,3,"I get lunch here regularly, and always eat in the restaurant.  I usually order sushi rolls (raw fish) and quality is decent, service pretty quick.  I do tip the sushi chefs in cash when they do a great job - which is my usual experience, but today the quality was a little below par for this place.  The rainbow roll was falling apart on one end, not cut in evenly sized pieces, and in a couple of places not even cut all the way through.  I didn't recognize the usual crew behind the counter, so maybe there has been some turnover.  One other nit - the restaurant uses a retail system that makes you go through a process to leave a tip when you are checking out.  I see other restaurants doing the same - - - -how are you supposed to leave a tip when you haven't had any service yet?  Stupid.  But it makes you go through the process and enter zero if you aren't tipping up front."
4/3/2021,1,"I would give zero stars if I could. Went to dinner with a friend, they ordered after me and received there food 10 minutes after ordering. I however waited 20 minutes with no food. Horrible experience!"
8/21/2016,4,"Bento is a lunch staple for me. You can get an array of food... Udon noodle bowl, Korean beef, Thai curry, Japanese curry, sushi, stir fry, bento boxes! And with all of those options it's fast, consistent, and always delicious!My go to is the yellow curry chicken bow with rice or noodles, or the red chicken curry katsu. Both delicious! My friend will get the red and yellow curry and Mix it together! Ha! The options are endless! Sometimes the line can be long, and it's annoying that they charge you for extra sauce or vegetables..."
3/24/2016,4,"Bento Café is a small, but very popular sushi and Pan-Asian fusion restaurant around the perimeter of St. Johns Town Center. I liked the fact that they were open until after 10 on a weekend evening, so I was able to pop in and enjoy some tasty rolls after the sun went down.This little café had quite a line of hungry diners who shuffled inside, picked up a menu, placed their order at the counter, and then sat down while waiting for their food to be delivered. Everything on Bento's menu is cooked to order and prepared in minutes. The restaurant has a very sleek and modern look with lots of brushed aluminum and blue dragon colors.The menu is a fun mixture of traditional nigiri sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, classic sushi rolls, sashimi bowls, and sushi sampler platters. If you prefer your little fishies to be cooked before they reach your table, then you can order different types of teriyaki, stir fry, noodle bowls, curries, and noodle soups. One very popular option is the bento box which is your choice of a smaller-sized entrée with steamed white or brown rice, lo mein, ginger salad, string beans, and orange slices for just under $10.I sat at a table near the sushi bar, and waited for them to bring out my miso soup and two different rolls. The first was a Volcano Special roll, made with tempura shrimp, tuna, wakame, cream cheese topped with avocado, baked tilapia, krab, kreemchee sauce, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese with my sushi, but this roll was surprisingly good.My second roll was the TNT Roll which was a special spicy tuna mixed with masago and scallions, then layered with seared tuna, spicy mayo, and sprinkled Japanese chili peppers. Spicy and very yummy!I would describe Bento Café as an Asian fast-food place, where the food is very fresh and good, and where you'll be in and out within a short time frame. This place is worth a stop if you're in the area."
8/12/2018,3,"Stopped here to grab a quick bite of sushi with the family. We used to frequent Bento years ago and loved their spicy tuna/salmon bowl. I went for the old standby and was a tad disappointed. While the presentation is still very nice, the fish want as fresh as I had remembered. In addition, they have changed the formulation of their spicy mayo and the flavor seemed too sweet (perhaps a switch to a mayo similar in flavor to miracle whip vs hellmans as an example). My son got the spicy Szechwan chicken with lo mein noodles. It was average (not all breast meat chicken and far too much of the salty sauce. I found this trip average and more of a fast food variety of Asian/sushi."
3/8/2014,4,"I was craving me some cuisine of the ""asian persuasion"" and through some fellow yeeps, I've heard really good things about Bento Cafe, so I figured this would be an ideal lunch spot. From bento boxes, to ramen, to fresh sushi and boba teas, the choices are quite extensive, so if you're a first timer like I was, do yourself a favor and look up the menu online before you go, because while there may be a line when you get there, it moves quicker than you'd think, and nobody wants to be ""that person trying to decide"" at the register. Fried Pork Dumplings: Served piping hot with a sweet soy dipping sauce. The dumpling was perfectly crispy and stuffed with ample amounts of savory pork filling. I could have ate just these and left happy.Pork Katsu Bento Box: Fried in panko bread crumbs and served with tonkatsu sauce. Comes with white rice, ginger salad, noodles, and string beans. The noodles were rather bland, in my opinion and needed a kick...or a kickstart. The pork was justtttttttttt a smidgen on the salty side, but delish nonetheless, and even better when dipped in the sauce. I do wish I had more than one scoop of rice, though. While hesitant to try the ginger salad because more often than not, the dressing is too heavy on the ginger, I found Bento Box's version quite refreshing and tasty. Almond Joy Milk Tea Smoothie with Pearls: A fan? Ehhhhhh not so much. I think they forgot to throw the Joy part in. Alot of almond flavor, but not a hint of coconut. The pearls were abundant, but the flavor overall was not just lacking...but rather slacking.Recommend? YES. The menu online lists the prices and flavor profiles of each dish (including whether spicy or not), and you get a good sized meal for your money.  Next on the list will definitely be the ramen soup, as many patrons seemed to be enjoying this quite fondly. Till next time, See You On Yelp!"
4/17/2018,2,"We used to love Bento - when we lived in that area of Jax it was a biweekly if not weekly place to eat. After we moved, we'd even make the trip from Fleming Island for their sushi! But I've written them off. They've changed their menu far too much including a now limited sushi menu (getting rid of 2 of the 4 rolls we eat) and their food just isn't worth the price. For the first time in 8 years of eating there, I walked out without ordering. The restaurant itself looked unkept, was stifling hot, and had an unappetizing smell. We were planning on eating inside as it was 80 degrees out yet it was hotter inside than outside. And obviously, I was perturbed that half our favorites had been removed from the menu."
3/1/2016,3,"Let me first say that when it comes to asian food, I'm kinda picky. This place is asian fast food so I came in with an open mind. I can only speak for the 2 dishes we had. Beef Bulgogi Rice Bowl $7.95 - While the flavor was good, it's not what bulgogi should taste. It was oily and made the rice very oily. If it wasn't so oily it would have been a good dish.Cantonese Pork Chop Rice Bowl $7.50 - This was very good. It actually reminded me of my family and how I miss home cooked food. We came about 40 mins after they opened on a Sunday and I also wanted to get the boba tea but they were still cooking it. That sucks. I'm sorry but they should already have that made before they open. All in all, not really sure if I'll come back because there are so many other places in Jax that I can try. In other words..."
10/1/2019,2,Great in the beginning. But quality has gone down in the past year and prices up they charge for extra sauces like it guacamole. Would come here more often if the WiFi was better to study. It just seems that the more corporate they become the lower quality they become
1/1/2018,4,"Bento Cafe was the BOMB back in my high school and college days. It was and still now a good place for groups of friends. The service was really quick and the food was delicious. Although it was very busy during lunch hours, this place was definitely great for quick bite. The prices were reasonable and decent. Now that many months and years have passed, I don't find this place exciting. My craving for this place has been decreased. The food has becoming more plain and not authentic. It's not as good as usual. The quality of the food has steadily declined.Overall, this place is okay. The staff are nice and helpful. The environment is friendly. But the food isn't like ""you must try this"" feeling. The food quality isn't that great anymore."
6/24/2016,3,"This is our second time here. My husband got the bento box and I got the Szechuan  shrimp. At first everything looked great but when I tried it, all I tasted was a bunch of pepper seeds. It lacked flavor and worse of all I had to get a new one because the first bowl I had, had Hair in it!!!! But I'll do give them some points since they offer military discount and the service was fast. But idk if well come back there anytime soon.. Maybe if we're around the area. I should've just stuck to my gut and got some thing else. Oh well next time."

6/10/2019,4,"Let me begin this review off with saying Bento is one of me and my boyfriends favorite restaurants. We go AT LEAST once a month, but normally twice. We normally eat in and I enjoy any of their sushi rolls, typically the Mex Roll or the Florida Roll. My boyfriend loves their Pad Thai as well. My last experience was definitely a very frustrating one. I called an order in at 5:45pm on a Friday, expecting them to say the food would be ready in 30 minutes, they said 10-15. So I rushed there, arrived by 6:00pm, and was surprised at how slow it was for a Friday night. I paid for my food and was told all they had to do was bag it up and I would be good to go. So I was given a number and sat at a nearby table. Unfortunately I was sitting at that table starving for over 15 minutes. No employee checked on me despite my many attempts at making eye contact with the gentlemen who cashed me out. Finally, I went back to the register and asked the three employees that were standing around where my food was. The gentleman who cashed me out proceeded to check all the bags and mine just happened to be the bag that had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes, if not since the time I arrived in the restaurant. I love Bento, and I hate writing any negative reviews, but this was an extremely disappointing experience to say the least. Especially because by the time I got home, the food was completely cold."
9/1/2019,4,"It was really busy when we came here (it was a Saturday night so to be expected), but the line went surprisingly fast. All the staff is really friendly and I feel like you get a lot of food for the price. When my bowl was taking a while to come out, they even offered me another miso soup to make up for the wait time. However, typically the food comes out very quickly."
2/15/2020,4,"Cool place, but they start closing everything thing an hour and a half early. I tried to call to place an order for pick-up but they said they don't do phone orders after a certain time....it was an hour and a half before closing ? So I had to go there a place a to-go order instead and they closed down their Boba Tea option AN HOUR BEFORE THEY CLOSE.....  I get that they wanted to go home and they were tired but come on. It would makes sense if I came in 30 Minutes before closing time but I didn't.  It's a shame because they look like such a good place and the food was good to but their operation really isn't that good. I get it's probably the manager making the calls and not the employees, so that's just poor management. Also, it was a Saturday night, you should expect late orders on a Saturday. Again, cool place, but I will probably never go again. Shame.AND there was a family still inside eating their food while the employees were putting the chair on the tables and cleaning up. That's extremely rude. It was 40 minutes till closing when that happened."
2/15/2020,5,GReat experience and RJ was such a pleasure to worK with as he took our complicated order. Everyone is friendly and  professional! Definitely a wonderful experience. We had a party of 11 and everything was delicious.
8/12/2019,1,"I have been coming here for over 10 years. !The floor manager today was so rude over my six-year-old filling her drink up with Sprite instead of water and made a huge thing charged us & brought over the receipt took my card and made us pay for that sprite by God! And her attitude the whole time. Unbelie Food has gone down hill over the years and that wonderful manager insured we will NEVER be back. They lost a 10+ year customer forever. ! Worst restaurant Mgmt I've ever seen. Will be our of business soon. Update: not a word, not a comment from jade below. Nice. We will never be back ! 12 yr customer actually. Lost due to no response which shows they responded. All they want is your money and could care less about customer service!...sad  Gave them enough time"
3/13/2018,3,"I wouldn't say I have much experience with sushi, but I know that I've tried other sushi locations and would place them above Bento. They have an ideal corner location, and you can sit outside if you desire. You go inside, order first, and then sit and eat. You won't necessarily be served unless it's the waiter bringing you your food. I usually order the box because it's both satisfying and offers a lot of sushi options that's you can pick from- however, they're what you might call ""basic"".If you don't order the box, then there's a large selection of rolls to choose from, and they're all good. My friends recommend that"
1/11/2018,5,Love Bentos I have never been disappointed in my visits to Bentos. I have found a go to in the Vegetable Stir Fry Bowl with Brown Rice and Chicken but I have liked the sushi and a couple of the other entrees! Love it...
1/27/2020,2,"Had a very disappointing experience here yesterday. My husband and I went in to have pineapple fried rice and stood in line quite a while. Once our food came his was missing both the sauce and the pineapple. Mine was missing the pineapple. After flagging down one of the staff she came back in about 10 minutes with a large portion of sauce for him but no pineapple. When I mentioned that we were both lacking pineapple she said ""oh I'm sorry ma'am"" and just walked off. Brought ours home, opened a can of dole pineapple slices and made my own pineapple fried rice. Poor customer service!"
11/19/2019,5,"I love this restaurant, I go often, the noodle bowls and the sushi always have me coming back. The spicy cream chicken is amazing, and their sushi always tastes fresh."
10/14/2017,4,If you need to curb your sushi fix quickly I highly recommend Bento in St. Johns town center. I have never had a bad experience here. Quality sushi at a great price and your food is out in minutes. If you are not in the mood for sushi the hibachi steak bowl with brown rice and the pad thai bowl with noodles are my favs.
8/12/2018,5,This place is extremely good. For fast sushi it is great!!They are also extremely fast getting your order out. The staff is very friendly as well!!
1/19/2016,4,My husband and I love coming here! The food is fairly priced and it has a cool vibe going on inside. If you're shopping around the town center or are just craving asian cuisine this is the place to hit up! They have so many options to choose from. Every time I go I get the salmon tuna don. It's so much food for $8.25 and so worth it you won't be disappointed. A cool feature(well I think it's cool) if you're like me and must have lemon in your water they already have one made and it's perfectly done and refreshing! I'm pretty sure they also have a cucumber water to choose. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!
3/8/2018,3,"The quality of the sushi here was good, though they should have a 6 piece per roll option instead of 4 or 8. Their sauce options lack, we really wished they had something not spicy and a traditional shrimp sauce like you'd get at other bento and sushi places. The miso and clear soups were good as well. They have salad options if you don't want soups.Be prepared to spend more than other places because of the location. For the 4, 8 piece rolls and ""combos"" to get a soup and drink you could go to another sushi place and spend less. This was definitely giving into a pregnancy craving for me to get sushi since we were already shopping at the town center."
1/16/2016,4,"I came here before and really liked this place, but this time I ordered the Mongolian noodle. I get it and there is barely any sauce. I ask the waitress if they could kindly put more sauce on it because it was rather dry. She says that there was sauce in the vegetables. Then says I can buy more sauce for 50 cents. I say sure, but pointed out it was dry in the first place. So they bring me a receipt for $1.07. Now it is a dollar plus tax. I get the sauce and it is quite a lot. All I wanted was for the cook to add a bit more. The food is good, but this incident really turned me off and I will skip this place in the future. I hope they enjoy the dollar for the 10 cents worth of sauce and making a customer unhappy.Update:  I had to upgrade my 2 to a 4 because Bento Director contacted me and apologized.  I was offered a $10 compliment next time I am there and was sure to promise and talk to staff so this would not happen again.  I feel I should upgrade the rating because they actually care and that means a lot.  So despite my experience I still like this place and feel they create good food."
1/22/2018,1,"I was really disappointed.  I got the veggie stir fry with tofu and lo-mein noodles. The sauce was very bland and the dish itself was greasy. Not to mention there really weren't many snow peas (maybe 5-6) or carrots. There were a lot of mushrooms, which were delicious.  I took half home and reheated it with terryiki sauce, which improved it some.  Still not enough veggies and the tofu didn't really take on the flavor of the sauce like it should.  We asked about dessert and all they have is crunchy noodles with sweet and condensed milk.  So we asked for fortune cookies as dessert....we each got one.  The fortunes were really stupid too.  How cheap when we wanted more than just one. I won't be back."
1/5/2021,4,They've change the tofu and it's much better and crispy now! I'd definitely recommend it if you're vegetarian!
4/7/2015,3,"I've been in Bento several times to grab a quick bite while shopping it up at St. Johns Town Center. I've tried the bento box, their sushi and most recently their Pad Thai. For a fast casual style place they're doing it right. On my most recent visit I had the Pad Thai and shared an order of the fried dumplings with my dining date. The dumplings were A-OK. I don't know if I'd order them again, but I wouldn't pass them up if I was in a dumpling kind of mood. The pad thai hit the spot. Just the right amount of spice, a hint of sweetness and plenty of tofu to go around. It had a nice crispness on the outside which definitely upped the texture/mouth feel of the dish. Bento Cafe is not a place I go running to on a regular basis, but when we're in the area it's a nice option to keep on the rotation."
3/2/2018,5,Bento has been a usual hangout place for me and my friends since the theater is just around the corner. What I love about this place is that they have happy hour 5 through 630 pm . The food is awesome and they have live acoustic performances.
10/28/2019,2,"Sorry to give a less than good review but this time it is warranted .  Order the Bento box with Mongolian chicken.  Chicken was barely warm and had three green beans drenched in grease.  Ladies room was dirty, greasy floor and door paint peeling off.  No thanks not for me I'll never waste my money again ."
5/5/2018,5,"Yummy sushi. Good prices. Prompt service. Fun ambiance. ...and a kid's menu, a plus. I don't understand why people underrate this place. Perhaps they don't like having to order at a counter and prepay, but it's just an alternative method of streamlining their clients. The line takes time to get through during peak dinner hours like we experienced, but honestly it didn't take longer than a long line for in-n-out burger."
11/16/2019,5,"This could be one of the best places for sushi in Jacksonville, Miguel was the one who took our order and he was one of the kindest and most welcoming employees we could have asked for. The food was excellent and come out fast even though there was a line almost out the door. Overall a 5/5 experience and I will definitely be back again."
7/15/2018,4,"I was actually pretty impressed with this place. I ordered a noodle bowl and sushi roll, be careful the noodle bowl is HUGE but it was really good. I was less impressed with the sushi. It tasted really good but was rolled really loose and fell apart really easy. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
7/7/2011,4,"This is the closest I can get to ramen anywhere in Jacksonville. Another plus, they are open hella late. I was sick one day and wanted real soup, damn it!  So I came here. Their Sliced Beef Szechuan Soup is one of my faves on the menu. The broth is nice and hot and the beef is marinated in the sauce. I came one day after church on a Sunday and it was packed, with the line extending outside. If you are working and can't get out of the office, or you are just kicking it to The Lazy Song, you can get Bento delivered to you through the DoorStep Delivery service."
2/10/2016,3,"Lively modern setting where you order at the counter then take a seat for food to be delivered.  Cashier and servers all friendly and efficient.Food is served fast, nicely presented and  reasonably priced at this food chain strip mall sushi / bento spot.I had the spider roll.    A ten piece sushi roll with crispy soft shell crab, avocado, cucumbers, and krab* with eel sauce 
and masago.The sushi was well presented but the soft shell crab tasted a bit like the oil it was fried in.The Jasmine tea was hot and fragrant."
10/30/2019,3,"General Tso chick was alright. The restaurant felt dirty, but reasonably priced. Usually good sushi."
8/5/2019,2,"Typical American Japanese-ish style restaurant. As a Japanese, this is not authentic Japanese dishes. Food is not great. At least not our favorite. Poke sauce is typical Chinese soy sauce. Service is good."
11/9/2018,4,"Bento Cafe offers excellent service, food quantity, quality, and affordability. Stopped in for lunch recently and was reminded how good Bento can be. Quick order at the counter than take a number to your table to have your meal delivered to you. So many great choices and every dish can be customized based on each diners preferences. Nice fresh sushi options and plenty of hearty entrees. Pick your base such as rice or noodles, your toppings, your proteins and your sauces. If you like a nice variety, like I do, go with the Bento box. This lunch includes a ginger salad, small green bean appetizer, noodles, brown or white rice, and a main dish. I had the Pao Pao spicy cream chicken and wow, this absolutely packed a flavor rich pow! Fried breaded chunks of chicken breast dripping with this delectable flavorful sauce. I have no idea what is in it, and certain is it not on any healthy eating diet plan, but it is so delicious. Just enough spice to pack amazing flavor but not too much for the spicy heat timid like me. I upgraded my lunch to a combo with a drink and extra side, the soup, and I had way more food in front of me than I could polish off in one sitting even on my hungriest days. Overall, Bento is one of my top choices on my lunch rotation list again."
10/12/2020,1,"Bento used to be my favorite place to eat... I am so disappointed with their customer service lately. I had a 30 minute lunch break, so I wanted to call in my order ahead of time so I had plenty of time to take a break and eat. I called over 7 times, phone was disconnected or simply just were not answering. I drove to the Tinseltown location to place my order. I was in such a hurry to get there I left my debit card at work. Apparently they don't take cash because of COVID....even though the cashier was wearing gloves and a mask..... I missed my entire lunch break. This is not the first time bento has dropped the ball... When I have got food to-go in the past, something is always missing. I will not be eating here ever again. Thank goodness there is several other options in that area and people who have a busy work schedule will not miss their lunch breaks."
8/30/2020,2,Wtf is wrong with their boba drinks. The drinks are way too sweet and powdery and the boba pearls are way too hard and chewy. Get your shit together Bento
11/9/2016,4,"The first time I went to Bento Cafe was when I was a college student in Gainesville in the, let's just say 2000s. Wide-eyed, bushy-tailed at the Asian fusion concept and bento boxes, I really enjoyed the restaurant, even though it was always crowded in an already confined space. Flash forward to present-day and it appears this business is thriving in Jacksonville. Their food menu have expanded significantly as well, although they still provide bento box dinners among other Asian foods. This is a sit-down fast-food Asian fusion dining that offers primarily Japanese, Korean, and Chinese foods. This location is not to be confused with the Bento Southside location, which offers waiter service. The Southside location is, I guess you can say, a more refined version. For what it is, the food is decent and the price point/range is reasonable. It's a nice addition to the fast foods dining option at the Town Center."
12/6/2016,4,"Asian cuisine is by far my favorite of all fares. I'm usually pretty picky about things only because there is this preference for cream sauces and smothering everything in cheese, and I'm just not a fan. Which is why I love Asian fare so much; there are so many other options that all taste amazing. That being said, when I want some sushi, sashimi, or a Bento Box, Bento is usually where I go. I've only had one instance where they let me down but that was years ago and the mistake has not since been repeated. I used to get only their sushi Bento Box meal (I've had the regular Bento Box, equally delicious but sushi is my weakness!) but after discovering the goodness that was their Spicy Tuna-Salmon Don bowl, my allegiance was converted. Now each time I go guess what I get? If you guessed the bowl, you get a cookie (idk from where but treat yourself). Though I get the beets and scallions removed my favorite thing about the bowl is how fresh it is. The great thing about sushi and such is that for me, I can eat a bunch and not feel horrible afterwards. The chunks of tuna and salmon, spicy mayo, steamed rice, seaweed salad, slices of cucumber, and masago simply equates to my palatable joy. There really isn't much of anything I have against Bento's menu or the experience their. Except for the fact that I've found a new place to get my sushi bowl but Bento still has a good one. Keep up the good work."
8/29/2018,1,"Extremely disappointed. I have been coming to Bento for more than 5 years. I have always loved it but everyone who has been coming for that long knows the standards and the quality of the restaurant have only went down. I had a sushi combo box and asked for the Rainbow. I got served a fish that was not fresh at all. After I finished i left the sushi that just didn't look right and passed on my opinion to one of the males employees. I said that white tuna shouldn't look brown on the edges and he said they didn't sell white tuna, but rather escolar. I did not mind this but no where in the menu it said escolar. Regardless it shouldn't look that bad. At least tell the chefs to cut the edges that don't look good so that a person would actually want to eat it. Very bad presentation."
5/8/2021,1,"they ""couldnt"" help me make the order the way i wanted it so i dont even know if i will like it , food took very long , friends order came before mine , an then order was wrong !! first time coming and will not come back ."
6/7/2018,5,"Love this place! Food is great and the amount you get for the price is amazing! Always a great experience, it's helped me like sushi, never been a fan before going here. So good."
8/9/2017,5,"I love Bento, I really enjoy the flexibility of being able to customize my rolls with healthier options like brown rice or lettuce rolls. I like building my own rolls. I like being able to substitute soy or rice wrappers on any roll. The online ordering makes everything super easy and fast. They have a great variety of rolls to choose from, the fruit rolls are some of my favorites because I like to pretend I'm being healthy. I also like that they have a wide variety of menu options...my boyfriend doesn't eat sushi and so I rarely get to have it, but we can both come to bento and find things we like."
2/24/2019,1,Horribly slow service! Not even busy called ahead and still had to wait forever for them to finish completing my order. Thankfully one lady worker noticed my order was not being fulfill yet as i stood there and took initiative! But i should have never have had to wait that long when i called way in advance  Did i mentioned the place was not even busy at the time...
6/29/2014,3,"Bento's food isn't bad, it's actually pretty decent for a cheaper version of sushi/pan Asian cuisine.  The only problem is that they charge pretty much the same amount of $$ as a good sushi place for sushi that most would say is a few steps above grocery store sushi!!  You'll find that this is case with the rest of the menu as well, although everything might taste ok it isn't worth the price per item, and unfortunately everything is priced individually besides the bento boxes which come with there basic side items.I do like the fact that they have the coca-cola freestyle machines here, and if you want some fro-yo after your meal Mochi is right next door at this location.  You no longer have to walk out of Bento and walk the 25 or so feet to walk into Mochi's door anymore as they now have a hall way that connects the two together."
8/18/2019,1,"Terrible experience and food. When we arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday night, they we already out of  any entree with fried chicken. They were out of green beans and broccoli which my bento box should have come with. The soda machine was out and my husband had to wait 15 minutes for his drink. When I got my boba, the boba was hard. All the food was super bland including my side of Ramen which took 30 minutes to get to me. By that time I was already done with the rest of my meal. Don't eat here!"
12/15/2016,3,"I love Bento however it can be a hit or miss and the food consistency. The food is always fresh. The lines can be long but it moves very quickly. It can get busy and loud in the dining room. Average sushi, the bento boxes are good, the Tuna Don (sushi bowl)is awesome!"
7/9/2016,3,"A friend from New York came down for my wedding and as we were in town center shopping, we decided since the husbands don't like sushi we would come together to Bento to get our sushi fix. We ordered at the register after perusing the menu and decided on the lunch special. We picked a few rolls and sat down. A waitress brought us our plates which were neatly prepared after a few minutes. Honestly, the sushi was delicious but it tasted like the rolls I buy from Publix. Nothing super spectacular. It's nice to sit down somewhere very contemporary and modern to eat your sushi and sip Boba tea with friends, but again nothing extraordinary. Overall, I enjoy Bento and it's great for a quick bite of sushi to get a fix. The lunch special is a great deal and freshly made and the service was lovely. I would come here again when I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way if I wanted sushi."
7/27/2019,2,"Very unorganized and unsanitary for a restaurant that has been around for a few years. The bathroom to put it ""nicely"" was disgusting. I've had decent meals here 3 or 4 times but last one prior to today was very mediocre. Not going back after today."
7/1/2017,4,"This place looks really nondescript so I was surprised when someone suggested it to me. It gets crowded, like line out the door. There are no servers at this location; you order and seat yourself and someone brings out your food. The line moved pretty quickly. I got the yellow curry (coconut milk based) which is one of my favorites and something my Asian mom always cooked when I was growing up. It really tasted like her cooking! I was very impressed and look forward to trying more dishes. I guess I will try their other location in Southside because I would prefer a bar (this location only had beer)."
7/17/2014,4,"I like coming to Bento every time I'm back in Jacksonville because it's good quality asian food, not over priced and it's filing. Bento has really fast service and it's definitely a nice place to go and have lunch with a friend or a quick and affordable dinner with family. What's unique about bento is the menu and ordering style. You stand in line to order your food kinda like a fast food joint. You are given a number that you place at your table and they bring the food to you. You can tip of you like but it's not sit down service which is pretty cool because it's good eats on a budget. You can also eat outside which is also a great opinion for when the weather is beautiful. Everything on the menu exception the sushi portion of the menu can be ordered either in a plate, bowl, or bento box option. And the item you order can be made with your choice of beef, chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Each choice of beef, chicken etc is set at a price and each plating comes with different things. For example the plate comes with rice, the bowl is cooked noodle style, and bento box has a smaller serving of rice than the plate but comes with small ginger salad.  So the price of your meal really depends on your choice of meat. I got the garlic mushroom chicken bowl. I enjoy noodles very much so I always go with bowl style cooking. I've tried the garlic mushroom chicken as a plate option so it's presented with rice. But I like the noodles way better. I'm only giving bento 4 stars because the menus were sticky and the table was really sticky. So bento just needs to cleanup the location a little bit and it's a 5star location"
1/5/2017,1,"Very disappointed with the customer service! Food is great but I tried to buy my 1 year old baby rice from the kids menu and the lady in the cashier told me she couldn't because it was for ""12 and under""! (I was buying myself a bowl PLUS the kids menu) I explained  her that I wanted for him that he was under 12 and she said ""no, is for 12 and under"" like if she couldn't understand english or couldn't see my son in the table! I loved this place but after this treatment like if I was asking something for free I am not coming back again!"
4/21/2015,4,"I love to come here at least once a week. I have to try not to go for lunch sometimes because I go to much (I know it doesn't show in the check-ins but I should be the Dutchess ;)) I really love sushi just check my bio lol it is a smaller establishment but they are pretty quick on bringing out your meal. It is an order first then sit and eat set up. be aware there are two menus: one for sushi and one for bento boxes/ rice/noodle bowls. There are so many option to choose from. I sometimes just go to my favorites because it's easier than finding something new. From 3-6 during the week they have a Buy 2 great 1 free roll special. Highly reccomend. Their different rolls are delicious.If you are going to go for stir fry, I think the bento box gives you the most bang for your buck. That goes for sushi too. watchout during peek lunch times, it does get busy."
3/25/2020,3,This place can be hit or miss it used to be really really good but they either changed their recipes or the quality of the ingredients cause the only thing I get from them now is the poke bowl.the shrimp are like boiled so bland and rubbery. The tofu has an off flavor which must be from how they cook it of the seasoning they add. The sushi rolls aren't the same. The red curry which used to be my favorite is now too spicy. So I have to be in the mood to come here which is sad cause everything I tried used to be good.
5/23/2016,3,"The food is good and the service is ok. You order at the counter get a number and then they bring it to you. Sushi, stir fry, Chinese dishes. Beer and wine is available. The couple of times I've been here it's been busy. I'll be back I'm sure."
5/8/2014,3,"I absolutely love the atmosphere here. Not so much the restrooms or the crowded awkward moment of walking through the tables to get to an empty one. Staff is sort of friendly. Food I like it a lot I wish it would come out kind of warm at least, it's always room temp and a bit cooler. I like my food hot and fresh if you know what I mean. Boba, I don't like it here at all. The drinks they make itself isn't rich or flavored as it supposed to be. It's either watery or lacking the flavor of the drink. Boba balls itself I'm surprised they got that correct but each time I came here I would give them another chance to change my mind but none of the drinks are.. How they should be. Over all I don't mind coming here from time to time but I'm not really in love with the place as others are."
12/23/2017,4,It's my first time trying this place and it won't be the last! The food is amazing and fresh
12/27/2016,3,"3 stars because I enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but the boba milk tea could have been MUCH better.I got the chicken garlic soy udon noodles. This was my first time trying udon noodles and I was suprised that I really enjoyed the overall taste and thickness (compared to lo mein). I could taste the garlic, but it wasn't overwhelming. And there was no need for extra soy because the amount the noodles were cooked in was just right - didn't make me extra thirsty (sodium struggles)!However, if I'm being really honest, what I really came for was to try the boba milk tea. I was introduced to milk tea about a year ago in Gainesville, FL (UF student). I enjoy trying boba in different places and cities (especially) when I have the opportunity. I was extra excited because Bento (at least this location) has bogo milk tea on tuesdays with valid college ID. I got mango milk tea with tapioca pearls and I enjoyed the taste...at first. Then the powder settled and I kept sipping up lots of powder - it coated my throat it was so much! My only positive about the milk tea is the tapioca pearls - they weren't too hard, but nice and squishy. If the milk tea was made with milk instead of powder it would be amazing.Basically, food was delicious, milk tea not as much. The atmosphere and workers were pleasant. The line is long, but moves fast, with the tables cleared fast as well because the workers move people in and out fast. Also, if you love the Coca-Cola drinks, there's a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine so you have plenty of drink options!"
12/27/2014,3,"How do you run out of Pad Thai?   Otherwise, our meal was good.  Great variety of dishes.  This is a small restaurant.   Very tight."
8/18/2016,5,"Went around 7:15pm, it was pretty busy but not too bad. We couldn't get a menu as soon as we walked in but a worker saw that we didn't have one and helped us out immediately. I ordered the Tuna Poke Don and the Sushi Combo box and it was pretty great. Could have used more spicy mayo though for the Poke Don. (Got some extra on the side)"
5/28/2016,5,"A fun place to eat for young and old alike. You can choose from a variety of options and have a bento box option that cute. I could see it as a perfect hangout place for people who want to savor a quick Asian bite in a very contemporary yet informal atmosphere, coupled with a wide selection of boba teas... U surely can. Have them without the boba. Also not to mention the small inside store passage to the next door store - Mochi ice cream and yogurt store... Cannot leave that!"
7/7/2018,5,Ate Bentos for dinner and their Steak Lo Mein is absolutely delicious!! Will be back!!
1/8/2018,4,"This is practically my go to sushi restaurant. I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed in my life. Service is quick and great, food comes out nice and ready, and the atmosphere of this place makes a great hang out spot. I wish this place had some sort of expansion. My only complaint is that there's not enough booths or tables for everyone to dine in. I really can't deny why this place would have so much business, IT'S FANTASTIC! An expansion would just top off this place!"
5/23/2018,3,I don't recommend getting sushi there. It's quite sweet and tasted a bit artificial. Felt like it cater to the younger crowd. My husband got the steak bento box. He said it was average
7/5/2019,1,I am still waiting for my meal at 2:07 PM after paying 20 minutes ago. People have come in and eaten after me. Not impressed. My meal was $13 and I still have not gotten it. I'm pissed.
5/2/2016,5,"Love this place! In the cold months (ok, for real,  weeks...we live in Florida) my Go To is their Laksa. OMG! So fantastic! I would probably even have if it were 100 degrees out but they don't have it. And then my other Go To is their Spicy Salmon Don. Either way, don't forget their boba teas! They probably have my favorite in town, not too soft but not overly chewy either. I always get the Green Tea without flavor but they carry a good selection of options and other milk teas. This is a must if you like Asian food or if you're looking to try!"
5/6/2016,5,"My family loves this place. It's not your traditional Japanese menu. I would categorize it as fusion, but it's all good. Haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like. My usual order is Pork Curry Katsu served in a large bowl over white rice. Great wait staff too. The location in St. Johns Town Center is connected directly to Mochi Frozen Yogurt, which is a nice stop for dessert afterwards."
9/27/2018,5,"My family's favorite place to visit for sushi and Asian food on the go. Orders are prepared fast and fully customizable, love the poke bowls. Open late which is also great. Friendly customer service. Delivery is very fast too"
12/30/2016,4,"We went for Trivia night. First tie trivia night for me and first time to Bento. Their food was scrumptious. The fact that they bring out a bowl of edamame before you even have to ask is for me a reason to squeal in delight.Food was fairly priced and tasted good,our waitress was on point, and patient with our table that I am sure must have appeared like it was never going to figure out what they wanted to order. I enjoyed sampling some of their sushi and red curry. I personally feel the curry could have had a little more flavor. It seemed a bit bland but still enjoyable. I will definitively give them another go.The trivia Guy was a little hard to hear, but he made it a point to stop at the participating tables and repeat the questions. Kudos to him for rocking it."
6/20/2018,4,Made a quick stop for a meatless lunch. I opted for the bento fried rice with veggies and eggs and it did not disappoint. The rice arrive steaming with freshness and all I added was a little soy sauce and it really did not need it. The rice was delicious and the veggies were crispy but cooked. The only thing is the ac duct is exposed and the dust needs to be cleaned off. There is a chance that it could fall in to ones food other that that it was great
3/15/2018,4,"Quick service sushi at its best. Grab a menu and choose from create your own rice or noodle bowls, bento boxes and a variety of other items or flip it over and order some delicious sushi. Our family faves are the Florida roll and the Volcano special.  They also have a variety of boba teas and kid meals. Service is generally good."
10/17/2018,4,"Thanks to the Yelp Library event, I had a coupon for a free meal upgrade to use at Bento Cafe. It has been a while since I've been here, but the food and the location are the same since the last time I remember it. The only difference is that they are now connected with Mochi next door. I came in after work right before the dinner crowd, so there were not a lot of people here. The menu is simply laid out, with all the choices you could pick. I decided to try the Monogolian brown rice bowl with shrimp, along with a side of edamame. I was able to place my order quickly and sit down at the sushi bar while I waited for my meal to go. It took a little bit of waiting, but as soon as the food hit the counter between the kitchen and the dining room, they quickly put the food in the bag and gave it to me with a smile! When I opened my bag later for dinner, I was amazed to find that the edamame was still warm and buttery, and the rice bowl was warm as well. It had plenty of flavor and big pieces of shrimp in it. I was almost full by the time I finished the bowl! Everything was delicious, so I will be back soon with my other coupon, a free spring roll with purchase of entree."
8/14/2016,5,"We just love Bentos. The quality is boss. The price is low. Consistent service and food. My most unusual requests have been accommodated. The sake is really tasty. Noodle bowls: huge and delicious! Sauces are amazingSushi: the taste is on point. Portions are large. So so fresh, every time. Salads: giant and full of ingredients, not just lettuce and dressing. You'll get so much more than you expect!We've been at least 15 times so far but we'd live here if we could."
4/16/2016,2,"Sushi from the grocery store, with a pricier tag.  Not impressed, service slow, soup was salty, and sushi felt like it was sitting under a heater.Do not recommend unless feeding kids after a baseball game because the fast food feel was the only consistency."
10/8/2014,5,"This place was pretty neat. Its like a teenage hang out at sushi place. There were a lot of young hipsters. They play regular pop modern music. You ordered at the front and get a number , wait at the table for the food. The ordering system at the front was a little hectic because there are so much to choose from and feel like I'm being rush to order so I don't hold up the line. I had spicy tuna don . it was pretty yummy and fresh. I can't wait to go back and order more. But next time o really need to study the menu before I order. This will probably be my new faverate place for awhile. The servers were very young and not too attentive. But I don't have a problem with them. They are just kids. I think they have beer and wine but I'm not sure. I was too hungry to even think about"
1/13/2016,2,Went here recently with my daughter while we were shopping for some lunch. It was nicely decorated inside and clean. I was under the assumption that this was a more sit down type of restaurant but it seemed a little more fast paced and the quality was less than desired. The green tea was sweet...very sweet and in a plastic cup. The usual sushi place we go to we could have had quit a bit more for the price paid here. The sushi on my plate and 2 teas $30 a bit over priced for what you get. Not sure if I would give this place another go.
7/15/2016,3,"Bento isn't terrible it's just not something I'd drive out of my way for. Pretty average. I think Pei Wei's food is better.Pros:- Decent pricing- Good portion sizes- Udon noodles are good- Can order online- Good for groups- Lots of food options and ways to customize your food- Served fairly quickly- Service is good even though most of it is self-serviceCons:- Food is bland- Line can take forever to get through when placing an order.- No lids for drinks. Have to ask one of the servers to get a ""seal lid"" on your drink.- Inside is small and can make for a tough time to find a seat if packed."
10/16/2019,1,Ordered pad thai to go from here. There was black hair all in it. So gross! I have brown hair so it wasn't mine. Multiple pieces of black hair. I ordered pad thai not a bowl of hair. Waste of money since I couldn't eat it. Not going back. Use caution when eating here.
3/17/2019,4,"I absolutely love bentos! I love their boba tea, and I usually get their shrimp fried rice, and for the most part they get it right.. although sometimes the egg in the fried rice is burnt so the fried rice doesn't taste that great. But overall the people are super nice and the food is always fast no matter how busy they are."
12/17/2018,4,"My favorite spot for sushi or Chinese. I always try other Chinese or sushi places but they never compare. The spicy cream chicken is phenomenal and the sushi is always very fresh, tasty, and creative. Pretty cheap spot, you walk up and order at the counter then they bring to your table. Nice, clean place. I'm a regular here."
6/25/2016,5,"Undoubtedly, one of my favorite sushi places! The food is always fresh, always amazing, always quick to receive it. I've been plenty of times for lunch and dinner and it's definitely worth every dollar. The bento boxes are more than enough food and decently priced appetizers! Definitely an amazing place for a foodie!"
7/31/2016,4,"Fast casual dining style sushi & other Asian foods. Pretty good. I like the fast casual style & prices are fairly reasonable. This is our fall back place when we can't think of anywhere else to go. Service speed is ok but they don't bring all your food out at the same time, which is mildly annoying. Overall not bad but not great."
12/23/2013,3,"While the food is decent - very similar to a Pei Wei, Zen or Fire Bowl, it wasn't good enough to bring me back. The Szechwan was lacking the Szechwan flavors I love. The sushi was fresh and well prepared but didn't have much flavor. The ginger slices had no taste. The wasabi was almost appalling. The spicy eel sauce? Not spicy at all. I am almost convinced that no one makes it like I am used to eating it in Texas. Sad times for sure. Yet, the Szechwan search will continue. While I enjoyed the meal enough, what really ruined it was ordering sushi to go and waiting 30 minutes for it. It was not busy. All of the customers before us had left already. They asked me a few times if I was waiting for something, to which I smiled and repeated my order. Internally though, you know something has gone terribly wrong when the servers are asking you what you ordered. I was given a huge apologetic smile and two extra spicy eel sauces (.50 a piece) for my long wait. I would have preferred to just get a fortune cookie."
5/7/2018,5,So much fun. And yummy! Had a poke bowl with salmon and tuna. OMG so good! Service was fast and friendly.
10/26/2017,4,"This is one of my favorite fast food sushi spots.  They have the best dynamite roll.  The Lo Mein with the fried tofu is a good noodle fix, but a little heavy on the oil.  It is a small joint, but there is outdoor seating which is nice on a crisp day.  They offer at least one Gluten-Free meal, and they will try to create a gluten free roll for you."
12/3/2018,2,"Ordered a poke bowl with ""mixed greens"". Got a poke bowl with iceberg lettuce (the kind that comes in a bag with carrots). Bit overpriced for a bowl of mostly iceberg. If they had just given me a heads up, I would've changed my order."
2/20/2020,1,They forgot to put in my order once I placed it 30 minutes ago online. Horrible customer service as they admitted that it was there mistake. Rather go somewhere else!
5/14/2016,4,I had a California roll - it was really good. The Malibu milk tea was good also. My Daughter found a piece of plastic in her Spicy Udon soup. The Manager was super cool about it and handled the situation quickly and professionally. Will we be back? Heck yeah - you could tell that my Daughter's soup was the exception and my excellent sushi was the norm.
2/11/2019,3,"My family and I have been Bento fan/regulars since they opened the one at the Town Center. We were truly elated when they opened the second one at Tinseltown. Every time we go, it's always quite a treat for everything is consistently great. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is always cool, cleanliness never fails and of course, the food is to die for. Taste wise, presentation and portions never disappoint.Unfortunately and I can't believe that I'm actually sad about this.. we will probably  stop going there. YOU GUYS STOPPED SERVING SPIDER ROLLS! Spider roll in Japanese Restaurants is a must! I know people and friends who used to (back in the 90''s) not patronize Japanese cuisine because it's something foreign and different. But once they tasted spider roll, it opened their minds and got hooked.I just would like to thank Bento for all the years we enjoyed dining there. Our kids grew up learning to appreciate the different dishes. But without the spider roll, it's just not the same for me anymore.Goo"
8/24/2018,3,"The food here isn't anything spectacular, but I crave their spicy salmon don every now and then. So easy to call in my order and have a fast pick up time. The service here is pretty solid."
5/1/2016,5,Fantastic Asian style super fresh salad. Sauce is spicy but can be served aside. Highly recommend. Staff is friendly. Access to free lemon water. Great place.
9/19/2018,5,The sushi here is divine. Every time I have $3.25-$ 11.50 to spend after bills are paid this place is my first stop‼ their prices are decent and the food is delicious ‼‼‼ Staff are friendly as well
11/4/2018,4,Visited this place last night and absolutely loved the food. We ordered their signature fried rice bowl and pad thai which was level 3 spicy. Also ordered salmon spicy classic roll on the side and I wish I had some space for more food.Their service was pretty fast and staff was very friendly. We loved this place and will definitely visit again to try other things on their menu.
10/31/2019,4,Food is good but sometimes the wait time is unacceptable. I've been there maybe like 5 times with my husband and either his food takes forever to come out or he's done with his food by the time my dish comes out. This kinda kills the vibe. BUT the poke bowls are fresh and tasty and have never disappointed!
7/5/2019,2,"Location: Town center. This was our family favorite sushi place but the quality of both the service and food is deteriorating. Today the sushi for 2 people came out in one plate and no separate plates, no cookies for the kids, no ginger and no wasabi until we asked. No napkins; really!!!I have to ask for napkins, ginger and wasabi? This place needs a better manager."
6/17/2015,5,"This is our go-to place when we're at the towncenter. Awesome prices and awesome food. Sushi is on point and the bento boxes are delightful. Bulgogi Chicken is always tasty and it can be ordered to your preferred spice level. If you feel like indulging try the Spicy Cream Chicken or Shrimp! I'm a little disappointed they stopped the Boba Tea reward cards (after 8 punches you get the next one free) however if you still have any they will honor them. Regardless, that's not going to keep us away. We're addicted!It is a smaller establishment and seating is limited. It's a first-come, first-served concept. Therefore, if you have a large party I'd recommend going to their sister restaurant Bento Red on southside. Larger scale with the same great atomsphere."
7/28/2018,4,"Sushi rolls are amazing! This is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Jacksonville.  They have a large variety for sushi lovers and picky kids.  The only negative is its popularity makes for the line to go out the door.  Never the less, it didn't take long to reach the cashier."
1/29/2016,3,"Good variety of menu choices. Atmosphere screams fast food. Service is spotty as we have visited several times in 60 days. Four ppl in our most recent visit, the food was brought to our table 4 separate times! We wanted to eat together! Each dish came 10-12 mins apart! Really?"
8/1/2017,5,"We originally went to Bento Red (Tinseltown), but due to the 30 minute wait we made our way to Bento Blue (town center). This location is very small compared to the Tinseltown location, but it's still just as good. This location is a walk up and order, and grab a number location which is different from the other location. We walked up and ordered an orange chicken bowl, a dynamite roll, Philadelphia roll, and rainbow roll. We got our number, and made our drinks and looked for a seat. We found a booth and our food was out in a matter of minutes. The orange chicken is so good, I swear it never disappoints. It's always hot, and the chicken is always perfect. Our sushi rolls were also no disappointment. I am a sucker for sushi, so wherever I can find good sushi will always be a favorite for me. I have never had a bad experience with Bento, but I have never actually tried one of their Bento boxes. I guess I'll have to plan a day to go back so I can do that. Sushi date anyone?"
5/11/2017,4,"Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Only issue I ever had here was I ordered the edamame and it came with sugar instead of salt. So I went to the counter to let them know and someone at the register told me ""that's how it comes"". I've ordered it MANY times here and it's NEVER come with sugar............. but okay."
12/8/2019,5,"Attended a special event at the Tinseltown location on their back patio this week. The food was delicious and the service was extremely accommodating. If you want to plan a special event, I highly recommend using this location. The manager, Kevin Hardee, did an outstanding job to work with our group. From previous times, I know that their dumplings, Bento Boxes, and other menu items are yummy! BTW - their Thursday Trivia night is a blast! A good to location for friends and family!"
8/26/2017,5,"The staff kept things moving, the food is delivered promptly, and the quality and flavor is outstanding!!!   Our family loved it.  We will be back!"
4/3/2016,5,"This place is very good. They have a huge selection of sushi rolls, bento boxes, bubble teas, salads (with fish on them of course) etc. It is very casual, just order your food at the register, go find a seat and they will deliver it to you. I am particularly fond of the salmon don bowl. It's raw salmon, avocado, pickled seaweed, and cucumber slices on top of rice with a semi spicy sauce on top of it all. Yum!! It can get very busy here, especially at weekend lunch time. I find the best time to go is after the lunch rush. Very kid friendly, too."
10/22/2017,3,This restaurant is very cute. I love the staff and everything is always clean and the food always tastes fresh.  I haven't tried to sushi but I have tried a few different items and nothing ever tastes like it's suppose to. I ordered Green Curry recently and it taste like spicy hibachi.  I'll probably go back because it has the best boba in town but I am about to give up on the food.
11/10/2019,1,"Food came out late and at seperate times. Mine was cold. Asked to be heated or remade. No apology. Another 20 mins go by. Asked waitress how long, was ignored the first time. 2nd time I asked was told I dont know. I said can you check, no response. Asked for manager and got refund for my food only. Worst bento ever. The orlando locatoons were good. Not this one. No better than a fast food place with high priced food."
3/8/2018,4,"This was literally the best General Tso chicken ive ever had in my life. I went here on a friday for lunch and the place was packed. I knew the food was going to be good when I saw that. The prices are fair, especially for a restaurant at the Town Center."
11/10/2017,1,This is my first time here and this is not a very good experience. The line is really long and the cashier keep talking to their friends took like 10 to 15 for them to finish..... plz do something about it
5/13/2015,3,"Not bad, I was surprised how many sushi options there are in the area, but would consider this place in the future. More of a casual place than I was expecting; you order at the cashier and then leave your number on display for them to bring it out to you, so not full waiter service. They do have some outdoor seating which is nice, and are also connected to the yogurt place next door, so makes for a nice one stop shop. Sushi didn't blow me away, but wasn't expecting the world and they had a couple beers you could buy in a bottle, which was a nice option. They also had a small sushi bar, so was a strange mix of formal and not formal."
8/15/2019,1,This restaurant is filthy! I go here often and it looks worse every time. The food is pretty good but I wonder how clean the kitchen is since the rest of the place is absolutely disgusting. Sorry Bento I can't return to your dirty establishment anymore.. which breaks my heart since I loved this food.
8/8/2018,5,"I visit Bento Blue at the Towncenter at least once a week, often more. I have nothing bad to say about this wonderful place. The staff have made an effort to recognize me as I come in and are always kind and helpful. The create a poke bowl and build your own veggie roll are my two favorites. With the spicy cream chicken right behind! The prices are reasonable and the food always tastes fresh. Definitely try their spicy mayo sauce as it is one of my favorites I've had."
2/24/2013,3,"Not impressed by the food at all. It's not bad at all but I don't think I'll  likely say ""lets go to Bentos"" again. It does taste fresh and well seasoned tho. I was excited to go to this place based on the user photos,fell a bit short of my lofty expectations. It is forgettable. I didn't have sushi maybe I'll try that next."
1/23/2015,5,Bento has become my favorite new dinner spot. The prices aren't too sour and the food is very different from the other Asian restaurants in Jacksonville. The atmosphere of Bento Red and Blue is so contemporary and vibrant that I instantly feel cool upon walking in. Bento Blue is attached to the Mochi frozen yogurt bar which is very convenient if you're looking for a quick dessert after. Every time I go to bento I get either their Una Don or their Spicy Tuna Don which can be found on their raw menu. Definitely explore the menu though! There is no wrong choice!
1/25/2017,5,"Love. The place.   Great place before movie, Friday better go early.  Line is long on movie night"
1/24/2018,1,"Just order two soups for me and my wife after paid and waited for 10-15 minutes I was inform that the broth run out so they can't make what I ordered, I just upset because they should not make people wait and then just say sorry. Very disappointed of this location this is the second time this happen to us."
11/14/2014,4,"I've only been a few times but I really enjoyed it...the food is really great and the presentation is fantastic.The place is usually busy so sometimes you might have to wait in line to order at the register but usually it's not too bad...they have really delicious sushi rolls,rice bowls, appetizers and boba tea. I will say I find it unusual that they charge you 50 cents extra for a little thing of shrimp sauce...and also the last time I went they actually charged me wrong and I had to get a credit but everything worked out just fine and I will be back again!"
4/17/2017,4,Everything was delicious- the only downside is getting into Bento! They are so busy! I go as often as possible and every time I am at town center
5/23/2010,4,"I remember my boss asking me one morning, excitedly, if I had heard about Bento opening up at the Town Center. I smiled and nodded my head yes. And then proceeded to research what this Bento place was that she referred to. [You must understand pretending to know about everything your boss mentions, to your boss, even if you don't... right?]Well, found out it was a sushi joint and, me loving sushi, I immediately went to check the place out. Was I ever pleased. Bento is awesome!I love that they offer Noodle Bowls. Do you know how long I have been waiting for Jax to open a place that serves Noodle Bowls? Probably not, but it has been a while. While the Noodle Bowls are great [Shrimp Udon Noodle Soup Bowl is top choice!], they offer a lot of other great menu items to choose from. The Bento Boxes are very popular and include your choice of meat and preparation that is served with noodles, rice, ginger salad and Asian green beans. And lets not forget the Sushi. The sushi is ah-may-zing. It's really really good. I am salivating just thinking about it. Every day they have a special roll that they prepare and I suggest taking them up on it. MMMM. If you are at the Town Center doing some shopping this is a great place to hit up for lunch or dinner. Or, if you just want some good Pan Asian cuisine, its worth the trip even without the shopping!Team Bento!"
4/3/2018,5,"This is a definitely a go-to! It's tasty, quick, inexpensive and super clean. Try to go early because it gets crazy busy at lunch!"
11/4/2017,5,"Simply my favorite Sushi bar in Jacksonville. Good service, great food, affordable prices. Everything that students can dream of."
5/27/2019,1,"Poor service. Our family went to this Bento to eat at past 2 pm. Some empty tables. We ordered bento box, udon noodle soup, and chicken curry. Seated right away. Then food came. No soup spoon was given to us. When we asked for soup spoon , waitress said they ran out of soup spoon ; and no apologies. No plans of solving my issue. She just left our table. I went to the counter to speak to someone who looks like directing flow of food and got same  answer ""sorry we ran out of soup spoons"".  Really? How am I supposed to eat my lunch???? Then I was given a plastic small teaspoon to eat my soup. What a joke. To think the restaurant was not even full . Won't be back."
3/27/2015,4,"Tonight I came for sushi, simply because I'm in the mood for it tonight. I got a sushi combo box with the Tokyo Rose Roll and the Spicy Hotate Roll. My sister accompanied me and ordered Tofu Pad Thai. Which she said was ""pretty good"". My sushi was well prepared and the environment is nice. Personally I think that Sushi Combo Boxes are a better deal than a sushi buffet. You may pay the same but ultimately you get enough sushi that actually tastes like something. I really enjoyed my meal and night. Mochi is next door for quick and delicious dessert. Overall, this is a wonderful venue with delicious food and a great atmosphere. 4 stars"
8/16/2017,4,"This location is small compared to Bento Red which is down the street, so if it's busy seats will be limited. Other than that the food is good, they have plenty of dishes available. Majority of dishes can be modified so that they fit a vegan / vegetarian diet. I was nervous to try the tofu because it's usually a hit or miss but it was fantastic !"
5/30/2015,4,One of our go-to quick dinner spots. The sushi is always excellent. Their fried rice is one of my usual dishes. I tried their lo mein last night and it was so salty that I didn't even finish it. Always had a great meal besides last night. Usually packed. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Friendly staff that keeps the place clean.The Mexican roll is amazing & worth ordering!
7/17/2015,4,"We really enjoyed this place. The fish tasted fresh and they give you a decent portion size considering the price is probably some of the cheapest sushi Iv experienced. We tried the yellow curry in the bento box and was good. Love that they have brown rice options. Also their sushi rice is good and to me that's what makes great sushi. If there was a bento by our home we would visit regularly. It does feel pretty ""chain"" restaurantish, because it is. The service was very nice and helped me choose which roll to get. Love that it was attached to Mochi for dessert!"
2/6/2015,4,"All the sushi is VERY FRESH.Smoked Salmon was beyond fresh/delicious. Lunch time is very loud and busy, but they do keep it pretty quick.So much so the presentation suffers a tad because its messy.Also pretty pricey for a fast casual dining place."
3/13/2018,5,"Kind staff + great food = good time for my friends & I! It's cafe style so we don't get all of our food together but anything that took too long, staff gave us a complimentary soup. My friend got clear and she said it was ""poppin'"". Will definitely be back"
8/27/2017,1,"This is the worst Asian food I have tried since I got in US. The curry bowl only has zucchini and carrot as veggie. The beef noodle soup tastes like the water left in the pot after cleaning. A bulgogi bowl doesn't taste like bulgogi, but have some sour taste. After we tried our food, I start to wonder why this place is packed......but most of other people ordered sushi, so I guess the sushi might not be like this..... Bento in GAINESVILLE is way more better."
4/13/2015,4,I like the quality but I don't like how they nickel and dime you on extras. I like the spicy tuna don and the special Mexican is amazing.
7/4/2010,4,A buddy of mine has traveled through out the country and insisted we go here for sushi.  He seems to think it is the freshest in town. I tried to debate with him on all the great sushi places in town and he wouldn't budge.  I have been converted now too!I got the Tuna Nigiri.  Two pieces of good size for $4.  To top it off I then ordered the Dynamite Roll (?).  The Salmon was still raw on the inside and the outside was fried just enough for crunch.  Perfection on a plate!  It was $9 and had 8 pieces instead of the normal six.  The decor is definitely Asian Modern with Blue and Black decor and stainless steel.  Makes you feel hip and with it even while wearing shorts and flip flops.
12/4/2017,5,$10 sushi box is my favorite! Saturday lunch can be a little crowded but outdoor seating makes for a nice catch-up with friends. Walking distance to many stores and connected to mochi for frozen yogurt.
11/4/2014,3,Quick place with OK food. Sushi Combo Box is the best deal. Ginger Salad and Miso Soup were not good. Sushi was good.
5/16/2015,5,Really good sushi and reasonable price! Love that you order at the counter and that they bring it to your table fast. I think the sushi is very good and I now crave their sushi often! If you love sushi then you won't regret trying this place!
1/15/2017,3,"This is our number one choice for fast food. Don't come here if you are looking for a great sushi place,  but it is good for a quick and inexpensive Japanese/Asian food fix."
6/2/2020,3,"myself and 2 other friends went to bentos we waited in line and ordered in line and we didn't know or see the sign where it said no cash and A guy name david was so rude about my friends and i not having a card and we went and someone offered to pay for us another lady with curly blonde hair in a pony tail she seemed very very bothered about someone paying for us The customer service was really bad except this one curly headed teenage guy with glasses and light-skin, food was good thought."
4/30/2017,5,Huge fan of the spicy salmon/tuna don bowl. I also love making my own. Pretty obsessed tbh
4/20/2019,4,Good bowls and very tasty. The sushi rolls are ok. The noodles are better with the bowls than the rice. The service is slow because the teens running the register have no sense of urgency. Overall good place to eat
6/9/2017,5,"Best sushi in town, best bowls as well. So much food for your money. I have never been disappointed. This is definitely my favorite restaurant here in Jacksonville."
6/11/2014,1,"I really wish that I could give ZERO stars...I have no idea how anyone makes it through a meal at this place. I ended up at Bento on a Sunday evening that happened to coincide with Mother's Day. My companion and I wanted something ""asian"" but all of the Thai restaurants were closed. I didn't want takeout Chinese, and I had heard good things about Bento.Simply put, I will NEVER take restaurant advice again from someone who can recommend Bento as a ""good choice"". I had a sinking feeling as soon as I walked in. Most of the customers were teenagers and younger children. The place was vaguely cool looking but the tables were left unbussed. Against our better judgement, we decided to order. I got something with tofu, companion got chicken katsu. We got spring rolls as an app. The first table that we tried to sit at was located under a leaky spot in the ceiling. I wasn't surprised. We were able to get a new table fairly quickly. The cool ""freestyle"" drink machine was dripping wet and the area around it was not very well maintained. To be fair though, the drink machine was clearly being used as entertainment by the kids, so there's that. My food was out before we even had time to get our drinks. That sounds like a good thing, until I tasted the food. Whoa nelly, I haven't had food that bad in years. The sauce that was on the tofu had so much ginger in it, it tasted like hand sanitizer. It was lukewarm and had been poured onto some equally lukewarm tofu that had clearly been microwaved at some point. The salad dressing suffered a similar fate. The rice was overcooked and unfortunate as well. The room-temperature noodles were edible. The whole thing was a disaster.The spring rolls were your standard frozen and reheated variety. They ended up being the best part of the meal, by a huge margin.While I sat there angrily with my horrific meal, my companion looked on with a rumbly tummy, as his food took an inordinate amount of time to show up. We had to remind the staff about it twice. When he finally got his food, he ate it with a sad look on his face. He was starving so he accepted it. He said that his food also tasted like hand sanitizer because of the amount of ginger in it.We were both very unhappy after that experience. In fact, our experience at Bento was so bad that it has become an in-joke between the two of us. That's not a good thing..."
7/29/2015,5,"Outstanding place. Listen, this isn't super high end sushi. But it's above decent, and at a really good price. It's very ""Americanized,"" and that's just fine by me. The combo box is a great bargain, and they have a huge selection to choose from. Really friendly service too. Get the shrimp sauce."
5/21/2019,4,Nice love this place and the pao pao chicken. So yummy yummy in my tummy tummy . Highly recommended this place. Plus they have frozen yogurt right beside it .
1/2/2014,5,"My friend put me on this place and I was addicted for like 3 weeks. I prob spent 100$ in that time. lol This is where I go to treat my self. Their Sushi BOMB!, their orange chick BOMB-digity and the Sweet sour chicken BOMB.org/mylife. Sorry for sounding so wack but this place is amazing and real chicken is used ..White meat not.. chicken pieces or what nots. lol"
11/29/2017,5,"My family and I were traveling over the holiday weekend. On Monday, we stopped for lunch on our way to Orlando. We eat at the Bento near our home fairly regularly, as had some expectations. The food and service were as awesome as always, however, my wife forgot her purse on the back of the chair as we left. She did not realize it was missing until we were arriving at our destination, 2 hours later. I just wanted to thank the team for not only finding it, but holding it for us to pick up the next day.  Thankfully, nothing was missing. What a great staff, professional and good natured.  Truly a great experience, considering the self imposed four-hour round trip.  We will definitely stop in again when we are in the area."
1/5/2014,2,"**Update:My past few visits to Bento have been let downs.  I feel like quality has taken a dive.  Boba balls in the tea were hard (not fresh - think refrigerated rice), salad in my bento box had minute dribble of dressing over dry rubbery lettuce.  Meat was tough.  sadface.  I'm pretty much done going back."
6/13/2017,3,Food is amazing and fast. Great place to stop for a quick bite of fresh sushi. Service needs some work. Food always arrives before my sake! They look well staffed but the floor is filthy and the line is long with plenty of people standing around to open one of the empty registers.
3/14/2017,4,Service was fast and their is military discount! 4 stars for sushi ! Didn't really enjoy the lo mein I tried... but would definitely come back for sushi
7/3/2014,4,I enjoy the tuna don here! It has become my go to choice for lunch. The salmon is also great.
2/16/2014,4,"After being a die-hard Bento fan for years going to the original Gainesville location during college, I was stoked to hear they had opened a Jacksonville location in the town center after I moved here.This is my go-to pick-up place for nights when I'm too tired to cook or just need a sushi fix. I've never had a bad experience here, and I've been here A LOT. The servers are always nice, even when they are slammed with customers. I tend to stick to the chicken pad thai rice bowl and a rotating selection of sushi for the side. Also, make sure to try the boba tea (I've tried tons of flavors and haven't been disappointed yet).You get really large portions of food for the price (I usually can't finish my rice bowls and save the rest for lunch the next day), and the sushi is always made fresh by the chefs right in front of you. I think the quality of food is phenomenal for the price; I've paid much more for lackluster Asian food at other restaurants. At Bento, you can expect to pay under $10 for pretty much everything on the menu, and the flavors are always spot-on.My biggest tip: if you don't like waiting in line, call ahead for a pick-up order and take it home to eat or out on the restaurant's patio.Soo happy to have Bento in Jacksonville! Once you try it, you'll be hooked."
6/5/2015,5,This place is awesome! It's a little different in the ordering and seating. Has the feel of fast food. But the sushi is first class. So far it's the best sushi I have had in Jax. The food is always good and consistent. Parking can be a little difficult at dinner time. There is always takeout too. -Clean-Friendly-good food-5 Stars!
2/19/2017,4,Food was delicious. Clean and beautifully decorated restaurant. Service was friendly and prompt. Love the sushi bar!
10/19/2016,5,"Love this place, always so good... service was fast and friendly. And the food tastes just great! Highly recommend it"
8/7/2015,4,"Bento at town center, take it for what it is. The sushi is pretty good and the bento boxes are great and will definitely fill your ever-expanding tummy with the large portion. The chicken Katsu is really good thin slices of fried white meat chicken with a crispy breading on the outside that even my American friend who has never eaten Asian food before agrees it's good. However, I would not recommend any noodle stir fry dish or boba drink. The noodles stir fry is a yellow glutinous noodle that does not taste that well in my opinion,  and the bobas don't taste like their intended flavor. Sushi and bento boxes you can't go wrong...service is always good too."
4/10/2016,4,"Really tasty! I've been here several times and have always been really happy with the food.  The take out can be a little slow, but it is usually worth the wait! Also, I always have leftovers."
8/22/2014,3,"Bento Cafe is our usual go-to place for a quick lunch when we are near Town Center area.  I usually order their chicken yellow curry bento, asking for them to add more spice (otherwise it's just really mild).  The yellow curry is not overly sweet, which is nice.  I've also tried a wide variety of their other dishes and sushi.  Bulgogi beef, pork chop noodle soup, for example, are also pretty good.It is a semi self service joint: you place your order at the counter, they give you a number stand, you grab your drink (if you ordered any) at the cool Coke machine, and then seat yourself to wait for server to bring you your food.  A few issues here and there, but a fairly consistent one especially when they are busy, is that food do not come out at the same time for the entire table.  Sometimes it is minor, a few min late, sometimes it's downright annoying (everyone else eat while you watch).  Sometimes I notice their yellow curry is not consistent.  A few times it is bland and other times it's stellar.  Nevertheless, it is a pretty good place for a quick lunch if going early or late to avoid the crowd."
3/11/2015,5,"One of my Jacksonville favorite places. The ambience and environment of this place is great. It's a casual, cool environment that leaves guests feeling comfortable. Can get loud just like any restaurant.The menu is large, but never went wrong ordering food here. My favorite without a doubt would probably have to be the sushi combo with the Mt. Fuji roll and always something different. 16 pieces of sushi for 10 bucks, along with little extras make it perfect. There was one week where I was there four days in a row with one day going twice in the same day. Never leave disappointed and always full."
10/21/2016,5,So yummy I can't wait to go back. I tried the shrimp pad Thai which was a big portion and made perfectly. The staff is nice and they are quick. Clean environment. Def recommend.
5/3/2015,4,"The sushi tastes very fresh, and the service is good. They have a pretty wide variety of choices. They also have some deals, so you can dine for under $11 if you get a sushi box, and it's a good amount of food. On the weekdays from 3-6 they have buy two rolls get one free. They also have also have rice bowls with meat and hibachi style food if you don't like sushi, but I only come for the sushi, although my friend liked the chicken he got when he came with me."
3/4/2014,5,Haters love to hate on this place.  I like the sushi and the noodle bowls.  Can't beat the location either.This place delivers through doorstep delivery.  We've done it several times when we were feeling lazy.  Sushi delivery is when you know Jacksonville isn't a hick town any longer.My miso soup today is full of tofu and very tasty.  I used to eat here back in my college days at UF in Gainesville.  I'm glad to see they are doing well as a business.  They are opening another location right down the street in Tinseltown.
2/3/2017,4,I had recently come back from a visit to VA where I had tried Pokéworks for the first time. It was so good and I was super bummed they aren't down here. So I was very happy to see that Bento Cafe had poké bowls! I got one with salmon and tuna and it really good. I just wish the rice had been a bit stickier.
6/21/2017,4,"This is a great food stop, and you can't go wrong coming here if you're in the area.  Even if you don't end up liking it, it's a great stop in jacksonville"
11/28/2014,3,"Waited in a long line to order. No drink pricing on the menu, I see why. Over price drinks. After sitting down and waiting for our food to find out the shrimp sauce cost extra. Really after spending $30 for lunch on my debit card I didn't have any cash for sauce. Needless to say I'm not impressed at all. The dynamite to roll was deep-fried it was good but it wasn't hot. The saukee was lukewarm I like mine hot."
9/8/2016,5,"I discovered Bento while taking my son to UNF.  You order at the counter, get a number, find a seat if you can - they are so busy! - wait for your food to be delivered and DEVOUR it!  I always hope the line is long enough so I can figure out what I want from their pretty extensive menu.  There are so many options and EVERYTHING is delicious!  I love the monitor that displays the dishes because then I get to see which item makes me drool more - and that is what I order.  All the plates are filling.  Excellent!"
5/2/2016,3,"Bento café is a place where if you want something fast and somewhat inexpensive, this is the place. The food overall is okay. Its not a 5 star but its good and edible. I used to come here if I had a long day at work or just wanted something fast and get it to go. At first I thought the food was pretty good but as I have gone the last few times it seems they have been slacking. Not sure if its just been my luck but I love there Pad Thai and its been pretty dry the last times I got it."
4/26/2016,5,Very friendly staff! Everyone is always smiling and working hard. Food is amazing !! Get the Bali Hai Mango roll!
6/11/2014,4,"I haven't tried Bentos before today. Great atmosphere, food, and service. Try too get in before noon for lunch, the line really becomes steady. #asiancuisine #delish #bentos"
2/13/2017,5,I will be back. Affordable and great sushi. I like the drinks and atmosphere. Love the location and outside seating.
4/30/2016,2,"Not bad. The rice was pretty plain. The portions of fish were small. The rolls were really 1/2 rolls. The fish was pretty good, except for the octopus. The octopus (taco) was not good. I won't be coming back."
1/15/2018,1,"Very disappointed today with Bento!  Usually no problems, and good food, however today the service or shall I say LACK there of!  Placed an order for carry out, server came over with bag and said, ""are you waiting for a carry out order.""  I said, ""Yes"" (we had a number so I figured the server could read the number on the table we were sitting at and the number on the ticket to match it up.  We left, 30 minutes later, getting ready to eat our food and it was not your take out order.  I drive back and tell them it was wrong.  The person at the register said oh yes there was a mix up, here is your order. IT IS NOW ALMOST AN HOUR OLD!  SHE TRIED TO GIVE ME THE ORIGINAL ORDER. I have not idea if someone had taken it out of Bento and brought it back.  I told her I do not want food that is over an hour old.  She places a new ticket and said it would be expedited.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I GET A SORRY, AND NOTHING ELSE, NOT EVEN A CUP FOR WATER WHILE I WAIT.  After waiting 8 minutes, I am told by BRENNA that they are waiting for Odon noodles. I tell her I am not very happy with the service. BRENNA then precedes to tell me it is MY FAULT that I got the wrong carry out order!!!! OMG are you kidding me!  By this time I am just livid!  I ask her her name and she REFUSED to give it to me.  If you are in the service industry you better learn how to deal with people.  I am so disappointed with Bento and how they treat their customers.  Shame on you for your lack of customer service.  I hope you teach BRENNA some manner."
9/14/2016,4,"The team I work with loves to go out for lunch. This has become one of their staples. Someone recommended the Spicy Tuna Tataki Don (with brown rice), based upon the type of food that I typically order. I love this low fat, high protein option for its flavor and fresh ingredients. I need to expand and try other options, but I love my mainstay dish and the team loves all of their selections."
12/17/2016,2,"Not impressed. I had the udon soup with a side of shrimp tempura. The soup tasted a little off (maybe too much dashi?); the shrimp was lacking the signature quality of tempura. The batter was heavy which gave a hard crunch, not the light coating one expects with a tempura. The flavor of the shrimp was non-existent.   I had to ask for the tempura dipping sauce and it was  horrendous. I swear she just brought a small container of pure soy sauce.The atmosphere is fun and open, but not somewhere that I would revisit. Maybe I am a little jaded because I have been searching for a good noodle place for a long while... NE Florida needs a good authentic noodle place. Until then.. I'll make my own"
10/22/2009,3,"Since I'm a Mochi fiend, I've also been watching the progress of Bento's opening next door.  The smiley girl that kinda manages Mochi is now working at Bento too and she told me they have the same owner.  Thanks Smiley girl.  No...not you...the other one...yeah...you.Anyway, so I was kinda lookin' forward to trying out Bento to see what they would bring.  I need A game here in Jacksonville...a city of B game wannabe's.So, went with a friend to Bento today for lunch.  As a dutiful Yelper, I tried a few things on the menu just to make it a more appropriate review.Hmm...so they are Pan-Asian, meaning they try to do a lot of different things at once.  I am not sure that's a good thing, but I'll roll with it.  I dunno how you can expect to be an expert at making really good Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Sushi...but that's what they are going for.  So they have ""Cantonese Pork Chops"", General Tso's Chicken, Pad Thai, Katsu, Bulgogi and some soupy noodle dishes just to name a few.  As I said, it's quite broad.  Perhaps they are just counting on Jax people not to know the difference.  I'm sure that's it.We ordered 3 things...the Spicy Korean Chicken, the Creamy Spicy Shrimp, and the Cantonese Pork Chops.  The chicken was good though not spicy.  It was stir-fried chicken with a lot of both green and white onions.  In fact, it was mostly onion. The pork chops were lightly glazed in a sweet, almost BBQ sauce (though not so tomatoey), served cut and boneless over white rice.  Each of the above was ordered as a Bento box, meaning it came with some flash fried green beans, salad, rice and some chow mein noodles.   The green beans were warm, but good.  The rest of the sides were more of an after thought.  Wilted lettuce, luke warm noodles with a few pieces of cabbage...The Creamy Spicy Shrimp were kind of embarrassing.  The flavor of the sauce was good...but you can find that same, thick, sweet orange sauce across the way at Panda Express.  The shrimp themselves were ridiculous, precooked, super tiny, pieces of mushiness, hidden amongst a blanket of batter.  Plus they only give you 6.  Hello...this is the coast...Mayport is right over there (points) and they have fresh shrimp.Portions were average.  We had 3 dishes but I was still hungry enough to get 12 oz of Mochi after.  Perhaps they planned it that way.We each had a boba tea drink that was good.  I had Milk Tea and my friend had green tea.  I'd go back for that.The decor was nice.  Clean, modern.  Black, box lit tables, blue tones throughout.  There were both booths and small tables.Service was obviously new and figuring out how to serve.  They were nice though, just new at it.  You order from the counter (where the Smiley girl works) and they give you a number and you go sit down.  They then bring you the food.Overall...A-ok...not 4 stars...and definitely not 5 stars like Mochi next door.  I'd give 3.5 for the effort.  I'll go back, just to try other things.  If they get some better shrimp, they might get another star.  If they served beer and wine that'd help too."
8/8/2015,5,"This is a go-to dinner spot when I'm at Towncenter -- perfect for those who are always wearing wrinkled clothes and can't afford valet. Seriously, there's a lot of high end places at Towncenter, surrounded by a lot of Chick-fil-a and Pollo Tropical around the perimeter. Bento is a perfect in-between for me. I usually go for the sushi bowl -- not sure why. It's like deconstructed sushi and the salmon-tuna combo is divine. I can't remember the name. But anyway, you get big chunks of sashimi atop a bowl of rice and it's less than $9. Can't beat that! I sent a picture to my out-of-town friend once and he predicted it was more like $25! The servings are plentiful. They also have the fancy soda machine with the touchscreen, so if you're into that..."
2/28/2011,4,"Right away I loved Bento Cafe.  The only confusing thing was the sign above the building that say Pan-Asian Cuisine and not Bento Cafe.  I understand that is their slogan, but it can be confusing to a first timer.That being said, I fell in love with their Bento boxes.  You pick the main portion of the meal and they serve it to you on a tray with little compartments with other little servings of things like noodles, salad with ginger dressing, broccoli and an orange.I need to go back to try some of the other offerings, although I just know I will be tempted to get another Bento box!"
3/9/2013,1,"I'm a foodie at heart. So when I go to a place, and 30 minutes after I've eaten at a place I need to use the rest room, I tend to be leery of going back. This is what happened when I ate here. I even gave it another chance since, I figure, everyone has an off night-maybe it was a fluke. But it happened. Two more times, in fact. Now, you can say that maybe I just have a weak stomach. Or that I just pick really bad entrees. Doesn't matter. When I spend money to eat somewhere, I'm not expecting to have to make an emergency restroom run because the food didn't agree with me! Suffice to say, I will NEVER go back. Three times was bad enough."
11/2/2009,3,"Recently gave the new Bento Café a try.  We have been to other bento café locations (Gainesville and Orlando), and thought their food was decent for the price.  So we are pretty happy that there is now a Bento in Jacksonville as well.First of all, as you walk in, there is a person to greet you and ask if you have tried Bento Café before.  Smart move, because many people looked lost.  Having someone at the entrance to go over the ordering process and the menu is indeed very helpful.  Since we are familiar with the menu, we jumped ahead and ordered.  The four of us ordered the Cantonese pork chop bento, the Bulgogi beef bento, the Japanese pork chop bento, and tempura shrimp udon.  And of course, I had to try a buba tea.The bentos were all good.  I especially liked the bulgogi.  However, the udon was disappointing, not so much the noodle or the broth, but the 3 little tempura shrimp... how sad.  The boba was decent, but a bit too sweet and too much milk.  Well, it's a tall order to make boba in this town when Aroma makes excellent boba.Overall, the welcoming atmosphere, friendly service, convenient location (when shopping at the Town Center), decent food and price makes this a good place for a quick meal when shopping at the Town Center.  Of course, being next to Mochi helps a lot too."
9/7/2018,1,We come to bentos frequently it's usually a good experience and great food. It was a Friday night but we got the main course meals in 15 minutes but never got are sushi chicken tempura. We asked a server 3x and almost finished are meals till we asked for the money back. The manager (Jessica) said they accidentally gave it to the wrong table and if we still wanted it that it should be out soon. We declined and asked for the money back and the money for the Bobo tea. The manager didn't offer any incentive . Well thanks for starting the night with apologies and bad experience . Won't be going here again.
4/22/2013,4,"A nice Asian fusion restaurant right next to the Mochi froyo place. These two should do the trick in fulfilling your Asian food cravings around Jacksonville!I thought we were waiting for a table when the lady asked me for my order. I was apparently in line to put in an order, prior to being led to a table. The menu was pretty straightforward, so it didn't take long to decide on my lunch.The atmosphere is fairly casual and trendy. Prices are comparable to bentos in NYC. Their udon noodles and Korean bbq over rice were delicious. Would like to return to try other things."
11/2/2013,2,"This place if you look at the floor,wall, Restroom is so dirty. The owner must never care of it.  Service and food was alright. I just can't sit down and eat to look at those finger print on the wall."
7/31/2015,5,"I've been coming here for several years and never been disappointed. This isn't your typical New York style Chinese take-out place. The food is amazing!! My favorite is the udon stir fry noodle bowl but there are many other Asian dishes to choose from. Also, food is served to you within 5-10 min. Expect a rush during lunch on weekdays as this is a popular spot."
10/14/2019,1,"Hoping for a great new place to take my family for dinner. We came here to order boba tea as dessert, and after reviewing the menu, we were excited to come here in the near future to try the food on the menu. We ordered three large taro boba teas. Now I am not a professional boba tea connoisseur, but the boba tea I received was not only a pale cream color, it tasted nothing like taro. I've had taro boba tea many times over many years, and this was not it. When I asked if the boba tea we received was taro, they said yes. I accepted it and went back outside to my family, but it just wasn't taro. I went in a second time, and stated that it just didn't taste or look like taro at all. The lady stated they got a new manufacturer, and it isn't as purple anymore. There was never any attempt or concern of customer satisfaction. I threw my boba tea away and won't be taking my family back. There are better places with better service."
5/31/2010,3,"Finally tried out Bento cause we like to get yogurt at Mochi. First I'll start off with the bad. The teas. I love milk tea with boba. I've drank it in Las Vegas, Orlando, New York, Miami, Vancouver, Sydney, Jacksonville and Taipei (where it originated). The one here was nothing to rave about. It's like milk with a touch of tea. It's suppose to be the other way around. The boba was fine for my taste. Just the milk tea was not too milky. The worst was the thai tea that my girlfriend order. She's had thai tea many times before however this was not even close to thai tea. I tasted it and it goes from a tea flavor to a sour flavor at the end. No way should it be sour. It was truly disgusting. We asked a server if it was definitely thai tea. He did offer for something else but we declined since they were 0 for 2 on speciality teas. Horrible thai tea. The good is the food. We enjoyed it. I had the bulgolgi beef. Good flavor. Not too salty. The lo mein noodles that came with it were dry. The ginger salad was ok. I've had better in other Japanese restaurants. She had the Japanese curry chicken. She enjoyed it. Atmosphere was okay. Loud music in there. Food came out quickly. Prices were reasonable. Just don't drink the tea."
5/26/2013,4,"We really liked it.  I got the red curry with chicken.  The menu gave it one pepper, and sure enough it had some heat, but was really good.  I got the bento plate, which to the unfamiliar comes with some white rice, the de riguer iceberg+ginger dressing salad, some Asian green beans, and some asian style noodles.  A really filling plate of food for $9.  Daughter got the shrimp pad thai with noodles (I think that it's like getting it with extra noodles).  It was a huge bowl of pad thai for 9 or 10 bucks. Wife got some kind of soy chicken that allegedly had some heat, but did not have as much as my red curry.Really liked it, need to get this franchise to Atlanta!"
11/1/2009,4,"I went shopping today at Town Center mall, and it came upon lunchtime.  I am not a big fan of the chain restaurants there, and, being a party of 1, wanted somewhere that I would not be lost in.  I started off for home with the intention of grabbing something interesting, if it presented itself, and if not, find something on the way home.I saw Bento Cafe from the road, and it triggered my interest.  I drove by and noticed that it was busy, and that it was advertising itself as Pan Asian, but definitely had sushi.  I walked in and there was a line of 12 or so waiting to be seated.  I craned my neck to find the sushi bar, noted that it was empty except for one person, and headed there.  I sat down and started reading the book I was carrying.Some time passed, perhaps 8-10 minutes, and no server had approached.  I could see clearly now that the line at the door was not a line to be seated as much as it was a line to order!  Even, so, I had not been to a sushi restaurant where the bar was NOT first-come first-served.  So I sat for a minute or two more.A server approached me and asked if she could help me.  Almost immediately I realized my mistake and asked about it.  Did I break the process?  This server, J., said with a warm smile that I had, but apologized to me and offered to bring menus.  There are two menus, sushi and non.  The non menu had dishes you could order 3 ways, Bento box, over noodles and I think with rice, not sure about the third.  It also had soups you could order with Udon noodle base.  I insisted that I only wanted the Spicy Beef Soup and nothing else, but J. talked me into a sushi roll.  I ordered a simple roll that was a California roll with tuna on top.  The chef in front of me, B., prepared it and handed it to me.  We did not speak aside from my ""thank you.""The soup was in a beef broth, as one might expect for a soup with sliced beef in it.  The broth was the best part.  The noodles were plentiful and took on the broth flavor fine.  The beef was seasoned well, but got tough pretty quickly as it continued to cook in the broth.  Not too tough to eat, just a little work for the cheek muscles.  There were a few veggies in the soup as well.J. continued to bring me soda refills, even though the dispenser was right behind me.  As I worked on the soup, a big spoon appeared as well as an extra napkin.  The sushi roll was under $7.00, large and very very fresh.  I could smell the cucumber in the roll, even with the tuna on top.  It required a dip in the proximity of my ginger and soy dish for a little saltiness to bring out the flavor.  This is in contrast to most sushi restaurants in Jax where I prefer to drown the thing.  It was a very good texture in the mouth for what it contained: crunch soft, crunch.About halfway through the sushi, B. handed me a plate with another sushi roll.  I was sure he was joking, trying to break the ice with the guy that's been sitting in front of him for more than 30 minutes.  He wasn't joking.  He had prepared another roll that had eel on top of a CA. roll, for me.  For a flash moment I thought he might be pushing food on me to raise my tab.  But that soon passed as he made it clear it was on him.  (I hope he doesn't get in trouble for doing so, and I hope that using his initial and not his name obscures his identity enough. I want to give him credit, not grief.)As I looked at it, and at the same moment J. returned to check on me, I recalled how polarizing eel is.  Some people love it, many won't touch it.  My entire family won't touch it.  So I said to B. ""How did you know I would even eat eel?  I like it, but we haven't spoken 3 words until you handed it to me.""  He said that he didn't, he just took a chance.  Pretty confident.I asked J. to bring me a togo container for my soup.  She insisted on taking it and doing it herself.  ""It makes a big mess, let me take care of it.""  I finished the sushi.  Both rolls.  I was stuffed.  Happy stuffed.The atmosphere was simple, with an open ceiling and few decorations.  The ordering actually works exactly like Mama Fu's, counter order then sit with a number.  Which is not to say that it's LIKE Mama Fu's.  I really appreciate how I misread the entire situation at first and J. absolutely refused to allow it to be an awkward situation.  It was clearly my mistake.  Otherwise, I really liked the variety on the menu and the soup I had was good.  If they can stay busy and keep the fish fresh, they will do well.  Crazy Sushi is nearby and has set a high bar for sushi quality around Tinseltown, but I recommend Bento Cafe.I have to add one final note.  There was nothing about my outward appearance that would suggest I needed to be treated like royalty.  I looked like I had just stopped walking behind my lawnmower and decided to hit the mall.  I know that reviews of restaurants where the reviewer received a freebie and hard to take at face value.  But I would to thank B. and J. for treating me so well."
1/4/2016,3,"Just another typical Asian restaurant. Sushi is expensive and the food seemed to be pretty mediocre. I heard good things about the place until I showed up and saw for myself. Don't get me wrong, its good. If you're looking for basic level Asian cuisine, this is your place."
2/27/2013,3,"Pretty Good. My daughter's favorite place to eat. She always gets the Create a Don. Sashimi chunks of salmon and slices of udon on a sticky rice with some yummy spicy mayo and some kind of seaweed looking salad garnish. I think some shredded beet too. I've had it, but just the salmon, and it is indeed tasty. Would have given it 4 stars if staff were a bit friendlier, and if it was always good. Once, the entire dish was warm, which tasted a bit weird."
3/23/2013,5,"As a fan of Thai and sushi, I discovered this restaurant as a recommendation by my boss and was not disappointed. Since then, I have been here as least 4 times and brought friends and family with me and they have enjoyed the food as well.The bowls are big and hold a lot of food. I tried the Pad Thai and absolutely love it! One of the best in the area! The sushi bento boxes are an awesome deal and you get tons of sushi! I try a new roll everytime and absolutely love the freshness and quality of the sushi. Lastly, I've become addicted to the Green Boba Tea with the pearls. Chewy balls of fun with every sip! My only gripe is that it is not close to me but then if it were, I would be broke! :) Highly recommended!!"
2/4/2011,4,"I LOVE the concept of this place. I wish I had a place just like this where I live, but then I'd have to eat there all the time. My husband and I both got the Sushi Combo Box for lunch, which is another great concept, a whole California Roll and 2 half rolls of our choice. I got the Mt Fuji roll and the Mexican roll, both wonderful and my husband got the Yoshi Roll and the Special Mexican Roll, again wonderful. I will have to come back and try the Bento boxes and the noodles."
4/12/2010,2,"Garbage.I have never been moved to review a restaurant before but am now inspired. ""Asian Fusion"" is a correct category as this place is fusion, i.e. bastardization of Japanese food and Fail.No sir, you need not learn anything of Japanese food or culture in opening a Japanese styled restaurant. Katsudon? Not here. The maguro was oversized and bland. The amaebi served on a bed of beet shavings. The sushi chefs... Latin gentlemen with Japanese styled goatees.The wait staff was super friendly. Very cute young ladies.But a word of advice: use plenty of soy sauce. Thank God the Kirin was bottled... At least they can't screw that up."
11/11/2014,5,"Whenever the answer to ""What are you in the mood for?"" is ""noodles"", I immediately start thinking of reasons to be in the vicinity of Bento.  I used to live very nearby and would stop in whenever I was shopping at the Town Center or for any flimsy reason, but now that I'm on the other side of town I feel like I have to have another reason to be in the area so that I can eat my noodles!But when I do invent a reason to go to REI or that specific Target or whatever, I know that Bento has my back for a delicious lunch or dinner, but never at actual lunch or dinner time because I would never eat.  This place is packed at meal times, and for good reason.  Everything I've tried on the menu, I have enjoyed, and the rice plates and noodle bowls are an amazing value for the money.  (The sushi is less so, but there are so many other places for sushi nearby that it seems silly to come here for that!)  My go-to dishes are the pad thai or the pad ki mao (aka drunken noodles), always at ""level 2 spicy"" for that extra kick in the mouth.  My husband will eat almost anything on the menu, but now that we're there less often he sticks with the spicy cream, from which I always snag a tasty tempura meat.  If you're looking for authentic Thai or Korean or Japanese food, this is probably not the place to go, but if you like the ""Pan-Asian"" style you'll be happy here!Bento is also wonderful for its friendly wait staff and surprisingly quick service (not so much so when the place is full, but still pretty fast!).  They are even willing to grab you a to-go box or extra chopsticks when you forget that those items are sitting out waiting for you to go get them yourself.  If they ever open up a store near my new place, I will be in noodle heaven."
6/28/2015,3,"It was okay food. I had the udon noodle soup, I was surprised I didn't get sick. My sister had the XOXO sushi and she really liked it. It was packed and the line was out the door but I'm not sure what's the hype."
2/28/2011,3,"The sushi is great and they let you have dogs in their outdoor seating. I still only give them three stars because I think they are overpriced. I didn't order the edamame because of my previous experience. The puppy and I enjoyed some delish sushi last night in the cool, February air. Thanks, Bento!(No, I did not give my dog sushi. She's too picky for that, anyway!)"
4/27/2011,4,"Bento is really great.  It's the only pan-Asian place worth anything on the south side of town.  (can I just wag my finger at the guy who gave Bento one star because *he* doesn't like it and his friends always want to go there?  That's just douchey...if you don't like it, rate it objectively, and don't take off points because you're mad at your friends.)  Their service is really great, and they always do a good job of moving the lunch rush crowd through, even considering that there is a high concentration of folks who have irritating habits that tend to slow down the line.  Their katsu pork is delicious, and their sushi is good as well.  I also like their pad Thai, and the boba tea is delicious.My only gripes?1.  The dining room is NOISY!  They need to hang some sound-absorbing art or lay some carpet.2.  There is not enough outdoor seating.3.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider putting a traditional Japanese Ramen dish on the menu!!!!!"
7/3/2010,4,"So, I am quite a lover of Asian cuisine and pride myself on taking on new gastronomic experiences. I heard about Bento (blue) Cafe from a coworker of mine and decided it's been too long if i have to hear about a new place from a coworker! (Usually I'm the one finding new places!)   So I will admit there are two pics, they are of sushi and of a Bento box I chose for dinner one weekday with my spouse. I like having options (which they have aplenty) since I'm not a seafood eater. I tried Mongolian chicken without onions ,it came with ginger salad, steamed rice with sesame seeds, lo mien noodles and fruit garnish. The portions for the price are QUITE on the small side, but flavorful. I also had a Malibu milk/bubble tea with pearls which was VERY tasty and will from now on ask for no pearls. I forget I don't like the tapioca bubbles. The hubs had the Red Dragon roll (VERY VERY tasty he says) Cali roll, and some Nigiri (salmon and mackerel) which he says were Very good.   The atmosphere was laid back, pan Asian fusion is how I'd describe it and small. The walking wasn't bad at all considering it IS at the Town Center.   I can definitely say as long as we can still find parking (i suppose that's hit or miss ) we will Definitely be coming back! Besides , when you go on Monday you get two bucks off with your receipt next door at Mochi- try the Taro with sweetened condensed milk BTW!"
2/26/2013,4,Ok so the four is not for food quality but menu quantity.  I love being able to get all my favorite dishes and drinks in one place.  It makes for very interesting combos and a fun night out.  Also the staff is always nice and helpful.The prices are a little high for the quantity and quality but still tasty so I would give the food a 3.I will go back but not as a regular.  Maybe once every other month.
2/1/2015,4,The salmon salad is amazing!  Their curry tastes like a cheap sauce from a can.  I strictly stick with the salad.  Great prices!
6/27/2011,4,Sandcastle roll- which is not on the menu is fantastic. Really great sushi and even better noodle and rice bowls.
10/7/2010,2,"Decor is ok. You order at the counter and find an open seat to wait for the food. The food comes out real quick. However, the food is not good. If people are raving about this restaurant, they need to venture over to a decent place pronto. Take a visit to SF or NYC. Get out a bit more.The food is greasy and just too oily. The flavor is very sub-par. They give you a good sized portion, but quantity does not make up for a lack off quality.The only thing I liked about this place was they served nigori sake (sho chiku bai brand)."
6/28/2013,1,Lame. Totally horrible. It's an insult to Asian cuisine. The stuck up staff is not much help.Go to Pei Wei which is better by leaps and bounds.This place only has customers because of its location.RUN AWAY!!!!
6/28/2015,4,Very enjoyable. Delicious. Large menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food to the table.
2/2/2015,2,"The concept is great - fast casual sushi and a large selection of Asian dishes. The service was very friendly and fast and the atmosphere is beautiful and fun. However, the food was really mediocre at best and way way overpriced. Unfortunate and really disappointing experience."
8/31/2011,4,"Just tried this place for lunch with a coworker and was pleasantly surprised. We had to wait in a line for almost 20 minutes, which I was not a fan of during the lunch hour, but they made up for it with the food. We both had sushi and I had very low expectations. I have yet to find a sushi place in Jacksonville that matches the quality of almost any sushi restaurant in San Francisco or Seattle, but I thought it was pretty good. It didn't have me doing cartwheels, but I'll definitely go back. The ambiance is actually what sold me in the end. It's sleek and modern, and made me feel like I wasn't in Jacksonville for a moment. Parking and traffic in general is probably always going to be a pain at this place. It's the Town Center, so deal with it. Oh, and there's a Yobe next door, which I don't get (didn't we already do the whole frozen yogurt fad in the 90s?) but a lot of people seem to like."
6/12/2015,4,"I love THIS bento- Bento blue. I prefer this over Red any day. Their sushi is fresh and beautiful, the service is great. It would be a five start eating but they need some renovations! Their AC was leaking to the point of dropping on the floor! Also- the booths are in bad shape. I will update my review if these improvements are made. I will still go for their yummy Asian dishes! Yum!"
11/13/2015,4,"Another one of my favorite lunch places - the sushi is above average, the soups (whether the noodle soups or appetizer soups) are lukewarm (which I took a star off for alongwith a so-so drunken noodles I had there), but the spicy salmon don, spicy cream chicken (picture deep-fried chicken pieces in a suprisingly delicious lightly spiced cream sauce) were a big hit with the family.You get a choice of whether you want your meal in a bento (a little bit of everything - noodles, rice, salad, green beans, etc), with noodles, or on rice.  Lots of options and a fun place to hit up for lunch."
7/30/2011,3,"Sub-par sushi.. Not bad but not great. I won't go out of my way to eat there; but if I am in town center and feel like eating sushi, bento is good enough.The ""boxes"" are not very good but the ""bowls"" are decent (same quality as panda express)."
9/17/2010,4,"I love Bento Cafe, it is a very chic modern fast food asian restaurant.  Great Decor, every time I've been there has been lots of people on staff, always busy, sometimes you need to wait a few minutes to snag a table.I usually get the udon noodle bowl.  The portion is HUGE, and I typically take half of it home.  I love that there are bottles of sriracha easily accessible to kick the noodles up to another level. Great bang for your buck here.  save some room for mochi next door!"
3/5/2011,3,"This place was okay... Wife got Chicken Katsu and myself Beef Pad Thai.  The Katsu's breading fell off... katsu doesn't do that unless did wrong... part of my pad Thai was cold.  Got bento box, came with string beans, rice, salad w/ ginger sauce.  the dressing was VERY skimpy on the salad, but to their credit, i don't care for string beans, but I ate all of them gladly, those were crisp and seasoned nicely.  It was a tad overpriced for what you got.  Very crowded place as well... Mochi's next door was alot more fun if seeking a snack.Oh yeah, forgot a key thing... Wife was excited for Katsu sauce... we got plain BBQ... yuck."
9/24/2015,2,"The menu is amazing and it looks like it would be great but the food always makes me sick! Not to mention, I ALWAYS see their staff out back smoking and hanging out around the trash and they look filthy! No wonder I always get sick!"
7/22/2017,1,"The worst meal i ever had today. I was here a lot of time before. Today i got ramen, which was so plain, tasteless. The taro milk tea and original milk tea were super nasty sweet that we had to put half glass of water and ice in so we can drink it. Sushi is fine not much to complain. There were no wonder why there were not a lot of customers here  on a beautiful saturday lunch time, which i used to wait a long line to get order. Very disappointed. I dont think i could come back here."
5/20/2015,1,"Extremely dirty restaurant. We even had to wave flies away from our lunch the whole time. Floors, tables, chairs and silverware all have smudges, dirt, drips and are sticky. Will not be back unless I have a blindfold. :/ needs new management!!!"
7/10/2015,3,"The environment is nice.  Can get too crowded during peak hours which at times affects operational capacity more than most places. The sushi there is very good, however.  Best to go when first opened, earlier in the evening or before closing hours."
1/15/2014,4,"One of the Best cafe shop in the city.I really love this place , i have visited here for 2 to 3 times and and always had a great coffee. Fantastic coffee , very friendly environment and also fast services. I would recommend it to everyone."
2/28/2014,4,"I can't believe this is my first time coming here since I've been yelping. It has definitely been a while since I've been here. This visit was no different from any other for me though. The Sushi is always fresh and delicious, not to mention very beautifully presented. Their other food items are always very delicious also. There is only one thing I really don't care for on the Menu (I've tried everything here) which is the Korean chicken. I find it lacks flavor. Not caring for one dish out of the many they offer is pretty damn good, in my opinion anyway. Another small gripe is seating, It can be a pain to find one on very busy nights. The employees are usually very friendly. They always have an awesome attitude and I usually get three or four ""Have a good night"" on my way out from them. Tonight was the first night that I've seen the line well out the front door! But I can totally understand why though. This place rocks. Oh, and I noticed on my visit here tonight that they have now linked Mochi and Bento Cafe together with a doorway within the restaurant."
12/14/2014,1,Worst boba tea I have ever taste.  I recently order two taro boba milk tea.  Just from the look of it that it was going to be awful.  The first slip was full of syrup and had no taro flavor.  The boba it self was way undercook and was super hard.  Either they didn't cook it or it was really old.  This place has the lowest quality of sushi I have ever seen but you pay for what you get there.  Qcup boba is way better.  Sushi at town-center over is aweful.
6/17/2012,4,"A word to the wise: get here at 11:30 or 12:45...otherwise, pick somewhere else for lunch (especially if you're on a time crunch during the week). The food is consistently good, which is why there's always a line out the door during peak hours. Another pointer: they will NOT take any more orders if the entire restaurant is seated so do everyone else a favor; don't be a jerk and ""save seats""..you won't get your food any faster, mmkay? I have this problem...I don't like change...therefore I can comment solely on the spicy tuna don, because that's all I've ever gotten here. Oh, and the spring rolls. Those are good too. The general tso's chicken looks and smells good, and I've heard rave reviews about their sushi."
5/10/2015,5,One of my favorite sushi places. I've tried several things from the sushi and regular menu and everything has been delicious.
9/3/2012,4,"A friend of mine who lives in Jacksonville now suggested this place to meet up for lunch. The place was PACKED, especially for such a rainy day. Tables and chairs were strategically packed together to use up the space as efficiently as possible. Be kind and don't linger too long if you see that the place is full, so that other patrons may order and eat, too.Peruse the menu as you stand in line and order when you get to the register. You pick the meats/style you want and MOST items can be made into your choice of a bento box, noodle bowl, or rice dish (some cannot, and will specify so next to the style). Everything is pretty Americanized, but still quite delectable. They're very quick and prices are fair for the portion you receive. They are also very accommodating to customizing your order."
11/21/2013,5,"Spicy creamy chicken noodle bowl is so yummy! The pad Thai chicken is also so great! If you have a big appetite for yummy food, come here!"
9/23/2017,3,Good sushi but the wait is so long! I never understand why only one register is open when there could be 30 people in line waiting. I think if they had two registers going the experience would be more pleasant.
3/9/2010,3,"Was very excited an Asian Fusion place opened up near the St. John's Towne Center. Hubby seems to live at Golf Galaxy and I will go along for the ride, provided we can stop and have Happy Hour Sushi in Bento's. Bento's has a Volcano Roll that is AWESOME! OK, ok, it is not typical sushi, but Asian Fusion. This is a huge futomaki with a warm crab meat mixed with spicy sauce sitting on the top. Order 2 of these and get a third roll free -- as their happy hour is 3 rolls for the price of 2. We also ordered 2 soups and hot green tea and got out of there with about $30 to include tip. On Monday night, you can take your receipt next door to MOCHI for a dollar off of the price of soft serve frozen yogurt with all of the fixins. Bento's has adequate seating with a wait staff that brings your order to the table. There are signs posted that say, ""do not sit before ordering"" so therefore, one must order food before taking up table space.  After coming here several times, the only reason we're giving it 3 stars out of 5 is the way the restaurant is set up:  Order first from a HUGE menu -- oh, that is, from TWO Menu's. Then pay, then sit. We've watched the efficiency of the restaurant come to a stand still as customers line up outside waiting to order from this huge menu. It would be so much better if the wait staff seated you, then came to take your order, like other restaurants, only because of the large line at the entrance and the confused looks on first time attendees.  After all, the wait staff brings your items to your table anyhow. And we always leave a tip. So we think a full service wait staff set up would be more efficient than how it is set up now.  I do recommend trying the other items on the menu as we've been back 4-5 times in the last 2 months. Food is yummy and affordable! This place also serves Boba Tea!  If you are coming in at dinner time, especially on Fri or Sat, don't expect to be seated right away as this place stays busy at dinner time."
12/27/2011,4,"This place is delicious! Great for families and kids too. The bento box is a great choice if you are having a hard time deciding, it's like a sampler plate. The noodle bowls are also good and the boba tea too! My favorite is the orange boba tea!"
4/6/2010,3,"Didn't expect to find a boba/bubble tea place in Jacksonville, but I did a local search online and found the Bento Cafe. The boba was decent. Had the thai tea one. Will definitely be back to try one of the bento boxes on my next trip to Jacksonville."
2/13/2015,4,"I tend to not favor chain restaurants, but Bento is an exception to the rule.  Also, many Asian fusion joints have strengths, like great sushi or hibachi while everything else might be mediocre, but Bento has multiple strengths and offers fairly authentic cuisine from various cultures.  I usually have a sushi combination that comes with a ginger seaweed salad which is surprisingly delicious.  Their boba milk tea is good, but a little too sweet compared to other venues.  Bento tends to get packed, so it's best for those who don't mind people watching.  This location seems to be generally clean, is aesthetically pleasing, and I've never had service that wasn't fast and friendly."
2/12/2010,3,"I like that it has so many varieties in regards to the food and drinks but it's just Ok.  Please don't put Aroma Corner out of business!! I would die without my Jasmine milk tea with tea jelly! Anyways, hubby usually gets a noodle bowl and I get a bento box, 1 sushi roll and two boba drinks, which will typically runs over $30, which I feel is a bit much. Taste: I've had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and I don't know if that's how its suppose to taste because I'm pretty sure my mom doesn't make it like that.  The turnaround time on food is pretty quick so maybe flavor is sacrificed a bit.  The sushi rolls we've had so far has been pretty good.  Boba drinks are pretty good as well. Portion: Reasonable and what I expected. Service: Good - The girls bring the food to your table, Price: $$ - $$$ - Depends on how much you get - we like to eat =DDecore/Ambiance: Modern-ish, sushi bar, can get hard to find a table when they're busy."
7/16/2010,4,"Very good and very inexpensive for what you get.Try the 'create-a-don' donburi bowl, for under $10 you'll get quite a bit of sashimi with rice and some associates.  Fish is fresh, service is okay but not terrible, and the frozen yogurt next door also owned by the same folks is always top notch."
9/22/2011,2,Disappointed in the food here...wasn't that good. I've had their katsu bento and sushi...wasn't that good.
5/1/2015,4,"4 Stars!!Although my wife & I like Mama Fu's better, Bento's is a very good alternative!!  The ambiance is nice here, and the food is prepared quick and fresh!!  All their dishes have been very good so far - a real nice treat here is their ""Bento Box"" option - which is a great deal for the money - you just need to be sure you're hungry!!I enjoy coming here whenever I'm in the area and want good food at a good price!!"
5/24/2014,1,"This place is seriously a sad excuse for ""Pan-Asian and Sushi"". Entrees are greasy, lacking flavor and presentation. The sushi is underwhelming.  I'm guessing since the location is in a busy part of the town center, it brings in a lot of traffic. However, it is not difficult to find some authentic and well made Asian food or sushi around here. Better luck trying some other Japanese restaurants around Jacksonville."
9/21/2010,3,"teriyaki chicken was ok.  i've had better.sushi was good.i liked the decor on the inside, a bit loud so it seemed like more fast food ish like."
7/11/2014,2,Don't use the online ordering system!! My total was $30 online but when I showed up they rang me out at $42.  All they could tell me was that the error was a glitch and that they were sorry.  They made no attempt to throw anything in or offer credit back on my card.  Thanks for the deceiving prices and bad customer service!!
4/11/2015,5,"Great place for a Bento fix. They have the usual selections,  I am partial to the Teriyaki."
10/23/2011,4,"Three words: Awesome Coke Machine. They have installed one of those Awesome soda machines that has all the flavors of soda you can imagine. Vanilla Coke Zero, Cherry Coke Zero, Any fruit flavor Fanta: you name it. I love those machines. Before I was on the fence here because the Pad-Thai was ok but since the Coke Machine made its presence I am sold. I like the Korean BBQ on noodles, and they have plenty of options for any Asian food lover. The reason for the 4 stars and not five is I have no idea what has happened to the Boba drinks. I used to always get the chocolate slush with boba beads but the beads now have a strong tea-taste that ruins it. I think they have been soaking them in tea, very disappointing. Still a great eatery I would recommend to anyone, especially with the new soda machine."
10/1/2014,4,"Lunch at the Bento Cafe was very good. Lots of choices. A little confusing at first. I had rice bowl. Veggies were fresh, not frozen. Served hot which is good for me. Nice flavor and portion size was not skimpy. My husband had sushi. Nice sized portion. Good flavors. The ambiance is kind of sterile. They are making something in blenders. Very noisy."
12/29/2014,4,"I'm so glad I decided to check this place out for dinner while at the town center.  Luckily when I arrived they were still doing sushi happy hour, buy 2 rolls get 1 free.  All 3 rolls were delicious,  better than a lot of other places I've tried.  The only downside was paying for the extra sauces (shrimp sauce, spicy mayo etc)  that usually come complimentary at other sushi restaurants. I will definitely be back to try the noodle dishes."
5/16/2017,5,"Bento has the best boba tea in town. I've been here too many times to count and my food has always been good. I love the green beans that come with the bento boxes, but I really come for the tea! Green tea with pearls and mango... do it!!"
12/23/2014,5,"Friendly, patient staff and great food. I had the Mongolian noodle bowl and in my opinion, the Mongolian beef was better than p.f. Changs or pei Wei. And the noodles are amazing. I also had the boba tea and that was also great. If you've never tried boba tea Id recommend it at bento cafe."
2/18/2017,1,"Went on a Thursday night. Pretty full but we found a table. Nice atmosphere for this type of place. We both ordered the same roll, the dynamite. My mate got his right away, it took another 15 minutes for mine to arrive. It was described as ""DYNAMITE tuna, salmon, krab*, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, scallions, masago, spicy mayoIt"". After eating a few slices and wondering where the ingredients were, I decided to open one. There was nothing inside except rice and some krab. Maybe a little cream cheese, maybe a tiny bit of avacado. I put up with ""krab"" these days as no one even here in Florida knows that it is fake. But you did not even put in any of the other ingredients you claimed to be in there. $9 for rice wrapped in seaweed with some sauce?? Will never return."
2/13/2015,5,Awesome place. Atmosphere was very modern and sleek. Was greeted by the server as I walked in to order. Service is fast but went during a lunch rush which was super busy wait for food was slow but understandable. I got the Spicy Cream Chicken it is like Sweet n Sour Chicken but on crack! I can't get enough of it. I recommend getting the Spicy Cream Chicken if you only go there once in your life!!
6/17/2014,4,good fast food.  I have had the sushi and the bento boxes and everything is well detailed.
10/23/2013,5,Tuna Salmon Don Sashimi Bowl is the best!!! As well as a strawberry red tea with Boba pearls :)
6/15/2014,5,"Bento is my absolute favorite go-to for sushi and noodle dishes in Jacksonville. The sushi is always fresh and they put plenty of fish in the rolls. The spicy mayo is delicious. Their rolls are innovative and expertly composed. The hot food is also very well made, and the Bento boxes are a great deal. The udon soup is perfect for when you are feeling a bit under the weather. Although they always have a line, the line moves quickly and I've never had a problem finding a seat."
7/30/2014,3,"Overall this place strikes me as slightly above mediocre - I was pleased by the amount of vegetarian dishes available. Hubby and I came for lunch and were pleasantly surprised the line moved quickly. The place is clean and has a bit of an urban vibe.Now onto the food - I ordered the veggie spring rolls and thai yellow curry veggie bowl with brown rice and tofu. The curry tasted ok (seemed a bit on the flavorless mild side) and the tofu texture was actually pretty good. Brown rice was nicely cooked and the veggies were fresh and crunchy. The bowl was huge - I had enough leftovers to take care of dinner. The spring rolls were probably my favorite part of my meal - hot and crispy accompanied by a nice sweet and sour sauce. Hubby had the Cajun chicken bento box which came with noodles, ginger salad, green beans and white rice. He liked the Cajun chicken and really like the ginger sauce from the salad with his green beans (go figure).  The wait service was passable - u usually had to flag someone to get their attention but everyone was pleasant. Overall this place isn't my first  or last choice for lunch, but I would like to return and taste the sushi. Not a bad selection for quick Asian cuisine."
8/14/2016,2,"This place sucks but the location of this place is what draws people from keeping this place open. When you step in the door you fall in line with roughly 10-15 people ahead of you with only 1 cashier taking orders. After your done with the cashier good luck finding a table since its packed with millenials and teenyboppers hanging around eating with chopsticks actin that this place is authentic and when I got seated, the table keeps wobbling because it's not aligned right. Their milk teas are horrible! Too much syrup or sweetener and the boba pearl is hard to chew and hardly any ice so the drink is not even cold. Their so-called korean bulgogi disappointed me also. I ordered a platter and instead gave me a bowl with the beef that the meat is hard to chew with barely no flavor just spice. Like I said they're lucky they have a good location especially here in Jax where the competition of quality of Asian Restaurants are scarce"
3/1/2015,5,Food is great I love bento box red curryNice ambience and staff is good.Very good place for dinner
4/3/2014,3,"Slightly out of my ideal price range for the food I'm getting, Bento Cafe does delight me with very clean and spacious interior and the staff's ability to (without fail) have a live NBA game on the TV. Because this is an Asian restaurant, in essence, I can't give it more than a three-star rating because of its portion size. The dishes are made for people who weigh less than 165 pounds or people who weigh more than 165 but recently had lap-band surgery. I am a grown man. I can't cheerlead for a place that leaves me hungry 45 minutes after I leave there - especially after I spent $55 there. Despite being tucked in bustling and busy St. Johns Town Center, Bento will continue to pull in business because, in Jacksonville, the trendy and hip thing to do is say you've tried different cuisines. For some reason, a local thinks he or she comes off as more worldly if they've eaten Asian fusion food or something other than a crab boil. I enjoy the intimacy of the place and customizable ""boxes,"" but that's where my admiration ends with Bento."
10/6/2014,5,"Very tasty. I had the korean giogeu (not sure on pronunciation) beef and it was as divine. Fast, fresh, very flavorful and at a fair price."
10/30/2016,3,"Decent sushi. If you're the kind of person that calls ahead or orders online, be aware they frequently forget to put the order in or to check online orders. This has happened to me four times in the last couple months. You'll show up and they've never heard of your order"
12/22/2013,5,This is probably my favorite place in Jacksonville. I have tasted a lot of the items on the menu and they are all delicious. The teas are very good as well. The service is always good.
8/15/2014,5,"I had a great meal here. Its neat that you can order a variety of different things at this restaurant. The food was good and the portions are big, the decor was trendy and cool, and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely come back and try some other menu items!"
4/16/2010,4,"I love Bento.This is my go-to Asian lunch place.  I always order the bulgogi.  It is great and spicy.  To me, everything tastes fresh.  I am not a sushi lover, so I can not judge their sushi, but it does look fresh and well made.  I did not give it 5 stars though because some items on the menue are ""hidden"" nightmares.  Their food is inconsistant because it is either amazing or awful.  ....But the good thing is that about 95% of the menue is awesome.Great asain without the Jacksonville staple ""buffet""."
7/16/2010,1,"I was very dissatisfied with Bento. Even though I am not a vegetarian, I love tofu and I love spicy, so I thought the soy chili would be a good choice. Since we were at Bento Cafe, I wanted to try the Bento Box. Uhhghh, I wish I had went to Panda Express up the street. The tofu they used was terribly soft and the dish, although stated to be ""very spicy"" was insipid. I could not stand the consistency of the tofu, so I sent it back for chicken, which was not much of an upgrade.  The rest of the bento box was a wreck too. The lo-mein noodles were dry, the vegetables were greasy, and the rice was mediocre.I don't think I will be giving Benro Cafe a second chance."
4/21/2013,4,"I love the fact that Bento Cafe has ramen. It's not the same ramen as in NYC and other metropolitan cities, but it's sufficient enough! I was hesitant at first to try out the place only because I figured it was just another fast food Asian fusion restaurant serving the same type of meal. Well I was wrong. I have recently became a fan, and I try to visit it whenever I can. There is just so much options to choose from, and it's seems like it's never ending. Everything I have tried has been great with the exception of the noodles that they serve with the bento box. It was bland. So far my favorite items from Bento cafe is their Tofu Red Curry in rice bowl, Beef Bulgogi in a Bento Box, and their spicy seafood noodle soup. I love how you can choose between the rice plate/bowl, bento box, or noodle (depending on the type of food you have chosen). The bento box actually comes with white rice, ginger salad, string beans, and noodles. Coming to Bento also doesn't break the bank as you get a decent sized portion and nothing is more than $9 per meal. If you are on a budget and craving for some decent asian meal, I recommend coming to Bento Cafe. It's well worth the visit!"
12/19/2015,2,"Being a Bento lover, I go often, maybe every week or two. Today for lunch I got the bento fried rice bowl with chicken, the dynamite #2 and the special Mexican roll. The total ended up being more than $25. I eat the dynamite #2 every time I go in and it is always delicious, it was not as crunchy as usual but still had a good taste. Though, today my rice looked almost white and barely cooked. I understand that everyone tries to have great ticket times but serving food that isn't cooked properly is a big no no. When I informed one of the employees that worked there, they grabbed my bowl of rice (the one I had already had a couple of bites of) and took it back over the sell window and gave it to the kitchen. The kitchen looked at it and then handed it to a different girl who came back to ask what was wrong with the rice. That same bowl of rice was then taken back to the kitchen again for them to try and solve the issue. I was given the same rice again and it tasted as if they had just mixed the rice up with more soy sauce. It was not cooked more or fresh or hot. Honestly, this experience has ruined my love for Bento."
11/1/2013,4,"Huge menu.  I've visited twice and I have enjoyed the sushi, bento boxes and noodle soups.  Both offering more than a one meal portion size.  The sushi is not my favorite in the area, mostly imitation fish and cream cheese based and not very fresh tasting."
7/17/2016,1,"Has a no seat-saving rule, which is not posted anywhere. My wife, 2 month old, and I were going to meet a friend for lunch here and sat down before ordering, only to be rudely told we all had to get up and go through the line before sitting down. Fine, whatever. What made this more of a problem was that at a table toward the front, a lady was very obviously saving the table while the rest of her party ordered. No number or drinks or anything there with her. If you are going to have a rule like that, post it and apply it equally. And definitely be more polite when enforcing it. Will not be back."
11/25/2013,5,Great food for the small place.  My wife and I eat there quite frequently and the food is always top notch.  The service is as good as you can get for the type it offers.
7/2/2011,2,"I really tried to like Bento, but I just can't get into it.  Half of my brother's little Filipina girlfriends work there and it's almost always crowded with obnoxious teenagers and the food is, like, Asian Food for White People, and their salad is a combo of spring mix and iceberg lettuce which is just strange.  *inhales*  Their bulgogi has the consistency and taste of bland beef rendang (gritty and pasty).  The pork katsu tasted oddly sweet and vegetal.  They don't serve enough rice with their bento boxes, the lo mein is greasy, and the boba tea is powdery.  The names of their sushi rolls are amusing, but have little to do with the sushi itself.  For example, two Filipinos such as me and my dining partner are bound to order a kawaii roll called ""The Thrillla in Manila"" which didn't have anything reminiscent of either the Philippines or Muhammad Ali.  And what the f*ck is a kawaii roll?  Rolling it in rice paper and loading it up with lettuce is supposed to make it cute or something?  I would also call Bento out on the misleading descriptions contained within their menu, but the dishes aren't really authentic, so I'll leave that alone.  But, for future reference, describing pancit palabok as ""rice noodles with tasty gravy"" is like describing haggis as ""kind of like meatloaf.""  Real pancit palabok would best be described as ""This is gonna be the fishiest g-damn thing you've ever eaten.  Would like you like hardboiled eggs, chicharron, or both with that?""  On the other hand, you get a lot of relatively palatable food for a reasonable price.  And their Japanese curry reminded me so much of those little squares of Golden Curry my mom used to cook with when we lived in Japan.  I won't dock them any points for the fact that I never really liked Golden Curry, but I can't in good consciousness give them more than 2 stars.And here's a funny story of how rude people can be (which has nothing to do with Bento and did not sway my experience with them, I swear) - my dining companion and I made the mistake of sitting at a table right next to the ordering line.  If you've been to Bento, you know that this first line of tables and the ordering line are separated only slightly by a little half-wall.  An Asian family of 5 was in line and one of the family members came into the table area to reserve a space for the rest of the family.  The family member (let's call her ""Auntie"") then walked up to my immediate right and began a loud conversation with a younger family member (let's call her ""Hello Kitty"") immediately to my left on the other side of the half-wall.  Keep in mind that, not only was the half-wall in between them, but so was I and my little two top - my dining companion had gone to the restroom at this point.  Auntie only spoke their indigenous language (I'm guessing it was Vietnamese?) and, for those of you familiar with most South Asian languages, they are spoken very loudly.  Hello Kitty was speaking just as loudly in English.  So they tossed a few sentences back and forth with each other and then Hello Kitty passed Auntie a menu... over my table... about 5 inches from my face.  Like I wasn't even there."
7/7/2014,4,"Great sushi and bento boxes, love the Mongolian beef box. Reasonably priced for the portions, never leave hungry.  Also try a bubble tea!"
11/23/2014,4,"Great experience. Prices are very reasonable, and the portions are very fair.   Place does get super buys, so service at times can be a bit slow, however understandable when there is a line literally out the door.  Highly recommend."
3/9/2010,4,i think i maaayy be addicted to bento & theres plenty of reasons why. 1. lychee boba aka bubble tea. 2. spicy tuna salad with extra avocado & ginger dressing.3. they have lychee flavored sake. 4. they carry strawberry ramune soda. i can understand WHY this place has horrible reviews though. there are some things on the menu that just ARENT delicious such as the 'spicy cream.' vommmz! steer clear of that one. szechuan chicken is pretty good if you get it as a bento box. you just really have to be careful about what you order or else if can be a baaad trip.
11/16/2009,3,"Standard fare in bento dining.  Also has a fine selection of pan asian cusine that I was impresed with, ranging from Thai dishes to Pho selections.  The sushi menu was extensive and a great deal for the sushi box @ $8.95, which comes with two sushi rolls and a california roll.  The sushi was at the right size, but the fish did not have the overall freshness factor that wowed me in other restaurants.  Great interior decor and lighting.  Great to dine with couples and groups on weekend."
3/14/2014,3,Food is good. Sushi is okay you are better off going somewhere else. Avoid this place during peak hours because it is crowded. Other than that food is hot and good.
9/14/2012,4,"The food in general is good! I don't know if their menu is close to being absolutely authentic, but it's still tasty and worth trying."
3/21/2016,1,I went to this restaurant today and ordered a rice bowl.  All I got was a bowl of rice with a couple of chunks of pineapple.  All the vegetables that were supposed to be in it were not there.  I finally got the attention of one of the waitresses and asked her about it.  She said that they had run out of the vegetables (it was 12:51pm) and hadn't they told me.  I was with my daughter and granddaughter and their entrees had plenty of vegetables.  She offered to bring me something else but my lunch mates were already done.  She knew this as she was picking up the plates while we were having this discussion.  I hardly think that was a suitable remedy.  I won't be back.
12/21/2010,4,"Bento is everything you're looking for in a quick and affordable break from shopping at the Town Center. To be quite honest, I go to the Town Center to eat here more than I go to shop. Some of my favorite SUSHI rolls are: High Roller, Red Dragon, and TNT.Some of my favorite KITCHEN items are: Udon Stir Fry Noodle Bowl (Chicken), Mongolian Noodle Bowl (Chicken), and the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl (Chicken). Their Bento boxes are also delicious, though too much food for me.I am also a fan of their boba teas. Some are a little too sweet for my taste (Strawberry/Honeydew) but they are good nonetheless.The best thing about this place is that it's fast and affordable while delivering food with amazing quality and flavor. The service, while not a ""sit and be waited on"" type of place, is always great and the faces are always smiling and willing to assit you. Now, you'll have to excuse me...I'm heading to Bento thanks to writing this review! (Seriously.)"
4/28/2014,2,"Bento is usually one of my favorite places. I used to go to the Gainesville location years ago and frequently visited the town center location. I was super excited to see them open up so close to work. However, my spicy tuna don was actually a spicy tuna and salmon don. I got takeout so this was a big disappointment. I hope they do better next time."
3/3/2013,5,Love this place. The thai curry is amazing and my son love their pot stickers. Everything is well prices and good portions. Doesn't hurt that they deliver with doorstep delivery either!
9/9/2010,4,"I love Bento!! and for the price it's perfect! the bubble teas are veery sweet and i have a sweet tooth myself but ..hey, maybe the ones i've ordered are sweeter than the rest.  i love their big menu selection of rolls, they're not like the best sushi rolls i've had in my life but i like it a lot and for the price it's even better. they have sushi happy hour M-F 3-6pm buy 2 rolls, get 1 free."
2/13/2013,2,"Not terrible but no point going back.  The food was okay but not a great value.  Small portions for the price, can't even remember anything special about the food.  Didn't love the kind of noisy trendy environment.  Felt like it was trying to be like a Moe's or a deli when you ordered but then like a cafe for seating.  Much better sushi and Asian food on the Southside, especially Crazy Sushi."
11/2/2013,5,Food was delicious. Staff was real friendly and helpful. Service was speedy and attentive. We've been dining here for 3 years and will continue dine with them.
12/10/2009,2,"I went to Bento for the first time on Wednesday at lunch with a friend. I wasn't expecting an order-up kind of place so when we walked in it was pretty crowded. The prices were reasonable for the portion size. The food was decent, typically what I would expect for an upscale fast-food order-up kind of place. My friend had sushi and a salad and she said she liked it. I wasn't very impressed by the looks of the Mexican roll. I had a tofu Bento box with szechuan sauce. The accompaniments were steamed rice, green beans, ginger salad and noodles. My dish was pretty tasty, but definitely nothing to write home about. I think I will go back and try the sushi for a better assessment on the place. Service was excellent! Very friendly staff and very attentive I must say."
2/28/2013,2,"Go elsewhere.this place is mediocre at best.  not the cleanest place.  the sushi is kind of blah.  service is a bit rushed.  i'd suggest wasabi over this place, if you want sushi in the town center."
11/16/2013,4,California roll was fresh. We both had the sweet and sour chicken. My wife in the bento box and I had it with noodles. Very good. The steamed dumplings came out last and were a bit cold. Very busy place. I was caught of guard by the stand in line and pay first way they do business. Overall it was very good.
10/2/2010,4,"Someone recommended Bento to me but I have to admit that I was apprehensive.  I just moved to Jacksonville from the DC area and the food in DC is hard to beat.  There aren't a lot of good Asian restaurants in my opinion.  But we went at my friend's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised.  It's very modern.  We were confused when we walked in because it's not a traditional restaurant.  You order at a counter, they give you a number and bring you your food.  The menu was neat because the entrees are customizable and there's a lot of variety.  It's a neat concept.  The food isn't to die for but it's good for the price and variety.  I'll definitely go back."
7/16/2015,3,I ordered the Florida roll and it good. The bento box I had was good. Not amazing but decent flavor. The prices are reasonable.
10/25/2009,3,Overall good food but too expensive. I love the boboa teas and will be back for those. Space is limited so grab a table as soon as you walk in. This place is definitely going to be one of my splurging venues to visit.
2/6/2013,4,Loved it and can't wait to come back. Unagi roll and shrimp tempura roll are yummy yummy. The fancy drink machine is pretty fun too!
5/28/2012,3,Kind of similar to Crispers...just with Asian food.
9/8/2015,5,Best sushi in town. Volcano roll excellent. Over all most of the rolls are really good. The only thing that I don't like is that you have to order before take a seat. The servers doesn't take orders
11/26/2015,3,"Sushi is ok, the hot food isn't good but we still go here from time to time because it's nearby and like the tuna/salmon dons. Best thing on the menu are the don bowls for sure."
3/10/2013,2,"I was craving sushi like a pregnant woman and I knew there was one in Jacksonville, FL. So I popped in and ordered a mexican roll, tuna tataki and pork dumplings. Ive eaten at the bento in Orlando so I thought this one is just as good. Well.... the mexican roll was blah, the rice was so packed and starchy it was hard to chew it, and the dumplings were gross. There was more  wonton wrapper than there was meat and the sauce was not good. The tuna tataki however was really good! Which was kind of shocking. But I wont go back just for tuna tataki."
8/2/2013,5,"The pork hops are very good. The only problem I had was the portion are not as filling as I thought. It was kind of small, I was still hungry after but it was tasty."
9/14/2012,3,"This place is a very large, fusion style walk up and order and they bring your food sushi/bubble tea/asian food place. The bubble tea is GREAT, the sushi, not so much. The asian food we had (chicken udon) was a-ok. We would return on another visit to Florida to try other menu items."
12/29/2011,4,"This is a pretty good restaurant. You could get the various dishes better in a restaurant that specialized in Japanese or Thai, but this place is still good."
1/2/2010,3,This is a pretty good lunch place.  I'd go back.  My wife and I each had a bento box and we split an order of sushi.  This place is cheap and the food was pretty good.  The staff was also very nice.
2/26/2011,5,"We live in St. Augustine and eat here whenever we have a chance. My husband hated curry until he tried my dish. Sushi is excellent.  Soup is good but will be luke warm unless you ask for it to be served hot. Very reasonably priced. Great atmosphere. Nice outdoor seating when I can convince my Mexican Chihuahua to eat Asian.  Kids get a real ""kick"" out of the cool machine that puts a plastic lid on your soda with Asian cartoon characters.  Cool Yogurt place next door for dessert."
7/29/2012,4,"Great lunch spot - I wish they had more room to sit, but that is a common problem in the area. The bowls of tuna with rice are fantastic. I also like bulgogi and rice."
2/6/2013,4,"I went here for the first time last night and it was pretty good. The set up seems efficient and for being busy, we sure did get our food fast. They have a cucumber avocado roll (best of both worlds, why don't more places do this?) and the veggie with the tofu on top was so good. I'd go back here again when I'm hungrier and try a bento box."
2/26/2011,5,"Great menu choices, fine preparation, and quality ingredients.  This Asian Fusion restaurant would charge a lot more in L.A,."
4/1/2011,4,I have been to one of these in another part of Florida and its a place I know I can go to and get consitently good sushi. They have an interesting menu and nice atmosphere. The sushi tasted very fresh to me.
10/15/2011,3,Nothing I have eaten here is terrible. It's a great place to go while shopping and don't want too much time sitting down for a meal.  It is Asian food for non-Asian food enthusiasts.  Nothing too spicy or pungent.  Great for kids too.
8/7/2013,5,"Our go-to place for fast, cheap, and last but certainly not least, GREAT sushi. Their sushi happy hour is awesome, so get your order in before 6!I recommend the spicy tuna don."
8/11/2011,1,"Walked in and looked at the menu.  Found something I wanted, but I wanted pork. For some reason they just could not make it w pork.  Didn't even bother eating. I work in a restaurant that bends over backwards to give whatever the customer wants, and they can't even make a simple substitution.  Won't get my business."
7/22/2012,4,"Modern, quick, and tasty! Good tofu. If eating clean ask for sauce on the side and order brown rice :p fresh veggies"
2/6/2013,5,Always a great experience at Bento. Love the Sushi happy hour and the coke freestyle machine.
4/16/2015,4,Great Japanese food with unique sushi rolls.  Never had a bad meal here.
7/7/2014,4,wanted some sushi so got online which is awesome and ordered up some sushi.. have never got sushi from this location but have from there other location and was always satisfied. . Got a good variety of rolls and everything was prepared very well and the taste was very good..would not hesitate to order again.
3/30/2015,5,Best sushi in Jacksonville. I love  the Mt Fuji roll and the bento boxes are great. We go at least once a week for lunch if possible
9/21/2010,4,"Compared to the numerous sushi restaurants around the Jacksonville area, this is a place I don't mind to frequent (for a place so rich in seafood, so many sushi shops in Jax just fall so short of quality sushi). I tried the TNT, dynamite, and spicy salmon roll most recently. All rolls came stuffed with generous whole pieces of fish. There was no overbearing amount of rice in/on the rolls that took away from the flavor or acted as filler to make the roll seem big. The best part of the spicy salmon was that it was actually SPICY without being slathered in spicy mayo. I barely used the soy sauce simply because I didn't want to detract from the taste of the sushi. I don't recall many or maybe any of the 'premium' rolls exceeding $10 and many included 10 pieces. I also got a mango milk tea with boba. Milk tea was a bit more creamy than expected and would have preferred a bit more mango but every place has a different way of doing boba tea. Either way, 4 stars for the great sushi."
2/27/2012,5,Total fan! Can't get enough. Great food and good service.
5/24/2012,5,Love the food and the tea.
8/5/2012,3,"For quick and dirty, it's pretty darn good. It's entirely unfair to compare Bento to a ""real"" sushi bar, or Korean BBQ, or anything else specializing in a more high-end version of a specific product, because Bento doesn't pretend to be any of that. It's kind of like the Pan-Asian Five Guys, so adjust your expectations accordingly. I wouldn't compare Five Guys to Holeman & Finch but I'm not going to stop eating it, either.The decor is clean and modern but it is NOISY - too many hard surfaces. I have a love/hate relationship with the drink machine because it is super fun but (a) it's always out of something that I want, and (b) everybody wants to play with it and/or slow folks just don't understand it, so there's frequently a line to get my beverage. If you are looking for something unusual, or a diet something besides Coke, you will be pleased. I've had the spicy tuna salad several times and I'm generally happy with it. The tuna is occasionally tougher than I would like, but not enough to make me angry. I would love a lettuce besides iceberg but that is what it is. The conch salad I wouldn't do again - tough and chewy and generally not at all what a lovely fresh conch should be. My chopsticks have wandered into a nearby chicken teriyaki noodle bowl once or twice and that seems pretty good, and the Bento boxes look lovely, though I've never been quick enough to snag anything off of that particular friend's plate. For a place to pop in while shopping, it'll do the job nicely - a head and shoulders above the ""food court"" Asian joints. It's a bit overpriced and you might have to wait for a seat if you go during peak times, but for a late lunch in a reasonable hurry it's a go-to for me. And on either Mondays or Tuesdays (one or the other - can't remember which), bring your receipt to Mochi's next door and get $1 off your fro-yo. Win!"
9/7/2011,1,I really liked this place and ate here a couple of times. Then I found hair in my food and got grossed out and have not been back. You might like it..... I dont think I will go back though.
2/29/2012,5,"Taro Milk Tea with Boba. Bestest. Ever. Nice, chill place to be at, too. Definitely will be going back at least every other day!"
8/6/2016,1,I don't normally give reviews but my experience at this place is horrible!!! The staff is so rude and need to learn how to have costumer service.  While I was waiting for me husband to order our food and so I went ahead and take a seat because we have young children but was told that I can't sit at a table unless we are done ordering when my husband was the third person in line which makes no sense at all. Either way we are paying to eat there and what's the big deal when there are tons of other seats available to everyone else.  If this is your rule then posted a sign in the front to notify everyone and also ask politely. I will not recommend any of my friends or family to tried out this place because it will just ruined your whole mood and the food is okay compare to others places that I have tried in Jax.  I will not be returning.  They need a better management personnel and some who cares to run a business and costumers service. It doesn't matter if you have good food but lack of customer service will drive people away. No food is good enough to be disrespected.
4/12/2016,1,food is ok. price is average but food turn out minimum. 1/2 rice/noodles in a bowl. well! u pay $10 for 1/2 bowl of noodles
12/14/2013,1,"I've been eating here since they opened. It was pretty good then but has been going downhill since. The portions are getting small. It has become dirty. The floor always has food and trash on it. Food is inconsistent,  especially the sushi rice is hit or miss. Today I gave it another try...there was hair and food and grease on the couch seat. Staff was no help in ordering for my wife who is gluten free. Bathroom is dirty always. Only one cash register open always when there's a lot of people working and line out the door for no reason.  My salmon don had lots of rice with very little chopped salmon in it. Very poor quality salmon, seemed like the leftovers. hardly worth the cost. Chkn teriyaki was dry and burnt......and we had three orders of it. I keep going back hoping things have changed and they keep getting worse. Like someone else who commented earlier, I have been to the Bento in Orlando on Sand Lake and it was great. This looks like a case of owner neglect or a struggling business cutting corners to save money."
1/30/2014,5,"I have tried many different Chinese (really, Americanized Chinese) restaurants, but Bento is one of the best I've ever been to!  The food was prepared relatively quickly (surely no McDonald's, but for the quality: the food was in front of me quickly).  The portions are great.  The menu set up is easy to understand; first you pick what kind of meal you want (the Bento box has more variety of food, but the rice bowl is more simple for those searching for more a more American-Chinese food experience), then you pick your meat (chicken, steak, tofu, pork).  I have been to this restaurant many times and never been disappointed with the food.Also, There is a sushi bar where you can actually watch a line of workers prepare sushi roll after sushi roll, keeps the kids (or you) entertained while waiting for food for a couple minutes.Also, the prices are very good too! $7.25 for a rice bowl which is enough of a meal for two!"
1/16/2010,1,Did not like.  Was very dissapointed sweet and sour chicken was soggy and drowning in bland sauce.
5/18/2014,1,"The first time here I was so excited!  The food was very good except that I couldn't get them to serve me a cup of hot green tea.  The first time they brought it, the tea was barely warm - I asked them to heat it up and it came back barely warmer.  The second and third visits were just frustrating.  I got barely warm soup and my mother tried to order a noodle dish she got the first time, ""Seafood Udon"" and they brought something out totally off the wall. We tried to tell the waitress 3 times it was the wrong dish, and she kept saying ""Oh, I'm just not saying it correctly"".  Finally, she took the soup back and it took 30 minutes for them to bring the correct dish. Today, we went there again, and again my mother ordered the ""Seafood Udon"" and we got something else.  I am done with this place.  Things you won't get here:  hot tea, hot soup or the entrée.  Also, no sweetener for those who like to get unsweetened tea and add it."
3/22/2011,4,"I am a fan.I eat here at least once a week, and I admit, it is more for the ambience than the food, but I have some favorites.  In the winter, I usually have the spicy seafood soup (thin noodles), but lately, I have been having the spicy korean beef bento box (I agree with other yelpers that it has far too many onions).  I also concur with most yelpers that the sushi is pretty average, but I am just happy Jacksonville finally has a place like this.  After living in cities like DC, Seattle, NY ...this reminds of the places I used to frequent when I was in college.  My kids love the stir fried udon, and my parents always find something they like (it is difficult to find a place that will please the palate of ""old school"" Asian grandparents, my husband and I and the kids!) .  A bit much to charge for ""extra sauces"", so we always decline these and use the soy or sriracha on the tables.   We all are glad to have boba tea (green tea lychee is my fave).  Service is fast and friendly.  When I am there, the sushi chef or the servers always stop by to ask me how I am doing or if I need anything.  We always head next door to mochi for dessert.  We try to go at ""non-peak"" times, which is a lot more pleasant because it tends to get crowded .  Kudos for nice outdoor seating, too.  A bit pricy for what you get, but as one yelper stated, it would be double the price in a city like LA or NYC for the same thing.  You can get out for under $10.00 for lunch.We go to Gainesville relatively frequently, and we eat at the Bento Cafe there, as well.  It is consistent in food quality and service also. Just the type of place I like to patronize regularly.  Modern, clean and cool atmosphere.  I would have liked it when I was in college, and I like it still now.  My kids always request it.  We count ourselves as fans."
3/19/2014,3,"The fish was fresh and tasted good. The pieces are small and cut very thin.  What I did not like is that you have to order before you sit down.  I understand the concept but having never been here before and the fact that they have 2 sizable menus makes it pretty ridiculous especially when the lighting did not make it easy to read and with people waiting behind you,  I never really got a good look at the menu and just ordered some of my standards.  They miss the mark on the concept with the size of the menu and the being  sort of forced to order before you are ready, also it is kind of  a wannabe hipster Sushi joint and they did not pull that off, but think it may have just opened so may get better.  That being said look at the menu online before you go.  I would probably have rated it higher if I would have had more of a chance to go over the menu and if the pieces would have been larger because it did taste fresh and was quality food but what I ordered was not worth the price, but you could eat here for less and get more if you know what to order."
3/5/2022,5,The food was absolutely delicious! First time eating there. I'll go again though! My order was a take-out and it was packaged very well. I'm very impressed.
8/8/2021,5,"So glad they've finally opened at the beach!  I've frequented other locations for years. Great option for something quick and healthy, and the sushi is always fresh. Highly recommend."
2/22/2022,4,I ordered take out from this spot last night and overall I was pleased. I called them to ask a few questions and make sure I could get my food with some modifications. The lady who answered was really nice and helpful. I had the stir fry veggie bento minus the onion and with the sweet soy sauce. I also had an order of the veggie spring rolls with the sweet chili sauce. Everything was quite tasty and the portion was large enough for two meals. It is fast casual so not my kind of place to dine in but their menu has lots of options and it seemed very clean. I will get take out again.
12/8/2022,1,Bad experience here. Staff could care less about being helpful. Looking at the food line they had stuff piled everywhere and looked very disorganized and unsanitary. This is a very weak attempt at fast casual  sushi and Asian food.
7/30/2021,5,I have been to Bento Asian Kitchen located at the town center a couple of times. I was in the Jax beach area this afternoon and decided to stop and grab lunch. If you've never had Bento I highly suggest getting the pao pao chicken. The flavor is very unique and unlike any other I have ever tasted. It's addicting! The white rice is super delicious as well. The serving size is more than enough for lunch and dinner. I also find that the rice bowls are very reasonably priced starting as low as $11. The inside of this location is very clean so I was super impressed with that. Great job Bento!
5/25/2022,4,Really nice ambiance and very clean. The sushi was way better than a lot of finer sushi houses. Had noodle and rice bowls. Generous servings and quite tasty.
12/4/2021,1,"If you're interested in distinctly mediocre pan-Asian menu with pretend sushi and plastic-textured over cooked stir-fry then you're in for a treat. If you like your food good and your front of house knowledgeable about the menu - then steer clear.  On the plus side, the place is clean and the young staff seem nice. Clearly it's poor management."
1/11/2022,3,"This bento is just like the other two in town. Food is descent, have been here a few visits and they really load up on rice on all rice dishes. This includes poke and sushi, where one would think it was a bit less. The edamame's are a family favorite though. All the garlic, yum. Service is good and quick just as the others. Bento is more expensive than other sushi places at the beach, or in general. Sushi rolls are on the more expensive side to be so small and tons of rice. However, we will still return as they are conveniently located to us and fast."
8/25/2021,4,Came here 30 minutes before closing after moving my daughter from New Orleans. The staff was friendly and quick with my order given I was this tired and hungry person coming in before they closed. Sushi was good but a bit more rice than my liking and great steamed dumplings. Great service and friendly staff.
1/2/2022,5,Very good! and the son is very friendly and thr food was good with generous portions! I will come back when visiting Jacksonville
10/1/2021,1,The food isn't take good. Bad service. Shushi is all rice over .need to make it better. Wasn't happy first visit.
3/14/2022,1,"Food was terrible tasteless unless you drown it in sauce, they give you a small amount of protein for the normal amount, missing a lot of inventory ... the employees are unmotivated and sluggish."
9/27/2022,5,SOOOOO GOOOODDD!!! Super cute location & great staff! Food came quick and tasted great
7/26/2022,2,"Friendly staff and clean restaurant, but the food was unremarkable. My wife got a bento box with sautéed vegetables and I got a salmon roll and miso soup. My sushi was a bit subpar. The rice was too vinegary and the salmon, which seemed OK, had a very pale orange color to it which made me question the quality. My wife hated her bento box. The vegetables were freshly cooked but the sauce was gloppy and one dimensional. The rest of the box was unremarkable; lukewarm noodles and rice, a basic salad and some green beans. It was certainly a big portion, but it wasn't very good. We both commented how much of a shame it was that the food wasn't better. We love Park Place and eat Asian food quite often. I would come here all the time if it was good. Unfortunately, it wasn't."
12/2/2022,5,I'm originally from New York and consider myself a foodie and a tough critic. Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi in Boca Raton exceeded my expectations. My food arrived much sooner than expected and warm.  My fried dumplings were crispy and the size of the bento box surprised me. Everything was delicious and amazing. The cherry on top had to be the little crunchy wonton crisps in their own little compartment. They were dusted w/ cinnamon and sugar and served as a great little dessert. I will definitely be ordering from them again very soon.
11/28/2022,2,"Food is decent but prices and portions do NOT correlate. I've been eating here for years and it used to be so much cheaper and you would get a decent sized portion. Went today after not going for awhile, paid 18 dollars for a poke bowl just for it be half the size of the actual bowl itself.  If I am paying almost 20 dollars for a bowl I at least expect to get a substantial amount of rice. Very disappointing, the tofu tasted pretty bad and like it's been sitting out all day and dry. Can definitely say I'm not returning here. Very sad as I used to love this place and always ate here."
8/12/2021,4,"In the mood for Asian food, I remembered my friend's suggestion to try Bento. The day came to give it a try! I walked in and place a to go order since I had limited time for lunch. The service was great, I was helped almost immediately and it didn't take too long to get my food to go. I ordered a ""spicy"" fried rice with tofu. I said ""spicy"" in quotation marks because it wasn't spicy at all. Either way it tasted delicious! It had a very pad Thai type of taste, I suspect they cook with peanut oil. It was more in the sweet side. I liked a lot even though it wasn't spicy. I also ordered boba tea. I chose a passion fruit flavor which had a green tea based with lychee pearls. It was way too sweet to my taste, but after adding a little bit of water it became perfect. I'm giving this place 4 stars because of those little details that could make it more authentic perhaps or improve. I still recommend it as a good lunch spot. The food was very tasty even if they don't hit the spicy note!"
7/19/2022,4,If your looking for affordable extra filling lunch this is it. Don't let the size mislead you. It's very yummy
10/24/2021,4,"To-go sushi, poke, and hot Asian food style restaurant. I ordered the taro milk tea with honey boba. The boba was perfectly cooked but I found the milk tea itself to be overly sweet and taste more like a milkshake. My boyfriend and I both ordered regular build your own poke bowls and honestly the bowls they serve you have so much food in them and going forward we will most definitely split one. I thought the fish portions were really generous and tasted fresh. I did find the sushi rice to be really mushy and over cooked but other than that I was pretty impressed. I would definitely go back when I'm looking for a quick dining experience."
2/13/2021,4,"3 1/2 stars. A good lunch with huge portions.  I'm a fan of bento boxes. Compartments with little bits of different foods to mix and match. Only in this case, it was large amounts different foods. You choose your meat (or tofu or shrimp) and your sauce plus white or brown rice. Each box comes with sauteed green string beans, a crisp salad with ginger dressing, and warm low mein noodles. In the middle of the box was a ""dessert"" - - crispy fried noodles with sugar and cinnamon on them. My choice of main dish was the chicken with yellow curry. It was very aromatic and had a very slight kick. In addition to copious amounts of white meat chicken breast, were carrots, green beans, zucchini, and bell peppers. It was very tasty. My husband ordered their sushi combo box. It included  an 8 piece California roll, plus his choice of two of their 4-piece classic sushi rolls. There were over a dozen choices. He also had a smaller portion of salad and some cold veggie (zucchini) topped with a miso dressing. in the box. His combo was a very large portion for the price ($12). If you don't want a large meal, they have build your own poke bowls; signature and classic sushi rolls, rice and noodle.bowls. They also have build your own boba teas/drinks. And they even have a kids meal. They were quite busy during lunch. Lots of college kids and business people in the area plus you can order and pay online. Then pickup. There is inside seating and a patio area outside, too. You order and pay at the counter and are given a number to display on your table. They deliver your meal to you. I wasn't familiar with this chain. Thank you to Howard H., fellow yelper elite, for eating here and intriguing me with his review to bookmark this location. It was a very good experience."
8/6/2022,2,"Ordered take out/ with me picking it up.  Service was slow getting checked out and food was over cooked and not that good.  I would give them a 2nd chance, not sure when."
3/4/2022,4,"Torn between 3 and 4 stars. Food was good and nicely plated! My sushi were way too salted for some reason though. My fiancé really liked his chicken. As for negatives, we had to wait for a long time for our food although it was not busy. And the prices are insanely high for what you get. The restaurant is nice and clean inside though and has a nice patio seating. Overall it was a nice lunch but we will probably not return."
2/19/2022,5,"Fresh delicious food, clean place, friendly staff. They have a hand washing station! But my favorite thing is the food."
8/19/2021,4,I just love my poké bowl full of salmon and full of sauces and fruits. They fulfilled that craving of mine without me asking. They also satisfied one of the most important aspects of a poké bowl: good and generous portion. They left me with a full stomach and a subsequent and much needed food coma. Will be coming back and try out other items on the menu for sure.
8/6/2022,1,"The food and menu looks good but don't be fooled! I got a sushi order with the scallops and was up all night vomiting. (I was unhappy with myself for ordering scallops in a place like that and thought It was my own bad decision and a fluke). But then, a few weeks later, my daughter got chicken chow mein and was up all night vomiting. Health department needs to look into this place. Will never go back."
6/23/2021,3,Bento box with chicken red curry was OK!Having rice and noodles in the same box is a bit of a mistake but the curry was super spicy and had a generous amount of chicken (too much carrot). Udon noodle bowl with tofu and broccoli was over cooked and barely edible.  I feel that it's possible to order better food with a knowledge of what's good on the menu. If you are either smart or lucky it's a cheap meal with a lot of choices.
1/9/2022,5,I've eaten here before and the food is great but my customer service experience was great.  I made a mistake in my order and they fixed it for me with a smile even though I know it could've been a pain in the butt. Great service goes a long way.  Thank you Bento!!! I will be back!!!
9/17/2022,5,Awesome family deal!   Healthy and great family will love it!  Katsu chicken is our favorite
12/30/2019,3,"This is a good place for lunch. You can make your own bento bowl, salad or get sushi! As wellas Bobo tea! You go up to the cashier to place your order and they give you a number for your table and you sit down and they bring it to you. Very casual but very good. It's good for all ages as well. It's in the same strip mall as Yoke, Prezzos and Burton's. It is reasonably priced so tang is nice. I just wish they would do an app and a loyalty program. That would make it even better."
12/22/2019,4,"I'm stopped in here for dinner after leaving the nearby CycleBar class. On Friday night, the restaurant was moderately busy, with many people placing To-Go orders.  I love the build your own bowl options, but I opted for the Hawaiian Poke Bowl, with half rice and half salad. The portion was quite large, and everything was fresh and tasty. Overall, I think it's a nice place for a quick lunch or dinner, and I love that there are some healthy options."
11/30/2019,5,"Came here a while back for lunch with a few coworkers.  This place is located in a busy plaza with different restaurants.  The original plan is to come by around 11:30am, but when by the time we arrived around noon, the line was all the way from inside the restaurant to the street.But I think it's worth the wait.  It could take an average dinner to go through their menus as they all sorts of different items from ramen, shsui to lunch bentos (duh...).  Not sure if there was a vegetarian option, but there rarely are in Asian restaurants.I decided to go with their chicken katsu, or fried pork chop.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful while the outside was crispy.  I also love their rice, it might sound simple but its not easy to make it hot, moist and fluffy.Overall it was a good, quick lunch option.  Everyone at the lunch enjoyed their food.  The staff was friendly and the line moving pretty quick while turning a lot of tables.  I'd definitely go back but may wanted to get there a bit earlier next time."
1/20/2021,5,"Whoops, I was too hungry to take a picture before I ate but it was delicious. Had a make your own poke bowl tonight and split a volcano roll. They had prepackaged utensils and sauces safely packaged. Would recommend the poke bowls."
12/7/2021,1,The food is mediocre at best but now they went cashless so don't bother trying to come here unless you have a credit card I guess they discriminate against people who can't have credit cards or bank accounts
12/7/2021,1,I sent my son here because he didn't want fresh kitchen. They refused cash payment. Cash is legal tender in this country & I feel this is discrimination..what about people who work for cash tips? Also what about people with bad credit who don't have a credit card? Shameful in this day & age..will never go here again & will let everyone we know not to go here
8/29/2019,4,"We have been to the Bento location in Davie maaaaany times while living out there and were always a fan, so we were happy to go here while house hunting in the Boca area. Bento is fast casual Asian food and has something for just about everyone which makes it an easy place to pick when you're in one of your ""I don't know what I want to eat"" moods.Both times we went they had signs they were still in their soft opening. serbice the second time was a little slower than our first which was interesting. I work in the area and although I haven't been during lunch rush I'd recommend calling/ordering ahead to make things easier. As for the food, 9 out of 10 times I pick a build your own poke bowl since it's fully customizable. You can pick rice (brown or white) or mixed greens for your base. Then you select your proteins, veggies (avocado isn't extra!), add-ons (think sesame seeds, cream cheese, etc) and your sauce. Meanwhile my husband sticks to their TNT roll - he likes how the fish on top is ""flamed"". But another reason I'm a fan of Bento is because they have boba tea! Getting boba in South FL is no easy feat so I can appreciate when it is offered. (But just a note - I'm no expert or purist on the boba tea topic but it tastes good and that's all I care about.)Hopefully service can be streamlined a bit more and it would be cool if they brought in a Freestyle Coke machine like their Davie location ;-)"
4/8/2022,1,"""Bento box"" more like shit box. Ordered the teriyaki chicken, was not cooked and no sauce. Rice was not cooked at all! Any Asian cuisine that can't cook teriyaki chicken shows a lot about the place."
4/3/2022,1,If I could leave zero stars I would.  It's been a while since I've eaten anything so disgusting. Drenched with sauce and no flavor. The Edamame was barley tolerable. Save your money.
2/12/2021,4,"Dine In is now open!Plenty of Inside and outside seating available.This new Asian food eatery has plenty of options for Sushi - Bento - Bowl creations and you will leave full and satisfied!Today for lunch I chose one of the Sushi Boxes: 8 pieces of California roll, I chose the Special Mexican roll and Florida roll to round out my order.The Special Mexican roll had Shrimp tempura, steamed shrimp, avocado,  masago, spicy mayo, cream cheese and eel sauce. The Florida roll had tuna, salmon, cucumber, cream cheese and masago. The box also had cubed zucchini and a nice salad. The California roll was good too, and with the eight pieces of California roll to go along with the four Special Mexican and four Florida roll pieces, was a lot of food!The staff is friendly and if you dine inside they give you a  numbered flag for delivery to your table when your order is ready.They do have bottled beers, cans of hard seltzer, bottled water, juices and sodas. (The fountain drinks machine was not in operation this visit so we shared a canned soft drink).There is a condiments counter where you can gather soy packets, (regular or low sodium), chopsticks,  straws, napkins, take out boxes, salt and pepper This place also looks to be popular with the young college/university set in the area. When you are hungry, lunch or dinner, this is definitely the place to come!"
2/2/2020,3,"Ordering was a bit confusing at the register since it was our first visit.  We ordered Chicken Padthai and a Poke bowl.  For a drink, we ordered a Boba Tea with popping bobas.  The drink was great.  Poke Bowl was a bit on the salty side, but plenty of fish.  The Padthai was too spicy.  Not quite the right place for us, but good to try."
3/6/2021,5,"On this particular Friday night we didn't intend on going to Bento Asian kitchen but we were so happy we did!  This restaurant is located in a strip plaza on Military Trail just north of Yamato.  This is a quick service restaurant, you walk up to the counter and order, they give you a number and they bring the food to you.  My wife and I both got bento boxes for dinner, I got the general tso's chicken and she got a garlic chicken.  We really didn't know what to expect but these ""boxes"" were huge!  They come with noodles a choice of white or brown rice and a salad. They also have different types of sushi and boba teas.  We both got the Thai Tea boba tea and for 24oz it was $5.50.  For the kids we got them the kids meals which were also quite large.  They both enjoyed their food and finished it all.  We will definitely go back!!!"
1/12/2021,5,"Super fresh, super clean and an extra nice staff who are very accommodating and always properly masked! Everything we've had here has been excellent. I'm someone that will only eat Sushi at spots that are extremely fresh and this is. Some of the things I really like about eating here and makes me recommend it is that they have something for any time of day. Wether its a quick snack of edamame, dumplings or a 4pc sushi roll, a lighter meal of one of their mini-Poke bowls or a full combination Bento Box with sushi, a hot entree & side, this a great spot any time of day. Their Milk Teas with or without Boba are also an excellent sweet treat. I also like that for a casual dining place they have a fairly extensive menu and their protein selection is excellent. I don't remember them all but there are 5 different Salmon choices (Regular, smoked, Poke marinated, Spicy & Teriyaki) Tuna, Yellow Tail, Krab, Egg, Tofu and more. Everything we have eaten here so far, we would have again. We catered a small party of 8 on New Year's Eve from here and everyone raved about it. So if you're looking for something different or something new, I highly recommend trying Bento."
5/14/2022,5,"I've had complaints in the past, but this place really has it together. Good luck picking something on the menu, because it's all good. You have a tough choice there, but I recommend the yellow curry rice bowl."
2/18/2021,5,"Disclosure: I'm Asian so I'm picky AF when it comes to Asian food.  For lunch I ordered the chicken pad Thai and it was so yummy.  A bonus is that, with tax it was under $10 (cheaper than the menu pictures on Yelp).  The food took about 5 minutes to make and the portions were huge; about 40% bigger than I probably needed as a grown man.  I can't wait to come back and try other menu items."
10/8/2019,4,"Came by yesterday for lunch with Orphan George and Orphan Rick after hearing that this place opened up in Boca from my boys as we had been to a similar one in Davie FL.I was quite excited to hear it was local and upon entering we found it very well lit and decor was nice and modern.When you enter you pick up a menu that is extensive and can be a bit confusing but for the first timers I would highly recommend the Bento Box as a starter which has a white or brown rice, green beans, a salad with ginger dressing, crispy fried triangles lol and noodles as your base, then you order your main course and it is added to the box and that way you get to flavor a little of everything.George ordered the Sesame Chicken, Rick had the Gen Tso's chicken and I had the Katsu Chicken with the yellow curry sauce (served separately) and all our meals were delicious.  Soft drinks are available on tap and refills are free (they could however do with a bit better variety)!All in all we had a very good meal and decently priced even though it was in ""the Boca"".  I would definitely give this place a thumb's up for my fellow Yelpers and will definitely be back with the rest of the Orphans and the family."
3/8/2021,4,"There is indoor dining and the place is really neat. The food here is pretty good for its price. It's not exactly the tastiest asian food i've had but it's not bad either. I do like their chicken with rice or noodles a lot better than their sushi. I feel like it's better ""quality"". I am a really big fan of their milk tea. I really like the strawberry flavor with strawberry boba."
4/20/2021,5,"This food taste amazing! Establishment is very clean, well mannered employees and again, the food was amazing. I had a poke bowl, made with love! Will always order when in town!"
7/2/2020,5,We went here because we were craving Asian food and our favorite place had closed. We got the Orange bento box and sesame chicken stir fry. Both were amazing and the strawberry soda was very different. It's different because there's a marble that you push out the cap that's in the drink. Overall very good food and would definitely go back.
11/19/2019,3,Decided to try something new so we came here. Atmosphere is very nice and everything was very clean.  While ordering we were a little confused how to order and got really not directions on how to. We order the kids meal for my daughter and she loved it! I got a bento box which I loved also. I also got a honey boba tea. My drink didn't come out until I actually went back up to the cashier to get it (which was sitting on the counter for how ever long). I was a little upset because I asked the waiter where the drink was and he told me he would go find out. We had already finished the meal before we got it. The drink was definitely a green tea but the cashier insisted that it was honey dew. They offered to make a new one but I didn't want to wait any longer. We left it there. Food was great but I think the staff needed a little more training and better customer service.
5/20/2021,1,"They give you enough food, unfortunately the boba tea tastes horrible. The noodles remind me of linguini noodles and tasted nasty. The Korean salad was far from a Korean salad. The main course in the box (Korean) was decent. Sadly I won't be coming back. For the price it was a big disappointment."
7/4/2021,1,"Unorganized and unprofessional staff. Waited 30 minutes for my food when my last 15 minutes I was the only customer in the store. No one came to explain why it was taking so long it just seemed like the norm. No explanation upon request for refund either. The management in the store at this time should be switched or I'm not sure how this place will stay open. The foods not even all that good, I just went cos it was one of 2 restaurants open in the area on the holiday."
9/12/2019,5,"This is brand new at this location. I LOVE this place. (Mom and I ate at the one in Tallahassee)The food is fresh and plentiful.  Staff was very nice, and food came out fast and hot. It takes a while to place your order, because if you haven't eaten there before, the person at the register has to explain to you how it's done. The food I'd NOT over salted."
4/11/2020,5,I ordered a delivery and I was surprised how quickly the order arrived and still warm.The udon soup was delicious and the teriyaki rice also delicious both a large serving. We also had spring rolls which were crispy but not greasy.Door dash is the only way I would order.
8/23/2020,1,"Oufff, first time ever ordering from Bento and this is what I see when I'm pretty much done with it, eww, where is the quality control, not just 1 but 2 items that shouldn't be in my food. 1 white string and 1 long piece of plastic. Grossed out, the food was good but this unacceptable."
3/10/2021,5,"Ordered take out for lunch a few times. Tried their Mongolian beef with rice , pad Thai and coconut curry. I liked all of those dishes. I was surprised how good they were. I have yet to try the sushi but I think this is an amazing place to have lunch."
3/7/2021,3,"I have a sweet spot for Bento from going here weekly in college. But this location is very hit or miss for me. The food is inconsistent. Sometimes prepared differently or with substituted ingredients. For takeout, the wait times are never accurate. It's been a year into this pandemic and their soda fountain is still not open? So you're forced to buy a water bottle for 25 cents. My meal is typically very dry so I get stuck buying an extra sauce for 50 cents. I'll still keep coming here occasionally but it's definitely not as good as I remember or want it to be. Fun fact: each entree comes with a free sauce, it's not advertised at all but it does."
11/19/2019,5,"So happy that Bento finally opened a location in the Boca area. I can now get my fix in of Pao Pao Chicken (Spicy Cream) without having to drive to Davie. Been to this location multiple times already and couldn't be more pleased. Super consistent, fast and tasty every time!"
10/5/2019,4,"I don't venture this far often but I got a reason to now! I had a mixed greens poke bowl with spicy tuna and Asian Cajun steak. I added asparagus, jalapeños, cream cheese, mango, and avocado. Then I topped it with fried garlic and pickled ginger. Lastly I added yuzu ponzu. I have not been that quite eating a ""salad"" in a long time. It was truly delicious. One thing I really loved about the restaurant was the hand washing station. Having a wild boy it's always great to have a spot to wash his hands quickly because I never know what he has touched or played with. However, the staff was unwilling to let me sample the sauces while ordering my food or my sons. And the dish that children's meals are served in slip and slide all over the table. I had to really make sure he did not accidentally knock it off the table."
6/14/2021,5,One of my favorite spots when I'm around the Boca area. Food is always fresh and place is always clean.
6/10/2021,2,The food is pretty good but with recent price hikes I don't think it's worth it is now almost 17 dollars for a full meal without a drink. There portions also seem to be smaller. The staff there is nice and helpful but it's not a reasonable value for the new pricing.
3/3/2020,5,"I have not been WOWED by a restaurant in a while, but Bento wowed me! The food was absolutely amazing. The Mongolian Beef Bento Box is my new jam! Everything on the plate was fantastic! The quality is great, portions are perfect and the service is quick! Love love love it!!"
9/8/2019,5,"I've been to a few locations in Orlando and absolutely love Bento! Food is decently priced, efficient  and it's in a great location in park plaza. This will definitely become a favorite for the Boca community. The restaurant is modern with plenty of inside and outside seating. When you walk in you see a menu and wait in line to order at the counter. They give you a number so the staff can bring out your meal. Their menu includes sushi, poke bowls, combo boxes and on the other side of the menu sides, soups, noodle or rice bowls, boba teas. It looks like they will have a selection of beer coming soon! I'm so excited for Bento to be opening more locations here in south florida. I usually always get the sushi combo box but now that it is closer to home, I can try more menu items."
2/1/2021,4,"The pao pao shrimp/chicken is great 85% of the time. The lost star is for the inconsistency. But when it's good, it's really good."
5/30/2020,4,Good clean fresh fish.  Rice was perfect.Smaller portion size - not fat guy compatible.
10/22/2020,1,"I placed an online order, arrived 10 minutes earlier than the estimated time and was told that the order was not ready and it should be a few minutes.  Waited 20 minutes and out of frustration asked again how much longer only to find out my order was there waiting the whole time. This was my first time visiting and my meal is cold and soggy. With an empty restaurant and full staff I would expect better service."
8/29/2019,4,"Now that my local Pei Wei has been replaced I had to go search for another Asian to go restaurant as my go to. You walk up and pick a base with a protein and a style (ie curry, teriyaki, general Tao etc). I opted for the bento box (it's called bento for a reason I guess?) with chicken and yellow curry. I noticed they had boba tea and as a boba tea lover I had to try one. Matcha with boba it is! The wait was quick only about 10 mins or so, the staff was less enthusiastic however it was not rush time so I don't really blame them, kinda boring. Upon sitting down a worker came up to me and told me they ran out of boba, bummer..I ordered the popping boba (lychee) instead with a matcha milk tea. Overall everything was good nothing spectacular but at the price range I can't really complain, most likely I'll visit them again..maybe for a poke bowl? Or sushi!"
8/20/2021,5,"Delicious food. I always go to the breakfast place right next to this place and whenever I passed it I always wanted to try. So glad I did. I love Asian food and making my own bento boxes. It was super convenient and the food tasted real good. The price is great too, a lot cheaper than I thought it would be."
9/15/2019,4,"Nice selection of preconfigured ""from the kitchen"" items or build your own bowl. Boba tea choices were real as well.Will definitely be back!"
10/23/2020,4,Neat small chain with very good menu. Have been picking up in Boca for lunch and the rice and noodle bowls are very tasty. Bento box a plus. Sushi and rolls and also good value and portion.
7/8/2021,3,"The bowl I ordered was very good, however, DO NOT order the SUSHI. I have had better from the 7/11 dumpster. All in all if you avoid the sushi you will have a very pleasant experience however if you make the mistake I did you will be less than satisfied."
10/14/2019,3,"Came here for lunch today for the first time, the cashier/server didn't give much instruction and guidance on how the menu works, I was rushed to pick the first thing I saw. I had a bento with curry Tofu, the food was subpar: chips (?) and stir fried noodles were staled with a funny taste, sting beans were half-cooked, the curry lacked flavor. Will come back again to give it another try and update this review."
5/10/2021,1,"Ordered some poke bowls for pickup and received very small portions (they filled less than half of the bowls) and some ingredients were missing. Also, the salmon wasn't fresh. I don't recommend this place."
6/6/2021,1,This was the slowest restaurant on earth.  They have no idea what they are doing.  Negative 5 stars for service.
4/9/2021,3,Food ok but they raised prices about $2 or more a dish. I think a bit expensive for basically fast food.
9/25/2020,1,"Not very accommodating, would not let me get sides I wanted for the bento box and I was willing to pay extra also. The sesame chicken wasn't breaded and their menu didn't state so when I got it I tried to return it because it's not what I wanted but they denied my exchange. Poor service also."
8/11/2019,4,The food was pretty good.  The inside was very loud because of the echos.  We ended up sitting outside.
9/28/2019,3,Good food. But they are really slow. Asked for a regular poke bowl and waited more that 30 minutes!!!!!Not sure I'll come back.
5/18/2020,5,Loved this place every time I went to Orlando I would make sure to get Bento. I was so happy when i found out they were brining it to Boca! You must try the Boba tea. Also recommend the sushi bento boxes and the poke bowls!
1/9/2020,3,"Was taken here by my boss for a lunch catch-up and I was excited as I had never been.  As much as I want to say I loved it and can't wait to go back, I'd change a couple of things if I did return.  The atmosphere was so loud it literally felt like I was shouting at my boss in line and then started to lose my voice a bit, bizarre.  We got as far away from the crowd as we could just so we could have a decent conversation.  There were no napkins on the table and although we ordered together, we didn't receive our food at the same time - and her food wasn't correct to what she ordered.  The food itself was good, although not enough protein in the bowl in comparison to everything else that was included.  I wasn't disappointed at all, just not blown away enough to put it on my ""must return"" lists.  The spicy tofu WAS something that may pull me back in....."
12/25/2020,5,Food is excellent and pricing is very reasonable! The pao pao chicken and the poke bowls are our favorites. This is our go to spot.
3/7/2021,1,"This is not the spot to go to if you're Asian and accidentally standing on the wrong line.  We were there earlier today, a few minutes before two very entitled rude racist older white men.  We were just accidentally standing in the wrong line (should have paid attention to the signs on the floor, but didn't).  The cashier closer to the fridge and exit door saw us there and acknowledged that we were there before the so-not-gentlemen but still sided with these undesirable characters instead of doing the right thing.  These two men lied... we saw them going in, and they saw us standing on the wrong line.  A quick look at the CCTV would have shown who were right.. Yeah, we walked out after experiencing such excellent customer service though the other register:cashier asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager.  Why should we be subjected to such treatment while the two very nice men were still serviced? Why would they allow such negativity toward other customers?  So yeah, we walked out because we didn't want to be victims.  We called and spoke to the store manager named Emily to ensure she's aware of this incident.  While she said that she would make things right if we were to give it a try next time; they left nothing to be desired to come back."
3/14/2021,2,"The food from this place is great. However, the delivery system at your location in Boca Raton, on Military Trail, is bad. We ordered yesterday and the food didn't come. We ordered today and the food didn't come. And happened again at least two times in the last month. Folks, you have to fix how the food is delivered otherwise you will start to lose customers . Where was the food delivered all those times, because was obviously not ""delivered"" to the one who ordered it . Today was Ursula in charge to bring the food. She didn't."
11/14/2019,3,"Have picked up and ate here a couple of times.  Food has been ok. The first time I ordered to go the lady on the phone told me 15 to 20 minutes and it took over 40 minutes for my poke bowl to be ready. Today I ordered from Uber eats (poke bowl) and fish didn't taste fresh.Also in the store you get to choose 5 toppings and on Uber eats only allows 4 , when I put a note to please add ginger they didn't do it."
12/6/2019,1,"We got here at 11:15. We've been in line and it's 11:40. They are not efficient at all. This is ridiculous!!!*UPDATE*They brought our food out. One at a time. 15 mins apart. I guess you can only get takeout from this slum. From the manager ""our concept is to bring out food as it's ready"" so you want people to eat separately?"
10/17/2019,1,"The food is OK but it doesn't make up for the awful customer service I ordered my food at 11:28 at 11:55 my food is still not ready so I asked How much longer because I am going to be late back to work and I'm unable to eat my food...the manager is unwilling to help and they forgot my dumplings until I asked where my food was I was told the dumplings take longer because they're deep-fried I just watch the chefs throw them in and a deep fry doesn't take 30 minutes, the manager didn't know how to handle the situation and I would not recommend this location to anyone"
10/11/2019,1,We have been going to Bento Gainesville and Davie for years now and so excited when the Boca Raton location opened.  Unfortunately on first and second try it has not been the same experience.  Today I ordered a standard Poke Bowl with greens.  The order was placed and I was told after 20 minutes of waiting that they ran out of greens.  They offered to make a bowl with rice or noodles and I was ok with the changes. As another 10 minutes went by I asked where the order was and was told they where still making it.   Unacceptable!   I asked for a refund which was completed and yet the order had not been finished. You would think that after waiting for 20 minutes and having to make a order change that the corrected one would have been expedited.   I hope that the Boca location works out there issues and let's everyone know.  M
9/28/2019,4,"Clean location and fair price point for sushi orders. Only issue is with the waiting time as I haven't ever seen it extremely busy, however with an order ahead option I should be able to be in and out quicker in future visits."
1/17/2020,5,I really liked this place. The variety is great and there's plenty of seating. The person that took my order helped me out alot (it was my first time) the food was good! I also got chocolate boba.
2/19/2021,5,"I love coming to this location, it's always so clean and the atmosphere is great.  The food is always great, the staff is super friendly and Emily is always so helpful!"
8/13/2019,5,"Used to work at bento when I lived in Orlando. I was part of their opening staff at UCF and I've loved their food ever since! Couldn't wait till they opened up in my hometown area. I visited during soft opening and it was just as good as I remember. So happy! Red curry udon noodle bowl, special Mexican and red dragon are my go-tos. Boba is good too!"
2/8/2021,1,I ordered the orange chicken lo mein. The chicken was soggy and it did not taste good.
12/22/2019,4,Good homogenized chain Korean Bento Box experience. Pleasant seating outside. Newer opened restaurant getting up to speed. No beer or Saki yet. I've had better experience at different location but they'll pull it all together as it's a good brand for many thing Asian. Sushi was fine. Korean was as expected but don't expect authentic Korean experience with numerous sides.
1/28/2020,1,First time tonight. Horrible experience. Staff really tried and was very nice.  My dinner came out waited for my husbands.  Finally we asked and were told they were out of white rice. Really?? So told them brown rice was fine. Waited and waited. I finally went and asked for manager. Waited and waited. Apparently Caroline was too busy to speak to us so we left. Have never experienced a mismanaged business like this. Will never return or recommend. A shame.
1/26/2020,4,"It seems to have become our default  spot for a quick bite. Love the options of the Poké, the specials and definitely love the Boba drinks.We've tried the Poke bowls, the bento boxes and some of the specials and not been disappointed.Definitely worth a visitt if you are in the area and in the mood for a quick bite."
7/20/2020,2,They have open only to eat outside. The tables are dirty and the trash is full while personnel is Inside with a lot of time waist.
1/14/2020,4,"I order form here all the time. They've messed up my order about twice and I was furious about it.  The manager called and made it up to me for their mistake and handled it like a professional. Most places don't handle these situations so well so I never care to go back. Bento is all around good unless they short you on the protein in your order. The manager was a stand up guy, took care of me. Which showed that Bento has more than just good food to offer. I put 4 stars because the last two times I ordered I was given very close to little chicken again. But other than that, this specific bento location is amazing"
3/13/2020,4,Yummy in my tummy. Perfectly prepared to what I ordered. The steak was perfectly cooked and the vegetables were a good combination with the noodles I choose. I will return upon my next visit to Florida since you have yet to be anywhere else.
10/2/2019,5,"Every time I've gone here so far, the food has been fresh and delicious! The wait times have been extremely short, although I have a tendency to go during irregular hours. I've tried their regular dishes, their poké bowls, and their bubble teas and have enjoyed both the food quality and the aesthetic  presentation. The staff have been polite and courteous, even if they are new to the job or if there's been a mistake (I once accidentally left without part of my order, but they got it to me immediately when I came back in). This is a very new location as of when I'm writing this review, so I hope they keep up the great work! :)"
8/21/2019,2,I know that this location is new but the service was subpar. Took forever to get our food and we had 3 people at our table with everyone getting their food at different Times in a 20 minute window. We asked multiple times about our orders and the staff seemed totally confused. Hopefully they can fix the service as customers were frustrated waiting on food.
12/19/2019,5,Ordered the pao pao chicken bowl and a ten piece sushi roll and it was absolutely amazing. This is the spot for sure.
1/29/2020,4,It gets real crowded at lunch and sometimes hard to find a table but the beef teriyaki bento boxes are awesome.
11/21/2019,1,"It is impossible to screw up consecutive orders. Therefore, your are intentionally incompetent. I'll kill myself before I eat there again."
10/3/2019,3,"I've tried a few things here and am just not crazy about anything. Nothing is really that good. It's quick cheap(ish) Chinese food. I don't like how on the check out screen when it asks for a tip, it makes it pretty confusing and complicated to say ""no"" because there isn't any option to say no. You have to click ""other"" and then press enter. It's annoying and I think they did that on purpose."
8/8/2019,2,If you like really greasy food then this is the place for you. I ordered some sort of veggie bowl which I thought would be healthy and I asked for tofu which they told me they only have fried tofu so I passed on the tofu. When my order came it was just really loaded with greasy vegetables (and not many). I guess this place is just not for me.
12/19/2019,2,DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU ARE GLUTEN FREE OR VEGAN. The staff looks at you like you have 3 heads when you even mention the concept of a gluten free or vegan menu or just lie to you because they have no clue. I went here on 4 separate occasions every time they got my order wrong and had to remake it or told me that something was gluten free later to find out it really  wasn't. Finally the manager got Involved and told me that all of the products come into contact with meat and gluten except for the rice. Don't waste your time the place isn't fresh it's all processed and sent from a factory. SIDE NOTE when I was not gluten free or vegan the spicy cream chicken with udon noodles is amazing even though it leaves you with a stomach ache after
9/21/2020,1,Took almost 15 minutes longer than expected. The lady at the cashier was super rude and unhelpful and ALL 3 cooks in kitchen had their nose sticking out of the mask. I am super disappointed.
9/21/2019,3,"The place looks great, great location and ambiance. I went with my son. He ordered a sushi box and I ordered the Mongolian beef over rice. My order came relatively fast, the portion was a good size, but just like another reviewer said. It's quantity over quality and for the price 5 spices at yamato is way better. After about 15 minutes my son's sushi had arrived. No wasabi or ginger was included which when you eat sushi is a must have. We had to ask for it and they brought it to our table. The place was kind of empty so not sure why they would forget to add it to the box.I may give it another chance, but it was disappointing.If paying with a credit card the system ask for the tip, you have to click other if you don't want to leave a tip, I gave a tip before I eat my food! I did have a good impression when I entered the place, but left with a bad impression."
8/28/2019,3,"Good food but you have to wait forever for it and you pay for the quality for sure. They also ask for a tip when you pay with a credit card and to not leave a tip you have to find the ""other"" button and type in 0. Makes you feel bad on purpose for not tipping which is a pet peeve of mine. Bento should pay their employees, not have them rely on tips. I should tip because of good service, not try to be forced into it and then proceed to wait for 15 minutes for my food."
10/16/2019,5,"Best bento bowls in town. The Pao Pao chicken has so much flavor! Also try the seasonal Zombie Roll, it's amazing Will be back soon!"
10/31/2019,1,"Wanted extra avocado, didn't get much at all. Didn't get much of anything Overpriced. Food not terrible. I went back a second time and I totally regretted it. I watched as the line cook prepare my food and he kept wiping his gloves on a dirty rag that kept touching the trash. Totally grossed me out."
4/29/2020,1,Hi I'm trying to order over the phone but it hangs up as soon as I press 1. I don't want to order online because door dashed prices are increased.
11/1/2019,1,If you want Asian food this is not the place. Everything on my plate was unappetizing and tasted terrible. The lo Mein and schezuan chicken were the worst part.
10/14/2019,5,Excellent!! Highly recommend! Great food with very reasonable prices! Service was great and they were happy to make substitutions when requested! We will be back for sure!
11/11/2019,2,"We wanted to like Bento, because it's close to our house and we love Asian food.   We ordered 4 dishes to share, pork egg rolls, fried dumplings, Bento box with broccoli/tofu and Sesame stir fry with beef.  The pork rolls were not hot, very average.  The fried dumplings were overcooked, very dry, didn't finish them.  The bento box broccoli/tofu was overwhelmed by the strong, dark sauce (seemed like the exact same sauce in the beef stir fry.   The salad in the bento box was wilted and dressing too sweet.   Also, our main courses were delivered first and as we were halfway thru them, the appetizers arrived.   Overall, all of the food had a 'too sweet' taste and all kind of tasted the same.    Disappointed and will not return."
10/4/2019,5,I'm so happy there's finally one close to me. I used to drive 45 minutes to David every once in a while. It should buy out every other fast food ish Asian restaurant (like Pei Wei). I get the teriyaki chicken bento box with extra rice and no salad. I can't believe they have yum yum/white sauce. Amazing place.
9/11/2019,1,Very disappointed because the location in Davie was excellent.  Food just okay. They don't serve brewed ice tea like Davie and have an  ordinary soda machine. The davie one has a great soda machine with lots of variety to add flavors etc. not inclined to go back but will visit Davie again.
10/9/2020,3,"don't take this personal, this is Constructive criticism ..you cannot served hot food in a plastic container, it makes the food taste like plastic ,, besides , its a potential health risks , i saw one of your employee stir a entire bucket of hot rice inside a plastic bus tub, ??? you are suppose to use a metal or glass container, i know that due to the Virus, you guys serve food in plastic containers, but the right way to do it, is to put a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the plastic container so that your food does not taste like plastic..."
8/15/2019,5,"This new location in Boca Raton is a dream come true. I have visited their other locations when I am traveling in the state of Florida, but was finally happy that Bento is finally in Boca Raton. Their food is great and the service was great. I will visit this location again and again. Keep up the good work and cannot wait to return to this location for amazing food."
10/30/2022,5,"Once again Bento is still amazing! I just ordered the veggie stir fry with chicken and rice and it was out of this world! It's not fried which is a plus and it has a great variety of veggies that it comes with. The portion was also perfect so it definitely does not disappoint.One new service feature from this visit is they now have a menu screen to order from. This allows you to see a visual of all the items included in your order, and since I'm a visual person it makes the experience all the better. The food was also brought out super quickly so I was very surprised!I also ordered the Pick 2 Poke Bowl since I have been broadening my horizons in the world of Poke! I got the soy salmon and soy tuna as bases with rice. Then for toppings I got cucumbers, edamame, seaweed salad, kimchi, ginger, sesame seeds and avocado. The kimchi and seaweed salad choices really made this bowl stand out so I was surprised. Overall, Bento continues to be a great experience. I love the food and I wish there were more around so I don't have to drive so far to go to one"
9/15/2022,2,"Vegans/Vegetarians beware!!Been here two times. First time was good. I got the avocado roll and tofu bento box. Second time was not good.Here's the negative for me: I ordered a tofu bowl. Tofu is very dense and chewy. First time I went it was the same way. Very difficult to eat. Sauce has good flavor though. Found some pieces of chicken in my bowl. I am vegan and don't consume chicken. This completely ruined my appetite. I understand they cater to all eaters and I am grateful for that, but I am a little disappointed that extra care is not taken to prevent mixing meat and tofu. Don't think I'll be coming back."
9/3/2022,3,"I believe this was my third time coming to Bento and I have to say that the food did not disappoint today. The past couple of times I ordered sushi and I'd say it's probably not my favorite thing to order. So today, I decided to go with something different. Today I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. It was quite delicious! I was going to have it as a combo, but their soda fountain was not working and they wouldn't give us the option to order it as a combo with a bottled drink. I decided to order a Jasmine Milk Tea with Honey boba, which was not the greatest. I also ordered a side of edamame. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Lo Mein and that is probably what I'll be ordering next time as it was fantastic! Overall, staff is nice, atmosphere is comfortable and the food is good."
11/30/2022,4,"The girl at the register was nice, I was surprised how empty this location was but it was a weekday. Restaurant seems very clean and food was tasty. I ordered the pao pao chicken with lo mien noodles and my daughter ordered Mongolian steak which ended up accidentally getting chicken but she was happy with it and the staff was kind and ready to correct the mistake. We will be returning"
9/3/2022,3,"If you are in the area and are craving some thing Asian, this is the spot for you!  I've been here before and usually get the bento box, but today I decided to have something different. I decided to try the Shanghai lo mein noodles with chicken as my protein.  My dish was amazing, it was not spicy and the ingredients blended so well.  My girlfriend had the Pad Thai and she liked hers too, but said that mine tasted better. I will have to agree with her on that observation.Now I usually get a combo when I come over but today their soda machine was down and I was told that due to to that, they could not give me a combo, which consists of a fountain drink and a side. I wish that they could have accommodated us with still giving us the combo options but substitute the fountain drink with a bottle drink.I hope to have a better experience the next time I come by."
10/24/2022,4,"I have passed by this place many times and finally decided to try it. I ordered the bento box which came with rice, lo mein, ginger salad, garlic string beans and your choice of protein or veggies.  For my protein I picked the Sichuan chicken. The food and service was good."
7/19/2022,4,"Yummy! Came for lunch with some friends and enjoyed my food! In the pricier end... they've raised their prices.I got the pao pao shrimp, spice level III. I got lo mein with it and it was delicious. I would get this again. I used to get sriracha garlic chicken but I didn't see it. I later saw that they renamed it to the spicy gochujang (fyi)."
6/28/2022,4,"I used to not be a fan of this location, honestly it must have just been a bad day or new chef. But I get that there's a reason for the popularity so I figured I'd try it again and have gone a few times since! For fast casual asian fusion, it's actually really good. My go to choices are the pao pao shrimp with noodles or sushi. That pao pao sauce is basically bang bang sauce but so much more addicting, especially in their super crispy shrimp tempura. Everything is pretty affordable and quick service. Things I'm not so much a fan of are their boba and the fact that there's no booth seating. If I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite it's still a solid option though with great variety."
4/7/2022,3,"I have always really loved eating at Bento and as a college student this place is nearby and most of the time fast. Recently, my experiences were not as good as they had been before. I frequently order the Pao Pao tofu bowl and haven't really had a good time. The bowl flavoring is pretty good, but not as good as before. In addition, I have recently been getting more trouble with my stomach after eating here. I do enjoy the boba teas here and started to order the lychee slush with honey boba. This was a really good option and I would really recommend getting the drinks here!"
4/10/2022,3,"I had the Mongolian beef rice bowl. For $14, I wold have expected more. Maybe 3 ounces of steak, and that's a stretch. The vegetables were mostly the cheap vegetables, onions and scallions. And it's on rice, it's rice,  the worlds most cost effective food. So basically you're paying $14 for onions, scallions, and rice. Also it was heavy on the Mongolian sauce. They also went away with my favorite I've been getting for 20 years now, teriyaki steak! I'll try another dish in couple weeks and see if it was just a bad day."
7/25/2022,4,"Found this Asian spot located in a plaza off 595 & University. Too my surprise it was what I was looking for that day, quick yummy asian bowl. I tried the terriyaki chicken with fried rice & string beans. It was a huge portion enough for two servings, it had great taste. My hubby got the steak with rice, very tasty as well. You order at the entry cashier and food is brought to you. Service was good  & fast, presentation  on point. The only thing is we did not read menu well, they do charge xtra for fried rice & also the steak upgrade, we also added the combo $4.50 xtra. There is lots of options, We will return again for sure."
11/19/2022,2,"Food ok. But they want to pay for more hot sauce. So I have go back and make the line again to pay for, you gotta be joking."
3/16/2022,5,"SUPER TASTY FOOD! They have sushi rolls, poke bowls, chicken, etc. They offer so many different types of food options for all ages. Their tuna tastes so fresh, it's awesome!"
9/1/2022,5,"This location has definitely been a regular spot to eat at for my boyfriend and I. We have tried many different options and each time it hasn't disappointed us! It's a very cozy and chill environment, and their service is so quick! Whether you order ahead or just dine in, it's always so fresh and delicious! We also love how there's a small holder on every table inside that includes chopsticks, it's so convenient! We will definitely still be coming here whenever we crave some sushi and boba drinks!"
7/24/2022,5,"Bento is easily one of my top 3 fast casual dining places in Florida! I have loved pretty much every different plate I have tried here- from sushi, to bento boxes, to rice bowls, to raro smoothies and my personal favorite their Poke bowls! So greasy and so good! Don't forgot to sauce it up! Usually their service is also top notch. I recommend Bento to most of my friends and family, and they have always enjoyed it as much as I have! 10/10 would highly encourage you to try their poke bowls and their raro smoothies"
7/28/2022,4,"Service was great food was ehh ok, good enough to fill the stomach but more fast food like taste in my opinion, place was clean, had the Miami roll thought it would be better but wasn't bad, lacked a little more punch in taste, garlic broccoli chicken was good.  Gochujang Garlic Chicken was great in taste prob their best dish, Give it a try."
10/25/2022,2,"Taste was good. However, what you get in terms of substance (protein) versus the amount of fluff (rice or lettuce) is gastronomic fraud. Its doesn't surpass being a business looking to make a buck. Completely lacks soul. Also staff look miserable. Like zombies. Eating here feels like getting swindled... or transactional sex with a liberal chick that keeps plan B in her purse. Empty and worthless. Will make you appreciate eating at other places."
4/11/2021,4,"We frequent Bento for convenient and tasty takeout. They have easy kids boxes for about $6 like katsu kids box and teriyaki kids box that my 4 year old and 6 year old love.We really enjoy the poke bowls that are a decent portion of fresh fish and veggies at reasonable price at $10 for mini and $14 for regular size.Bento also sells Bento boxes, rice bowls and noodle bowls and seems to be Asian fusion. Dishes range from red coconut curry, spicy beef bulgogi and szechuan box.They also currently have an online family meal special of 4 bowls for $38."
10/8/2021,4,I love ordering from here for dine in or take out. The food is always fresh and absolutely delicious! Their poke bowls are probably one of my top favorite things to order. I recently tried their Zombie roll which is available for a limited time and it was so good! Their fried rice is also great as well. They have a good menu with plenty of options too. Place is clean and staff is friendly and very helpful.
8/31/2022,5,best spicy tuna roll hands down. and i've had LOTS of sushi!!!!! I usually manage to get a deal on uber eats and this place is my go to. i just wish the spicy mayos were a little bigger so i didn't have to order so many
8/11/2022,3,"A little pricey for what it is, but food is relatively fresh and taste is on point. I would recommend the bowls."
8/20/2022,4,We ordered the pineapple sweet and sour chicken with noodles as the base as well as a bento box. Both were delicious! This place is great for some quick asian food. Their menu is pretty expensive as well
11/8/2022,1,Tried to dine in but ended up leaving because I was getting swarmed by fruit flies while trying to eat. Unfriendly staff too. Asked for one of those bigger plastic to-go boxes since my entire meal was uneaten and they just stared at me and were unhelpful.
12/8/2021,5,"We are regular customers of Bento and always enjoy the food; but, this review is for catering only. I ordered the Samurai sushi platter for a holiday party last Saturday and it was the best looking sushi platter I have ever seen. The platter has 64 pieces of sushi (2 rainbow rolls, 2 special Mexican rolls, 2 Mount Fuji rolls, 2 spicy tuna rolls). All of the sushi was fresh and delicious and the garnishes on the platter were amazing. Someone took a lot of time making this platter look great. Unfortunately I didn't get a picture before everyone started digging in. The manager was super friendly during pickup too. They even gave us take home boxes for my guest to use. This location will be my go to catering location for sushi from now on."
11/7/2022,3,Average quick bite. But if you want some better quality go across the street to a real sushi place.
11/18/2020,4,"First time seeing a fast casual sushi spot & it did not disappoint!Combination lunch with side & drink can run a little high ($20) but was it worth it?Yes, food was filling, flavorful & fast. They also have boba tea which I did not get to enjoy but next time!!! Hope to see a location in miami soon.Would definitely take hubby on a lunch date here."
5/24/2021,1,"This review is based solely on takeout, from this past Sunday. My husband called many times to place an order over the phone, but there was no answer. It took him about a 15 minute drive to arrive, so by the time he got there, he hung up the phone and placed the order in person. For years, I've always been able to sub what's in the bento box. But yesterday, my husband was told the menu changed and we are no longer allowed to sub what's in the bento box. Which I still don't believe. My husband ordered us a bento box, a rice bowl and a sushi combo box. After about 10 minutes of waiting, the cashier went over to him and told him it would be an additional 10 minutes. Mind you, there was no one else waiting for their food. He was the only one who was in line and who was waiting for their food. He took notice that our bento box and rice bowl were sitting in the window for about 10 minutes but he was still waiting on our sushi combo box. Now another 20 minutes go by, and he's still waiting. By the time all of our food was packed, it was 40 minutes, with about 30 minutes of our ""hot"" food just sitting in the window. This is totally unacceptable. Our food should be cooked and timed to be packaged, at the same time. Not have one thing ready at one time, and another thing ready at another time. You'd think the restaurant would have noticed and offered to re-make our hot food, but they didn't."
7/30/2022,4,Good fast place for fast dining and good sushi/thai . good prices and fast staff make this a great lunch spot in the area!
5/4/2022,4,"Pork dumplings, are gas. Veggie stir fry is orgasmic. I honestly haven't had anything I wouldn't have again. Thank you for existing and making my hard days at work so much more enjoyable during lunch time."
6/23/2020,4,"As a UF alum, I frequented the original Bento locations in Gainesville. When I discovered the Davie location, it quickly became a dependable restaurant for fast, Asian food. Especially during the pandemic, Bento was proactive in keeping customers updated, releasing discounts/promotions, and following mandated safety guidelines. I always call ahead for my to-go orders, and the food is usually done within 15 minutes.I typically order their build-your-own poke bowls, but have also tried various kitchen items. Although their food is tasty, it definitely lacks authenticity, especially with such a large menu. However, it is easy to find a dish suitable for everyone. My biggest concern is with their portion sizes; I find myself hungry very soon after finishing one of their meals. Although the prices are reasonable, their bowls are mainly comprised of noodles/rice, instead of the meat, fish, etc. Nonetheless, Bento has always been clean and dependable."
9/28/2021,5,"I have been to this location so many times and they never let me down. The front end staff / cashier are excellent, when they take your order they have no problems answering questions about the food or going back to the kitchen quickly to find out more for question they don't know the answer too ,  The food is always consistently delicious and every dish from sushi to hot foods is never let down. Now when it comes to their green beans I do not understand how they make it so fresh and so tasty.Incredible place definitely one of the best chains out there in the state. I do not recommend takeout or delivery especially for hot food with fried chicken in it as the food will get soggy but that's anywhere."
9/14/2021,5,"Ordered a bento katsu bowl from here and sushi roll, it was so delicious highly recommend."
3/12/2020,5,"Thought this would be a nice place to take my grandma to for lunch, especially since she LOVES asian cuisine! Ive been here quite a few times myself and have always tried something different! My grandma ordered the garlic broccoli shrimp brown rice bowl, which she thought was super tasty! Personally, I stick with the udon noodles as my base because they are nice and think and I love the slurp. I was in a vegetarian mood today and went with the tofu, which was nice because it had the right amount of crispiness on the outside! My bowl didn't look like it was oversized and I thought I could finish it all in one sitting, but halfway through, I was stuffed. The portions here are definitely enough to make two meals, so you know you're getting your money's worth. If you dine in, make sure to bring a jacket! It's usually pretty chilly in here."
9/28/2022,1,"Karina is very disrespectful! Said I was ""disrespectful and nasty"" because I asked another employee to remake my drink. I called the store after leaving to leave a complaint and she answered then hung up while I was talking. She's a disgusting dog and needs to be demoted to cleaning toilets until she learns to fix her nasty attitude!"
9/16/2022,3,"The food is okay, but the prices are higher than you would expect from a restaurant with counter service and a fast food feel. For the same price as a roll and a bowl of soup you can go down the road to get all you can eat at Shinju."
6/9/2022,3,MY CHICKEN IS PINK!!! SALMONELLA. not okay at all didn't taste right either. Thank you.
1/7/2020,5,"Thank god I don't have a place like this near my house, or I would be here everyday! The concept of the restaurant is you can choose to have a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box, and then from there you choose what entree (i.e. red curry, bulgogi, teriyaki, etc.) you would like. You can also build your own poke bowl or order some sushi rolls. I ordered some bowls and sushi, and I was thoroughly impressed! Some dishes ordered:mongolian steak: 5/5, extremely flavorful dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was balanced and just the right consistency. The vegetables to meat ratio was spot-on too! Very tasty entree. volcano roll: 5/5, my favorite things in sushi are cream cheese and spicy mayo, so of course I had to order this roll! The imitation crab was fresh, and the baked salmon was a nice touch. Really flavorful roll!!Service: 5/5, I ordered a to-go order, and the servers were so friendly! They quickly brought out my food, and offered to get me any sauces or utensils I needed. I can't wait to visit Florida again just to eat here! I will be back to try everything!"
11/23/2019,4,"This modern asian variety fast casual restaurant located in Davie offers bento boxes, poke bowls, Chinese style dishes, sushi rolls, bobo tea and more. It's fast casual so you line up and order at the front and your meal is then brought to your table. The prices are pretty reasonable and the quality good. I visited for the first time recently and tried the ""Hawaiian Poke Bowl""; the ingredients were fresh and plentiful although it was a tad too salty (most likely too much soy sauce). They also have a build your own option which might be a better wayLooking around I saw a lot of great looking dishes on other people's table and would definitely like to re visit and try some of their other items."
9/26/2021,1,"Unfortunately, I hate leaving reviews like this, working in customer service myself, but needless to say I feel the need to post this.  We walked in and were not greeted in a friendly manner. We asked how to order, and the young lady didn't wish to explain how they worked. She just pointed to the menu without saying anything. We ordered udon noodle soup with chicken Katsu, qnd chicken broth. After ordering, we waited about 10 minutes, and they gave us two large miso soups with udon noodles - while simultaneously we could hear the employees giggling about it behind the counter, creating a hostile customer experience.  From this experience alone, I would highly suggest not wasting your time and  money here. It really sucks to post something so negative especially working in customer service, because I do get it. Go somewhere else where the staff operates in a more professional manner, and creates an overall welcoming experience. Corporate,  please don't reach out to me, j have an extremely sour taste in my mouth from this whole dining experience."
10/29/2019,4,"Been coming to Bento for a while now and the consistency has been on point. I don't stray too much so I typically get the bento box with the Pao Pai spicy cream chicken(extra crispy). The chicken is really tasty and the sauce is just the right amount. The bento box comes with rice, noodles and a salad all for $10.50 which is a solid deal IMO.  They also sell desserts but as a little bonus, the bento box has some sugary cinnamon chips which does the job for me. Even though it's a chain restaurant, it doesn't take like one and I suggest you try it if you have not."
10/18/2020,4,"This is for the Davie location...the food is still good. I got the sushi combo it comes with 8 pieces of California rolls and 4 pieces of 2 of their classic sushi. I got rainbow and the caleninte rolls. The caleninte roll was the best but all the sushi was good over all. The sides is where it lacked, not so much in taste but only four tiny cucumber pieces for the kimchi and the salad had little to do dressing. Uts sad because both actually did taste good."
8/27/2019,4,"Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi is a great concept. It's good Asian food fast at affordable prices. They offer Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes. From General tso to red curry to rainbow roll & many more tasty Asian dishes all in one spot. Can't go wrong.This location is in a large popular/busy shopping center. Finding a parking spot during certain days/times can prove challenging. This Bento is big, bright, clean and has a simple modern Asian inspired decor. The staff is polite and helpful. You order at the counter and place the number you are given on your table. The food/boba beverage is brought to your table. They also have self serve fountains drinks next to the utensils and napkins. The chopsticks and soy sauce bottles are already on the table. Once you've done, a staff member will come by and clear the table. Three out of four times I visited so far have been good/solid. The other time could've been better. But all in all like the concept, food, ambiance and affordable prices."
10/1/2020,3,"I'm familiar with Bento back in Gainesville where it originated from but I'm not really a fan... I get the slight appeal since it seems like busy college students can get their quick Asian food fix at a somewhat reasonable price but I think it could better. For the price, I think the quality is low and portions are small. I've tried their sushi rolls, bowls, bento boxes, udon noodle and if I HAD to choose, I would say the bowls are probably the most worth. I think there are better Asian restaurants in the area but if you want a really quick fix for your craving and willing to spend at least $10 for your meal then I guess you could come here."
3/25/2022,5,AmZing and delicious food ! Crunchy veggies and juicy chicken :) and mickayla was so helpful when choosing the right bowl! I ordered the stir fry chicken and she was right ... it was the bomb:) will come back asap
8/15/2019,5,"This was my go to lunch spot every week when I worked closer to this Davie, FL location. Now that I'm further away, I hope they open one either closer to my new job or close to my house. I sometimes take the trip on the weekend to satisfy my Bento cravings. They are located in Davie, right off of University Drive in the Home Depot Plaza just south of I595, very busy and conveniently located spot. They get super busy at lunchtime so I recommend getting there no later than 11:45AM - 12PM. Although the line can be long at times, it moves very fast.The atmosphere is hip and eye catching. I love the ambiance and feel of this spot every time I'm here. Parking can be tricky if you don't arrive by 11:30AM - 11:45AM. Since they are in a plaza with so many other business's, there is additional parking all over so you will find something. The Food! This is why this place is so popular. The food is so good and they offer a big variety of dishes. They have everything from sushi to signature bowls to build your own poke bowl which is what I always get. I usually order the Build Your Own because I like selecting everything that goes in it. They also offer Boba Tea's. I get the Boba mango with mango jellies...YUM! They have a kids menu as well which is great. This place is a must."
8/2/2020,4,"Bento has saved the day (or night) when everyone was closing early due to Covid. Their food is piping hot and flavorful. I love the Mt. Fuji sushi.  Visually appealing and tastefully pleasing!! Although they're not having dine in at the moment,  the take out was so worth it! Friendly staff and food came out in less than 10 minutes.  Ive been to this location a few times and thought I wrote a review but I guess I didn't!"
6/16/2019,5,"I've been a huge fan of Bento for years and I was so glad when it moved down to south Florida! This has a great atmosphere, friendly service and delicious food. On this visit we luckily had no wait to order although it seemed the dining area was relatively busy. Our food was delivered to our table in no joke 5 minutes! I can't believe how fast it was! Maybe it was just our lucky day.I get the same thing most time that I come, I love the sweet and sour chicken with a mango boba on the side. On occasion I will order the bento box which never disappoints. They have good sushi too. In the past I have made a telephone order for to-go a couple times and never had a bad experience with that either. If you haven't been, you need to give it a try!"
9/11/2022,1,"This place used to be excellent. Now they serve very little, the soda machine is filthy, the beverages taste like tap water, the staff is rude, and the cashier doesn't know menu items. On top of that, they tip themselves auto adding a 15% tip to for bad service and don't tell you about this when paying. I looked at my receipt after paying and would have tipped twice had I selected add tip option. The total they tell you is not what you pay. This is likely why they have a sign that reads cards accepted only. I mean, what business doesnt accept cash?? I wanted to tip cash directly to the server. The screen asked for a second tip and only shows you the pre-tip total. This goes for anyone, and is not based on the size of your party. The salad had no dressing and was just lettuce, the California rolls looked old and dried out. Wish I'd read Yelp first.  Never again, going to the poke place next time."
3/20/2021,3,"The first time I visited this restaurant was on a slow day in the middle of the week. Everything went smoothly and the food was good.The second time the experience was much different. My poke bowl came out quickly but I also ordered 4 piece sushi and my boyfriend ordered a full sushi roll. After about 20 minutes of waiting at our table, watching people that came in after us get food before us, someone approached our table and asked if we had gotten the full sushi roll we were waiting on. We told them no and reminded the person about the smaller sushi order. My boyfriend's order then came out about 5 minutes afterward, packaged in a to-go container even though we were eating in. No big deal about the container but there was still more of a wait for the rest of the order to come out. When the 4 pieces of sushi finally came out the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was dark gray. I also had tuna in my poke bowl which was fresh and bright pink so clearly the roll I just waited nearly 40 minutes for was not fresh. I was excited to return after my first visit but I would really have to be in the mood for this and in the immediate area to visit again."
4/10/2021,5,This place is so yummy and decently priced if you don't try everything on the menu. Ha ha
7/23/2020,4,"My favorite thing about Bento is the fact that it's very customizable. If you are getting a bowl then you can choose a base (lo-mein, udon noodles, or rice), an entree (red curry, kung pao, sriracha garlic, etc.), and then a meat (or tofu for vegetarians!). My go-to dish is always the red curry with udon noodles and tofu. I do love Bento but unfortunatley I do think their food lacks authenticity. If you are looking for a truly authentic dish, then this is not the place to go. But if you love asian cuisine, I'd definitely give this place a try! The menu is extensive and truthfully overwhelming if it's your first time but I love that that there are so many options on the menu. I'd recommend taking a look at the menu before going to Bento. Some of the items on the menu besides the customizable entree bowls are poke bowls, sushi, and bento boxes. I'm not a fan of their boba teas. I've tried multiple and the boba itself is always too hard and very chewy. The milk teas themselves also don't taste fresh (I'm assuming powders are being used?).Additionally, during lunch/dinner time the lines are HUGE and it takes about 10-15 for takeout to come out. So I usually call ahead, place my order, and it's ready to go in about 15 minutes! It definitely very convenient and always dependable."
1/17/2022,5,"I've been here years ago, and I loved it.Today I called to cancel my order I did though the website to order on Uber eats ( lazy Monday vibes lol ) when I call, they were nice and helpful with canceling my order. Did my order though Uber eats and can't wait to get my delicious food from this location and place.I highly recommend them :)"
4/17/2021,5,First time there and was pleasantly surprised. Went for teriyaki Tuesday and was super tasty. Also 2x1 boba teas! Definitely will return
3/15/2019,4,"I love bento for a quick sushi/poke fix. I haven't had the pleasure of trying their hot kitchen- I take that back. Because for a super secret cheat meal when I'm in the YOLO feels I'll get the spicy cream which fried battered chicken bites, drenched it spicy mayo on top of a rice bowl with either red/green peppers. soooooo goood. Anywhoo, I get the spicy don with either salmon, or tuna, or you can get half and half. It comes with wakame seaweed salad, avocado, cucumber, and you should ask for some eel sauce. Sooo yummy! The sushi there aren't like specialty rolls, but they're fulfilling. This place is a quick fix. A lot of people affiliated with Nova are always here."
3/20/2022,4,"I enjoy Bento, it's great for quick takeout. I love ordering the bentos for variety and it's all really good. I sometimes also go in for a boba milk tea. Last time I got taro and it didn't really taste like taro. However my kids didn't love their Orange chicken. They did like the stir fry noodles and fried rice though."
3/1/2019,4,Came by for a quick bite with the family and the place was packed and hopping so these guys must be doing something right lol!When you enter there are menus from which you cN choose your meat and a Poke Bowl with Rice or Noodles or a Bento Box.  You then pay and sit down and as soon as your meal is ready the server will bring your meal to the table.We all ordered our individual meals and it was fresh and tasty.  A dinner for 4 with 1 appetizer and 2 ice teas and 2 iced coffees came to $88 with the tip!We will definitely be back when in the area specially as my son owns the Insurance Agency across the street from here lol!
1/30/2020,4,"I LOVE Bento! They use to only have one in Gainesville and now we have one here in Sofl, for the last couple years. I always try to stop in when I'm in the tower shops. This place is a fast casual Asian eatery. Their build your own style is something I love as I am a picky eater. Very reasonable prices and the food isn't fancy but downright delish. Think Chipotle but Asian cuisine. Try their Pao Pao chicken if you like spicy and creamy. Their Udon Pork soup is fantastic. Also Poke and Bento boxes. You really can't go wrong here. The only downside for me is that the staff seems to have a somewhat high turn over, so the service can be hit or miss. Sometimes my food is out right away and other times it takes a hot minute just get a Boba Tea.As long as the food quality stays on point I will keep coming back :)"
12/8/2018,4,"Bento holds a place close to my heart, it gives me all of my fondest college memories! This was actually my first time at the South Florida location so my expectations were pretty high. I got one of my two usuals- a build a Poke bowl. To my surprise, they gave the option of a mini- one protein in your bowl. This was the perfect size for me because I hate taking home raw fish if I can't finish it. I had salmon as my protein. Wakame (seaweed salad), cream cheese, & tempura flakes as my toppings. The tempura flakes were different from what I was used to. They resembled rice crispies & actually kind of tasted like it (ew.) The amount of toppings and extras also depends upon the size you get- mini, regular, or large. The service was pretty good & the food came out very quick! This place is pretty far from where I live but I'd come back if I was in the area. Rumor has it, there's a location opening up in Pines (yay!) Guess we'll have to wait & see!"
3/10/2020,5,"We love this location so much, we drive nearly an hour to get there. Yes it may seem crazy just for sushi, but, no other location in Miami matches the quality of their sushi for the lower cost. Not only is their food good but it's in a great plaza that you can also go shopping after you eat. They also have a lot of tables inside the establishment, so a large group shouldn't be a problem. We can't speak on the other dishes they serve since we haven't had them yet, but their sushi is a no brainer. There was only roll that we didn't like since it was a plain roll. Although it didn't taste like anything special, some soy sauce and spicy mayo fixed the issue. We have recommended this location to friends and recommend it to other people to try as well."
9/30/2021,3,"Update- 10/19/21: Bento has reached out and I have shared my concerns via email. They seem to be committed to improving and to providing a excellent customer service. For this, I have decided to change my star rating from 2 to 3. This may improve should I have several positive experiences with the food quality in my return visits.I want to like this place. We eat here nearly every other week and are constantly disappointed with the quality control of the food and service. Every other time we order there is a different problem. The Udon soup is a favorite. It's supposed to come with Bok Choy and every other time we order it, the Bok choy is missing. LOVE the flavor and noodles but they constantly miss ingredients. Don't even get me started with Uber eats orders (whole meals not in the bag). The sushi pretty awful constantly. I don't even think they make it with raw fish anymore. The service is so sporadic. We often finish one meal in a group before the others are dropped. Or we wait and it gets cold. If the food was consistent and quality I wouldn't be making this review. You might ask ""why do you still go there?"". Well because the price is right and when it's good, it's really good. Just disappoints more times than it should. Also, an observation, there seems to be no full adult supervision in this place. Where is the management?! Is this place really ran by teenagers."
11/18/2018,3,"This is my third time patronizing this establishment this year. I finally decided to write a review since I've got a taste of a variety of different items. Well let's be honest I've only had three different Poke bowls and some crab rangoons but I can talk about those and my overall experience.The most recent Pokeball I decided to go with was fried tofu and poke salmon. I did not like the fried tofu. If you notice in my photo, it was fried to the point where it was shriveled up and dry. It was quite uneventful. Tofu already doesn't have any flavor so fried in such a way made it a bit more difficult for my palate to enjoy. The combination of the mango ,the edamame, and the wakame made for good toppings. They did forget my scallions and sesame seeds but whatever. I was not about to leave my library time to go back for these items. I give this place a 3 out of 5 because it's not the greatest but it's also not the worst. You kind of get what you pay for. I also wasn't impressed with the steamed shrimp I had in another bowl. The shrimp were sliced so thin and considering it cost more and they give you less, I was disappointed. Overall, this place is good for quick bites. I've never sat down at the establishment so I can't comment on the service. It seems as though at least everyone working the registers to take your orders are very knowledgeable and super helpful. They don't rush you and considering they have so many options on the menu, it can take a while for someone to order. I appreciate that they give you the time to do that."
11/3/2021,5,"Love stopping at Bento while I am out shopping in the plaza! The food is always DELICIOUS! Love the atmosphere and the quick service. Definitely recommend if you're in the area. A great, quick, quality sushi stop."
12/3/2019,5,"Bento essentially takes all the building blocks from the noodle bowls, bento boxes and sushi, offering them in a mix-and-match format over white rice, brown rice or mixed greens, with a phalanx of zippy sauces and a nice array of crunchy toppings (nice to see togarashi and furikake, both seasoning blends that add vim to anything). There are plenty of appealing protein options here, from spicy tofu to katsu-style fried chicken, and a small handful of signature bowls with well-conceived assemblies of ingredients. The Bento location is bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows, contemporary light fixtures and chairs that hint at midcentury modern classics. The order counter is a study in red lacquer with a dramatic black side wall that is festooned with Katakana and Hiragana characters (or maybe they're just cool squiggles;not sure). It's an appealing and pleasant space, but with lots of people loitering and waiting for their to-go order, it doesn't feel like a place you'd camp out for long.I found solid offerings in nearly every category on the menu. Solid, but nothing that scaled new heights or brought the unexpected. If I have one overall criticism, it's that dishes have too much sauce, sauces that were frequently a little too sweet. A Szechuan chicken bento box ($10) made me wish for more restraint on the deep brick-colored sauce so the snow peas, broccoli and white-meat planks had more room to shine. The rest of the sectioned bento contained the classic iceberg salad with the ginger dressing, a dome of white rice, a tangle of soy-bronzed lo mein, short lengths of nicely done fried Szechuan green beans and a passel of fried wonton skin triangles drizzled with a sweet sauce. A fair amount of food for $10, and good variations of flavor and texture, but nothing knocked my socks off."
10/6/2018,4,"My cousins husband told us about Bento Cafe. They have a very busy and fast paced lifestyle with work and their kids school/extra curricular activities. Most days, they are on the go for dinner or lunch, and they frequent Bento a lot. We tried to go one evening with the kids, and the line was completely out of the door. It was a bit overwhelming. On one hand, you are thinking ""Wow! It must be really good!"" and then ""do I really want to wait in this line?""We were starving and decided to order our food to go. They don't have an app for online ordering so you either have to order in the to go line or call the order in. The first meal we had with the restaurant gave me mixed feelings. I ordered a poke bowl and when we got home and I started eating I found a black hair in my mango which is an epic fail. Besides that, the taste of the food was really good. My husband didn't really get enough time to look at the menu so after seeing my meal wished he had ordered a poke bowl as well. He said it was good, but it wasn't enough food for him. I don't remember what he got, but there was shrimp, veggies, and rice. The bowl was small. The kids got orange chicken and chicken teriyaki. Overall, the meals were pretty good for them, but in the future we would maybe find something they agreed on and order a larger portion. With how much my family frequents this place and the taste outside of my finding, I decided to try the establishment again because things happen. The downside of it for me was I was already home, and there wasn't much we could do about it. My husband and I went back again. This time we both ordered the large poke bowls. The poke soy tuna isn't anything like the poke I had in Hawaii so if that is what you are expecting... don't. You'd come closer to the taste in Hawaii getting the spicy tuna. That is my favorite for the bowl. I really love the wontons as an option, because then I was able to make little tuna wontons towers with wakame and jalapeno. We were both very pleased with the second visit. The large poke bowls come with a nice amount of food, everything is fresh and tasty, and I love the options you get to choose from. You could come up with all kinds of creations and never get bored. Bento is always crazy busy with the line to the door which says a lot about their product. I am glad I gave it another try because it really is delicious. Helpful hint: Have workers wear hair nets??"
10/2/2018,3,I stopped into Bento today and I ordered a Vietnamese Pork dish & the Sushi Combo box. The sushi here is tasty. The Vietnamese Pork dish left a lot to be desired.Another thing I noticed about this dish is in a photo that was a couple years ago the pork looked very different. It had grill marks and looked very juicy. The pork I got looked roasted in an oven or made on a skillet. I much rather would've had what they used to make. I still chalk this place up as a place I'm willing to come back to and try more things.PS - This would've easily been a 5 star review if the Vietnamese dish was on point with robust flavor.
10/19/2019,3,"So I really like this spot because I have been coming here a number of times, but unfortunately I got food poisoning from something I had there a few nights ago. I tried the pork fried dumplings and it had such a strange taste I only ate one. After that, I ordered the Creamy spicy chicken bowl with lomein; the chicken was very good but again the sauce that the lomein was tossed in had a funny taste that I could only stomach 2 bites before giving up on it. Later that night I was sick to my stomach. It definitely had to be one of those food items I ate or both. Such a disappointment."
3/1/2022,1,"Sorry, so many things wrong with this place that I would write a book if I listed everything. Don't believe the fake reviews and don't try reaching out to me to try to change my mine. If management is clueless then you shouldn't be in business. Waste of time and money. With so many good asian and sushi places out there I have no reason to ever go back!"
9/25/2018,5,"When you need a quick bite and your craving sushi, rice bowls or noodle bowls this is definitely the place. It has an option for everyone. The prices are around 11$ depending on what you get. You walk up to the counter and order they give you a number and the employees bring the food to you. It's always clean. The employee who took my order was very patient with me, she also helped explain the sauces and items I wasnt familiar with. She was very helpful and even offered me a cup for water while I wait for my food to go. Which has never happened before at other restaurants/fast service , I was very grateful for her offer.My food came fast! I was very surprised faster than usual. They've changed up the menus and organized it better. I decided to make a sushi bowl and I picked the regular size which is a very good amount of food, very good for the price. They also have available a corner with to go boxes, chopsticks and napkins available. It can get busy during dinner time but honestly it's a great place if you have a family or friends because of the big variety of options to order. I will definitely be coming back soon. Hope they make more locations soon."
12/13/2020,5,Love this place Many asian options plus some beer/beverages Sushi is fresh! The curry rocks also fried rice (upcharge)  o___o Good music & vibe Our last visit wasn't so organized as our food came out before our sushi etc. but LONDON helped make it like we know it So we'll keep coming back!!
8/31/2021,1,Terrible service food can take up to 30 mins for something simple such as fried rice. I've had weird tasting food and complained. But when asked for a refund didn't want to refund me even though I the food tasted off. Another problem is a cashier was open and didn't take us because they were too busy drawing and didn't ask us if we were ready to order until we went to the next cash register. I have been coming to the location since it has opened but in the past year the restaurant service has gone down a lot.
8/28/2019,4,"Would recommend the poke bowls and sushi over the hot items. For the price and quality, you can't beat it. Plus they have a huge selection of foods, so it's great for groups! Casual place to go that won't break the bank for decent quality fish!"
3/26/2022,5,"Scrumtdileunchis , i was so good that I order at this place on a daily , THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE HAD IN A WHILE."
12/28/2018,5,"Whether you're into sushi or hot meals this place has something for everyone! You must try the milk tea! Stick with something simple like strawberry or mango flavor before venturing out to some of the other flavors. Be sure to pick up a punchcard for them because when you buy eight you get your ninth for free. They can also make a milk tea into a smoothie which is great on those really hot days. The food comes out quickly, and shows up as soon as it's ready, so it doesn't always come at the same time, but that also means it's nice and fresh when you get it. I have been to this location about 50 times and so far only had one instance when I ordered to go that it took a while.Parking can be a bit tricky at times. Tower Shops is not known for having readily available parking. I usually have to park at the end of Michael's and cross the grass area rather than sitting in front of the restaurant."
3/21/2018,4,Pretty good poke and sushi here. I've been a couple times and both times the food was good and came quickly. This time I got the Florida roll and the spicy yellowtail roll. Really great! It tasted fresh and had good flavor to them. I also decided to get some boba tea before I left and I'm so happy I did! I got the pineapple flavor green tea with strawberry boba. It was so refreshing and sooo tasty. I'd definitely like to make this a regular stop!
2/12/2022,2,Bento box: cold lo mein with undercooked chicken. Several times coming to this place and the last one today. Definitely I can't recommend.
9/10/2019,1,"Today I decided to go back to this location and try the pao pao shrimp udon bowl again. Again I had high expectations and AGAIN, I end up biting into shrimp tails!!! How the heck do you Leave the tails on a shrimp dish which is coated in sauce... can't even see the tails until they start grossly crunching in your teeth. What a huge disappointment. I thought my last review got the attention of someone from customer service & they even promised that they would send me a gift card. And made it seem like the shrimp should NOT have tails on them & as if I got unlucky the first time around. I guess this is the new norm. Yuuuuucccckkk. Never got the gift card. Same disappointing dish. I really used to love this place. My first review was 5 stars. UGH."
3/10/2022,4,This is such a good place but the manager here at night his name starts with a B is so rude!!!! Definitely suggest getting volcano roll !!!
2/6/2018,3,"I have been here twice and both times the lines were really long.  I thought that meant the food would be great, but in reality it is just okay.  The sushi is fresh and you can make your own combinations.  They have poke bowls and bubble tea as well.  Still, this is like a fast food chain joint.  It is generally loud and pretty packed, but the portions are good and the pricing is reasonable for sushi."
3/28/2018,4,"This is a gem in the tower shops plaza. A great place to go for lunch and dinner. Bento's has an inexpensive menu filled with variety.For 8-11$ you can get bowls, noodles, or even a bento box that has a little bit of everything with your entree. I get the spicy creamy sriracha chicken bento box. It is about 9.50 and it comes with a lot of food. A lot of good tasting food for a balanced meal. Along with the chicken, the box comes with green beans, ginger salad, rice, lo mein, and some small looking cereal things.I also got the chicken katsu rice bowl. It was fried too hard this time around, felt like it could be better. Definitely need sauce to eat it. In Orlando they charge you like 50 cents per sauce but here it's free. Eel sauce & yum yum are the go-to'sWill be back for either another bento box, sushi or a pokè bowl!"
5/17/2021,5,Bento always slays! It gets quite busy sometimes making a quick order take a while but it's worth the wait
12/8/2020,1,"Super disappointed. We first ordered at a Bento in Jacksonville and the delivery to our hotel was smooth and the food was awesome. So we were excited to see we could have the same at home with a little longer than usual drive.We gave it a try today and the food was a total let down. While the Jacksonville food had been fresh, plenty and delicious, this was the opposite.I ordered a regular ""create your own bento bowl""for pickup through seemless. I asked for half noodles and half salad as it was offered in the order. I only got salad. A tiny portion of the proteins and the avocado. And the wasabi topping was mixed in so that I thoroughly burned my mouth thinking I was biting into avocado. It looked like a carelessly thrown together side salad. Which left me completely hungry.My husband ordered the Pad thai and it looked completely different (with a red -ish sauce?) too and he said it was super hot (spicy) and not nearly as good as what we had in Jacksonville. Unfortunately a first and last kind of experience.Real bummer!"
10/15/2019,4,"Worth visiting. I went to Bento once for lunch with my co-workers and was impressed by several things. Lets get started. THE PLACE: locate din a shopping center, parking is a breeze. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and has a bit of a ""zen"" feeling to it. All was clean and many tables were available. THE FOOD: Its been a while since I went, so I cant really remember the name of my food, but I do remember enjoying it all, especially the ginger flavored salad!! Chai tea was also delicious. THE SERVICE: Service is very is quick- you make the line, place your order and the food is delivered to your table. Everyone whom I encountered was courteous and friendly."
9/12/2020,5,Food was great. The sauce for the krab wonton was delicious! Takeout was on time. Always enjoy bento no matter the location!
4/29/2021,1,I use to love coming here a few years ago so I was shocked at how downhill their quality of food has gotten when I ordered dinner from here last night. My husband's bento bowl barely had any sushi in it. They practically served him a bowl of sushi rice. My katsu meal was horrible. I couldn't eat it and the rice was overcooked. What a disappointment. I use to recommend this place to my friends all the time. I will go to Poke Ramen instead.
7/22/2018,5,"I love the sushi and sushi bowls at bento. I tried this place originally in Gainesville when I was in college and was so happy when they opened up in my own backyard. The menu selection is huge, both Chinese and Japanese dishes to choose from. My personal favorite is the create your own sushi bowl. It's basically like a sushi roll of your choice in a bowl: I get the raw salmon, breaded chicken, mushrooms, avocado, edamame, masago, cream cheese and the crispy fried onions over white rice. It comes with two sauces of your choosing - I go with the spicy mayo and ponzu sauce. It's delicious, fresh, fast and cheap. I love the idea of fast food sushi, rather than the traditional unhealthy fast food places. This place is great!"
11/24/2017,3,"I found out Bento Cafe is a chain at here. Florida has at least 4 stores. This one located on the University Avenue was very busy. It is heaven for young people to spend money due to very affordable price on the food.  The interior was decorated very nicely. Why they are average. The tables were not clean often. Even they are clean, they did not do a good job. Food is just average in comparison to many Asian Fusion place. We got beef udon noodle, poke bowl, spicy tuna roll, Florida roll and lavender jelly drink. The noodle and poke is build your own. Basically if you did not get your sauce right,it is on you. The food is average due to their selection to added on is limited by the the ingredients they have and number of items you can added into your bowl. The sushi rolls are not up to the standard. The best we have order just the lavender boba slush. This is the only memorable item."
7/8/2018,4,"Really great first experience at Bento! I ordered a milk tea smoothie that was pretty good; the only place in the area where milk tea smoothie is even an option! Boba was good consistency, although flavor was a bit watery. The sushi was great as well, and I loved that you can build your own box. Only downside to my experience was the more than average amount of gnats in the restaurant. Otherwise, good food!"
10/10/2017,5,"After hearing all the hype from my girlfriend about how this place was amazing when she was in Gainesville, we decided to try this place out, which we did this last Sunday after our Japanese classes at Morikami.Located in the Tower Shops shopping complex in Davie, Bento Cafe is a quick service restaurant. Upon walking in, you look at the menu which is placed at the entrance. The concept is that you order one of the many entrees at the menu (and there are many to choose from) and then you choose whether you want a rice bowl, noodle box or bento box. As this place is known for its bento boxes, I went with a bento box. This menu is extensive in that you can also make your own poke bowl and sushi rolls. I ordered the chicken sriracha garlic bento box and my girlfriend had the szechuan chicken bento box. Once our orders were placed, we sat down and awaited our food. As I ordered a miso soup ahead, that came out first. The miso soup was very brothy and was a very good beginning to the meal.Soon afterwards we received our bento boxes. I have had bento boxes in the past that contained 2-4 items. These boxes come with the entree, your choice of white or brown rice, lo mein, ginger salad and string beans with some pieces of fried wontons. I was wowed by the size of the boxes and wondered if I would be able to finish this box. Surprisingly, I was able to finish it all and loved it. The crunch and spiciness of the chicken sriracha mixed with all the other accompaniments was delicious and wowed me completely. Once finished, I was definitely full and satisfied. I could see why this restaurant gets so much hype; i think it's definitely worth it. Next time I may order a poke bowl, as now I have a hankering for one."
2/6/2022,2,"Don't go here if you're not expecting good take out. First time they lost my order. Second time no spicy mayo even though i paid for it, i want a refund because its dry with no sauce. Poor service"
9/26/2019,4,"I remember having Bento at least twice a month when I was in college in Gainesville. So excited that since then they have spread to a few more locations. We got the Spicy cream chicken (now called Pao Pao) brown rice bowl with veggies which was delicious and The Mongolian beef (plus shrimp) Bento box which was good but the ENTIRE thing was cold, it was very strange and the consensus on the noodles were that they tasted like mustard (which the tables on both sides of us agreed). My partner got the original milk tea with Boba and I got the taro milk tea smoothie with boba. Both were delicious and refreshing, loving the surprise of cold chewy boba in the drink. Besides cooked meals they have the options of sushi and Poke bowls which I look forward to coming back to try!"
11/30/2020,2,"Bento is a famous place with good taste But this one ‍ Our food was cold and the taste was bad too My friend got a side of veggies and I can tell that it wasn't fresh! It looks like if they just put the side of veggies in the microwave  The chicken was cold like undercooked.Oh, and I have to wait longer because my meal wasn't ready but they brought my friend's bowl first . Hopefully, they can improve their kitchen and service as well."
11/28/2017,4,"Had a poke craving and so glad I found this japanese asian fusion joint.Line was long and to the door, but moved fairly quickly. It's self serve.The menu is VAST with lots of choices which can be intimidating, but they were smart to have menus right at the back of the line, so you can go back and forth between what you want while you wait :)Got the poke bowl with 3 proteins (max). A good number of toppings, sauces. brown or white rice. Loved my poke bowl.Also tried family's chicken lo mein noodle bowl and tofu bento. Tofu and chicken was excellent as well. OVERALL: would come back."
7/2/2021,2,"I was undecided between 2 1/2 stars and 3. It wasn't nice. The brown rice was lumpy and pudding, the szechuan sauce was mediocre at best. I ordered it with beef and shrimp, beef was over cooked. It wasn't worth the $18 price tag with a small bottle of water. I make better Asian at home."
11/4/2017,3,"After running some errands in the tower shops my 7 yr old and I decided to grab lunch at Bento. For this trip, my daughter who loves rice opted for the chicken fried rice instead of the kid's bento box.    She got it with no onion or scallion and she said it was good. I got the make your own vegetable roll. I chose cucumber, avocado, mushroom and red onion.  I could barely see the avocado except in the last piece. It was okay. Nothing special. I had the stir fry veggies over brown rice. Not bad. It came out super fast as if it was all already ready. The rice was lukewarm. Last trip I had the fried avocado roll, it was okay.  More rice than avocado.  I did enjoy the noodles with veggies. The boba tea I had was too sweet. Both visits I felt rushed in ordering.  This trip I felt like the cashier was annoyed I wasn't ordering quick enough. The people next to us asked the floor person for napkins and she seemed annoyed she needed to fill them in. I had tried to ask her for a Togo box and she completely ignored me. The gentleman next to me asked her for me and she just pointed ""they are over there.""  I didn't see them because they blended in and considering I was at the table with my 7y old, it wouldn't have killed her to grab it for me. All in all, the food is okay. I haven't been impressed with service. Everything comes out as it is ready.  Will probably go back if I am in the tower shops, but wouldn't make a huge effort to do so."
6/24/2021,3,"Been there twice in the last year, and twice they were late opening because something was broken. Then they were out of 3 of the 4 things I ordered. Pad Thai was great, but...."
3/30/2018,5,"Great service and even better food. $15 is a bit pricey for the portion size but it's very friendly so it equals out. The environment is calm and a great place to enjoy friends. I ordered the Garlic Broccoli Shrimp Noodle Bowl with a Green Tea, Lychee Boba drink and I must say, I'm impressed with my choices. I'm extremely satisfied."
8/4/2021,3,"Like the food but the waiting is awful,. sitting in the table for my meal for 35 minutes ,. Looks like to go is first"
6/15/2020,4,Bento is popular around the tower shops and I can see why. I personally like the poke bowls and I'll usually get an unsweetened green tea. I actually liked the green tea so much that I now but it in bulk on Amazon. The atmosphere is pretty cool. It's usually always busy. I go here occasionally when I feel like having sushi. Also a very clean looking place. Oh and their boba tea is great too!
1/9/2022,2,"the workers were very nice and gave good recommendations when i asked what kind of chicken to order. although too many different recommendations was overwhelming. i place a takeout order and the food took VERY long to come out. I asked for no peppers in my noodle bowl, yet i still got an assortment of different colored peppers. my stomach was very upset after this meal as was i. their food could use more flavor. i do not think i will be coming back to bento however if i do hopefully next time will be better"
4/5/2019,5,"I used to go to Bento at least once a week in college, so when I heard that a Davie location was opening up, I was over joyed! Since it opened, this location has never disappointed! From the sushi to the hot meals, everything tastes just as good as it did in college, and their menu allows for a wide range of options, so you can always try something new! I often get sushi from Bento, and it's always fresh and affordable! I especially enjoy their Signature roll Red Dragon and the Classic roll Special Mexican! On the kitchen side, I always get the Szechuan Chicken Noodle Bowl with udon noodles and it is spicy and flavorful and never lets me down! I've also had the Mongolian and the Sweet and Sour, and both of those have a great flavor as well! Bento is the perfect asian fusion restaurant, and its wide variety of sushi, poke, and kitchen entrees enables everyone to find something they love!"
7/10/2021,3,The sushi was better than the regular Asian food. So I will stay away from that all dishes but sushi was good and have a good variety
7/26/2019,4,"One-stop shop for a fast, straightforward Asian meal.  The menu is a simple breakdown of entrees that are served as rice bowls, noodle bowls, and bento boxes ; along with options for poke and sushi.  There is a good mix of meat and vegetarian options (tofu based) as well - something for everyone!  The bento boxes had pretty standard sides, including salad with ginger sauce, lo mien noodles, rice, cooked vegetables, and this ""dessert"" consisting of an interesting combo of fried wonton and condensed milk.  The stir fry entree with tofu was good, with soy sauce-based flavor. You order at the counter, get a number, and seat yourself. Service is fast, staff is friendly, seating is numerous and spacious. Overall a good stop for a casual lunch/dinner!"
10/12/2020,1,"Let me start off by saying when I ordered from this place the first time I was blown away from how amazing their food was.But the past two times I've been there was a total disappointment. Any time this place is busy in the evening/ night the quality goes way down. It's expensive to eat here. It's a ""treat yourself"" type of restaurant when you get paid. But honestly, after the two times I went there and my $63.00 order was old, cold and inedible, I can't see myself going back. Not sure if I should just try another location or find another spot for Japanese style cuisine."
3/11/2020,4,"I've been craving  sushi and I enjoyed the veggie sushi which has avocado, carrot, asparagus,cucumber, scallion and cream cheese. I also ordered the fried avocado roll . The avocado roll is so popular sometimes they run out lol. Instead I ordered the chicken tempura roll which is good option too. One of the new item on the menu is their $4.00 chilled sesame noodles ! It is so delicious ! The sesame soy dressing And crispy carrot and zucchini strips makes it a good combo. oh man it's really good. They should have a small medium and large option because it really tastes good! As a side, I really like the  veggie spring rolls in chili sauce. I also enjoyed the Thai tea. They also have bubble tea options with many different flavors. This place I know gets busy, but it's pretty spacious. I know you have the option of delivery with door dash which I have done.  If in the area it's a good food spot. Parking around may sometimes be a hit or miss but there's plenty of parking all around."
12/30/2021,1,Ordered few items and one was missing. When called the restaurant about it instead of apologizing or showing some empathy their attitude is I must take that up with doordash for a refund. Wtf I was even willing to go there and pick it up cause now one person doesn't get dinner! Defeating the purpose of having paid more for using doordash. I would've rather returned everything for a full refund when I went out to get more food.  Management failure!
8/10/2019,5,"Cool place with great food! You go up and put your order in and then pick a table to sit at, so kind of like a fast food restaurant but this food definitely does not taste like that. I got the Wok Fried Rice with tofu - delicious! My friend thought it was a little plain spice-wise but that was perfect for me. My friend got their choose your own bowl and chose chow mein with sweet and sour tofu. She liked it - the only thing was the soy sauce was a little heavy on the noodles, but it was overall very tasty. While I loved the food, I discovered I wasn't a huge fan of the milk tea smoothie. The milk tea gave it an odd sweet aftertaste, but I'm glad I got to try something new anyway. Overall, delicious!"
4/21/2017,5,"If you went to the University of Florida, then Bento Cafe needs no introduction.A staple in the city of Gainesville, this lovely chain saved many students back in the day. Cough cough - myself included, but I know there are others who feel the same given the reviews for this location. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I heard that they expanded in South Florida. Admittedly I wish they had chosen Miami for its first location down here, given that this is over half an hour drive from me, but I will make due. I am only grateful that the closest location no longer is in Orlando, or worse still, heading up a bit more north to Gainesville and having to deal with the obnoxious lines.That being said, let's focus on this new star, because yes, my lovelies, this is what this place is. A STAR! The ambiance is modern, and to those who know Bento Cafe, be ready to be surprised. There is light, bright light, not the dark and dim so known to the locations in Gainesville. Thank goodness, too; this brings an air of liveliness to the place. Oh, and they have some canopy-looking things hanging from the ceiling, which are pretty cool, all the while still maintaining its roots and having some red all around, reminiscent of the location on Archer Road in Gainesville.Décor aside, my roommate and I headed up to Davie to eat dinner yesterday. It was about time, too. This need to go visit this location has been going strong for nearly a year now, and well, let me tell you that the food did not disappoint. We ordered two miso soups, a ginger salad, a sweet and sour chicken udon noodle bowl, a Szechuan chicken lo mein bowl, and two Boba teas. I don't think I have to tell you all that we ate like piggies.To start off with, I had a ginger salad. My first ever at any Bento by the way. It was fresh and it opened up my palette. After this, I had my miso soup; my roommate had his, too, and although I loved mine, he wanted more mushrooms in his. He then went on to eat his sweet and sour chicken udon noodle bowl, which he devoured, but I must agree with him. While good, it could have been great. Why? The sauce seemed a tad underwhelming; you could barely taste it.My dish, on the other hand, was amazing. It was also massive given all my appetizers. I now have leftovers for lunch and I am looking forward to enjoying them. As for the Boba teas, my roommate had a Thai one with pearls, while I had a strawberry blended ice one with strawberry boba. I must confess that this is my first one ever from Bento, and well, where have I been living? Under a rock?Something to note, however. These teas are very flavorful and thus may feel heavy. I ordered a regular-sized Boba tea and I couldn't finish it. I think they need Oompa-Loompa size ones for children like me, or perhaps better said, for people who cannot drink so much in one sitting. Current sizes available: regular and large; there is no small. Bring a small, people, pretty please.Eek, thinking about all this now makes me see that while this location is a blessing, it may also be a curse. Is there such a thing as too much love? Because if yes, I'm definitely feeling it towards Bento, and well, I see myself having to feel it with LA Fitness. Oh, the problems of being a foodie."
12/27/2021,1,Overpriced mall food. Worst beef I've ever had and Fried rice taste burnt. I would not recommend & will not be returning
5/5/2017,5,"I've been wanting to try out Bento in South Florida as I ate Bento for 4 years throughout my college career in Gainesville where they originated. To my surprise, this place is huge (yes, much bigger than any of the locations in Gainesville) and so well decorated! I was so use to a wait in Gainesville but this location holds plenty of tables and customers. I can say this Davie location is well lit and aesthetically pleasing.Due to it being a Saturday night I visited, they were very busy. Couldn't find any parking near the restaurant so I circled around and ended up parking further. They have a line set up that wraps around the entrance for longer waits. Standing in line, I realized it was moving very fast. Faster than I could get my order together. They had two cashiers taking orders. Once your order is taken, you are assigned a number, and foodrunners will deliver it to your table.Bento is known for their speed and affordability. Our food hit the table probably within 5-10 minutes of sitting down. Their foodrunners are also very kind. They will bring you sauces or anything else you need.As for their dishes, they all have incredible flavor. I've tried almost everything on the menu but for this location, I ordered the Stir Fry Udon Noodles, Bento Fried Rice, and nigiri sushi pieces. Sushi for $2 a piece!! Unheard of. You have to order two of the same to get that price so $4 but I've never had cheaper. The stir fry udon noodles were amazing but if you don't like the strong taste of ginger, you should ask them to leave it out. It ruins each bite. My son loved the bento fried rice. We still had plenty of leftovers to take home as the portions ran large.I am definitely a fan of this location and would like to come back soon!"
6/7/2019,4,Returned again today to bento. One of the fave spots in town with really decent Asian style     Today service was super fast We ordered a Poke Bowl and two sushi's Tex Mex and Volcano yum yum!!!!!Perfect place to grab a bite no matter the size of the party
4/11/2020,1,"HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!  Maria, the manger was absolutely  rude and liid to me when we went to pick up our to go order.  They had no wild greens to build a poke and said they called me to let me know, BS no calls on my phone.  It's Passover and can't have  rice or noodles.  Waiting 30+ minutes  for this.  UGH!!!AND their website said that everything we ordered was out of stock, whereas by phone it was fine.  First and LAST experience at BENTO!!!  NO stars!!!"
2/25/2017,5,"I always feel like I just give away 5 star reviews, but honestly it comes down to the quality of the food, the service and the price it costs. This place checked off each of those boxes. I'm sad there isn't one closer to me, but I can definitely say it's worth the drive. This concept I've been seeing a lot these days. Customizable rice bowls. Except this place doesn't charge extra for things like sauce and brown rice instead of white. Two of us did a build your own poké bowl. I was SO IMPRESSED! It's white rice, brown rice or mixed greens. Then you can choose up to 3 proteins and 4 mix ins. I was so indecisive because I'm used to being limited to 1 or 2 things. So bravo to this concept!! My friend customized her own bowl and my boyfriend got a sesame chicken bowl and a sushi roll. They both loved their meals. We also go steamed garlic edamame (GENIUS).The service was perfect. You order your food and then sit down and wait. But they are really good about coming around and checking if everything is okay or if you need anything else. We asked for some more sauces and they freely gave them to us. It's not close by, but I'll definitely find myself craving it and make the drive. Hopefully they expand further south in broward and into dade county."
5/16/2021,5,I ordered the crunch from the specialty menu and it was delicious. Juan the sushi chef not just brought it to me but also made a presentable tower.
10/23/2021,1,"I was dying of hunger so I stopped in. I ordered a chicken and shrimp wok fried rice. The rice was wet and mushy with too much soy sauce. You can literally taste the soy and the food lacks flavor. I also ordered a red curry shrimp, same thing no flavor full of sodium. No sure how this place stay busy cause it's not authentic Asian food. This is not a real Asian kitchen like it states. Not one Asian person in sight."
2/13/2019,5,"No where nearby comes close to the variety and quality of offerings at this Pan-Asian restaurant. Poke, along side pad thai, Szechuan style beef noodle soup, with the quality one would expect for each food item to be prepared in a restaurant catering to that specific cuisine. My colleagues and I love coming here for lunch. However, it's not a lunch to go to if you are going to be expected somewhere directly afterwards. First of all, the lines can get very long. Second, you'll probably be too full to concentrate."
5/17/2020,4,Love! Love! Love this place. This was the first bento to my knowledge in South Florida and before the opening at the Pembroke Pines location I would always go to this one. The food was always fresh and the staff made sure my meal was satisfying. I still go to this Bento when I'm in the area for old times sake but overall an amazing place for a sushi pick me up. There rice and noddle bowls are also very good. I would recommend the Spicy Cream or Sriracha Garlic rice bowls. I'm regards to rolls my ultimate favorite is the Florida Roll or Volcano roll.
1/29/2020,2,"The plates that we got were pretty decent in size but half of the plate was literally filled with rice. Me and my friend asked for triple side of avocado for each and we received not even half a small avocado. We had to ask for ""a side of avocado"" and it was like 4 small cubes. Besides that, the woman who brought us the plates started argued with us because I told her I ordered triple and avocado and ""it said double""The fish could have been better, I feel like it was not that fresh. My friend says that she has had better poke bowls before and we're sorry but we won't return."
12/31/2018,5,"This chain was opened in 2002 near the University of Florida and it soon became a student favorite. They have now expanded to 9 locations including this one in the Towers Shops in Davie. Parking is a bit of a pain but it's worth the hassle. The restaurant is nicely decorated with plenty of tables and a sushi bar at the end. You wait in line to place your order at the register and then they give you a number so they can find you to bring you your meal or take out order. The line was long but everything moved quickly. While I waited I checked out their menu. Choices include poke bowls, sushi, bento boxes, sides, soups, and bubble teas. I literally wanted to order $40 of food just for me but I had my choices narrowed down by the time I hit the register. My cashier was Narissa who was so sweet. Since it was my first time there I wanted to make sure I was going to like what I was ordering and she was so helpful. I decided on the chicken katsu in a bento box. Ckicken katsu is an Asian version of fried chicken. This one had a crispy sliced chicken breast covered in panko bread crumbs and served with a Japanese BBQ sauce. Bento boxes also include steamed white rice, crispy string beans, lo mein noodles, and ginger salad. I love a bento box. There is something so fun about all of those little compartments filled with delicious food. I always get one when I go to the Cornell Cafe at the Morikami Japanese museum in Delray Beach. Until now I had never found a local restaurant that served them. I also added a California roll and a tea to my order for $20. I wasn't sure what to order for a boba tea so I asked Narissa to pick her favorite. She chose for me a strawberry blended ice with popping strawberry boba. It was a sweet strawberry icy blend of heaven. When I sipped the straw the boba would hit my mouth and explode in more strawberry euphoria. The popping boba is 25 cent more. I loved my visit to Bento Asian Kitchen. I took my meal to go and once I got home all of the food I tried was great. The California roll was your standard roll but they gave a nice sized portion. The bento box was just like the ones I love at the museum and I can't wait to take my daughter to try one of the popping boba teas. This restaurant blows away another casual Asian restaurant in the same price point, Pei Wei. This restaurant has staff that is friendly and efficient unlike Pei Wei which is why I stopped going there. I just wish Bento Asian Kitchen was closer."
12/1/2016,5,"Ok, I'm fully a part of the Bento Cafe cult!! I've been dying to come here after seeing all the great reviews, but figured it wouldn't really happen anytime soon...but to my surprise, my dad said he would be at Costco and wanted to grab dinner here after!! Score!It was pretty busy when we arrived, but the line moved quickly, and it gave us time to study the menu til we reached a cashier.  They do a lot of ""Create Your Own"" things, so you should take some time to figure out how it works and what you want before getting to a cashier.  My dad went with a hot rice bowl - brown rice, sriracha garlic shrimp.  I tried a bite and was pretty impressed.  Nice size portion too, he barely finished it. I went with a create your own poke bowl - yes I should have gotten the greens as a base, but I was starving, so I did brown rice, tuna poke, salmon poke, fried tofu, avocado, wakame, cucumber, mushrooms with ponzu and spicy mayo!! Score! I LOVED it!It was pretty cold in here, so I ordered a miso soup as well, hoping it would come out first (it didnt) and an order of pork steamed dumplings, which also came out at the end.  The dipping sauce for the dumplings is more of a drizzle sauce (be warned) but these were great! I skipped a boba tea, and went with water instead, only to see they had a coke remix machine!! I think our check total was $28...which could have been cheaper if I didn't add on other things lol.  So, quite affordable.  Sure, it's probably not the best date night to order at the counter, but food is brought to your table, and the place was beautiful and clean.  I can't wait to come back! Question is, do I do a noodle soup? Do I make another poke bowl? Do I try their sushi! AHHHHH So yes.  Coke remix machine + affordable GOOD food, great atmosphere = 5 stars!"
4/9/2019,5,"Wow, I'm surprised i haven't reviewed this beloved place. My go-to spot for poke bowls and bento boxes. What I love most is that there is such a great variety, great for a big group..."
12/12/2018,4,"Always love coming to Bento Box! I originally had fallen in love with their bento boxes until I was introduced to the build your own Poke bowl.  The variations are endless and with the large you get such a good portion! I normally get two meats, tuna poke or spicy and imitation crab. For the additions I love pairing it with mango, avocados, edamame with cream cheese on the side. Toppings I do onions and tempura flakes with a side of poke soy sauce and spicy mayo! I wish they gave a little bit more for the portion price/size, I usually end up with a lot of rice left over. Needless, the flavors are great and always fresh! I also love their crab ragoons! Whatever sauce they use for the dip is phenomenal and usually end up putting some in my poke bowl! Highly recommended for a quick stop or sit down, I usually wait 5-10 mins max and togo is usually under 5 mins."
1/19/2020,3,"There's so much I need to  say about this place, so let's get started. It is located in a plaza with plenty of parking so it is very convenient. You do have to get in line to order which when we arrived had about 10 people ahead of us and we were ordering within 7 minutes so that was really nice. We ordered 2 sushi rolls and a red curry steak noodle bowl which cost us $40 so I found it a little more expensive than expected. Rolls were pretty amazing! So, why the 3 stars? Food came out rather quickly and we were with friends who also ordered more than 3 dishes so we were impressed with how fast food was made. However, we were missing a sushi roll. After 15 minutes I decided to approach the cashier and asked him for our roll. He went to check on it and they told him we already had it. Which we didn't. Then, the manager went to our table to ""verify"" we in fact did not have it. They didn't even apologize! They were just making sure  I didn't eat it and then went to get more, or at least that's how they made me feel and that is pretty unfortunate. After another 15 minutes, she came  back with it and said ""sorry, they don't know where it went"". All in all, great food but surely lacks that EXTRA customer satisfaction!"
12/30/2019,5,Loved it I have no complaints crispy tofu and yummy sriracha Garlic sauce I added vegetables and made a perfect Vegan Bowl!! I'm going to be there every week!!!!!! I can't wait to try more flavors.
11/2/2016,5,"10/29/2016 - LUNCHWhat a great concept! After looking at their extensive menu, at the line...which goes by pretty quickly, I decided to order the POKE BOWL.$9 one protein, $10 two proteins, $11 three proteins. The bottom of the bowl was between white or brown rice or greens, 4 sides and 2 sauces. I went with greens, on top the marinated spicy tuna, avocado, mango, edamame and peanuts, no sauce. You pay at the counter. They give you a number and you take a seat in the very spacious restaurant. Within 5 minutes or so, my food had arrived by a very friendly server. My friend ordered the Bento box, which was pretty large. I did get to try the green beans which were amazing. I am definitely coming back to Bento and ordering other items. Everything was fresh and plenty. You throw in a very customer friendly approach and you have a winner in my eyes!"
6/26/2017,5,"The food is awesome. Their poké bowls are so flavorful, and satisfying as well. The bento box is a good deal if you want to try a little bit of everything. I'd also recommend their kawaii rolls.Service usually very fast, and the staff is friendly. The place is kept neat and has a chill, fun vibe."
3/24/2019,4,It's a good way to have semi fast Japanese (?) food. Love the bento box. Has a nice assortment of items in one plate. Pretty quick but super busy!!
9/20/2018,3,"Bento helped me survive college at UF. It offered such a great array of Asian cuisines and became my comfort food shortly after opening. My orders were always simple. Beef Bulgogi Bento with extra spicy mayo OR Chirashi Don (with extra spicy mayo) AND a taro or almond milk tea with boba. When they started delivering, it was life changing, except delivery times were often REALLY LONG, so we just had to plan accordingly. So I was STOKED when I saw Bento had opened near my parents in Plantation and rushed to find out if it was the same great spot I knew and loved. Well, we couldn't get in to eat, so this review is based on their boba tea alone. We ordered two jasmine milk teas with boba. The jasmine was so strong it tasted like drinking perfume. The boba were kinda chalky in the center, as in undercooked. Definitely not delicately chewy like I'm used to in these drinks. So all told, these were bad. We reported it to the staff and they were quick to remedy the situation, whipping up two new Thai milk teas for us with fresh boba that were much better! I'm excited to get back home for a visit and eat here next time! I'm sure the rating will go up from there!"
1/10/2020,5,"I don't get to come here often, but when I do it is always consistently good food and service. I ordered the pad thai, which was extremely flavorful and a few rolls which were all good as well. Parking is always a little crowded since there are many businesses in the plaza, but they are not to blame. The seating is adequate for personal meetups and business chats as well. Glad they are opening a pembroke pines location near me, as I know i'd become a regular."
9/17/2016,5,"Been a fan since my early college days, visiting their locations in Gainesville and Orlando, and super happy they have finally opened one in South Florida!The thing I love about Bento Cafe -- options and customization! On the Asian Kitchen side of the menu, there are various hot meals you can order in forms of a rice bowl, a noodle bowl (lo mein, udon, or mini udon), or a bento box (yes, comes with other sides, pick this if you like more variety!). On the Sushi side, there are rolls and dons (donburi aka rice bowls) but there's the option to build your own too. I've never had the BYO option up north Bentos before so I like this new implementation, expanding your menu options to cater to your cravings. For the rice bowls, you can choose your own rice, 3 proteins, 4 toppings, and your sauces. Also, they have milk teas, green teas, and smoothies which are also customizable -- choose whether you want boba (large tapioca pearls), jellies, or popping boba). For those who really know me, I'm all about trying something new on the menu, but whenever I visited the Bento Cafes up north, I only had one craving: Spicy Cream. That is exactly what I got last Thursday night. Got the Spicy Cream shrimp on a bed of mini udon noodles. Comes with a side of garlic buttery green beans, which compliments the dish pretty well. Each flavor-packed bite brought nostalgia to my tastebuds, and despite how busy it was that evening, the wait from the long line was worth it! My honey got a Build Your Own poke bowl, which was super delish and fresh! They have A LOT of various options, even with proteins (not only just salmon and tuna but even poke versions and spicy versions, etc). By far the most extensive BYOB (build your own bowl) menu I've seen in SoFlo in regards to rice bowls and I am super excited to make my own bowl the next time I go back!For the teas, the honey got iced Thai tea and I got myself a honeydew milk tea boba with lychee jellies. I love their boba -- not too soft, not too chewy, just right!Great, fast service and super affordable. It was packed that night and it's only a soft opening on their very first week, so I'm glad Bento has a pretty good following. I'm also glad it's much closer now, because that means I can visit more often and try new dishes! OH, and I get the feeling this is the Red location because the decor was primarily red. Perhaps they'll open a Blue location soon? One can only hope! Heh, just a fan theory...Thanks for being a part of my college life, Bento Cafe, and I look forward to many more memories with you in present time with this new hot spot!"
5/1/2021,1,"The worst Bento I have ever been to. The wait times are outrageous for mediocre food. They have signs plastered everywhere saying they are ""understaffed"" yet there are at least 10 employees (not including in the kitchen) running around confused.  I ordered two bowls to go today, and my two friends eating in got their food first, and my food was still nowhere to be found 30 minutes later. I went up to ask, and they forgot about my order and just started making it when I asked. I get home and the bowl is about half filled what it normally is. Not only has the price increased on bowls, I waited nearly 45 minutes for a to go order in a not crowded restaurant, I got almost no food for 30 dollars. Save your money or order well in advance online."
10/13/2016,4,"Davie has suddenly become the nucleus for new restaurants.  The massive development of Tower Shops continues and Bento Cafe is the latest new tenant.  I really like the Chipolte-izing of fast casual restaurants.  This is a build your own type place for Asian cuisine.  Although you do not walk through an assembly line of ingredients like at Chipotle or Blaze, you do get to customize your order.  Being a fan of Poke from first trying it in Hawaii, I had to go for the Poke Bowl.  The options are truly endless, but I settled with Spicy Tuna & Spicy Salmon for my proteins and seaweed salad (wakame), dried seaweed (nori), and mango for my ingredients.  I had it on a salad instead of rice as I was trying to cut carbs.  For beverage I went with a large Taro flavored milk tea.The wait for the food was not long, the tea came out first and then the food shortly after.  The bowl was oh soooooo good!  I didn't like the salad underneath too much so maybe I'll try the rice.  You can also customize a ramen bowl which I am excited to try as well. The tea was as delicious as the ones at 545 Bahh Mi. I love me a good tapioca ball.  I've also had the Bento Box, I chose the Korean steak as the protein.  I found it to be a bit disappointing it was not spicy at all despite it being a spicy item on the menu.  Also I didn't like having noodles AND rice.  Once carb is probably enough.  The salad is eh and the sugar wonton desert sucks.  I would stick to the Poke bowls.Overall it was a great experience and I would come again.  My only advice would be to come earlier to beat the lunch rush as the line was pretty long when we  went."
10/19/2018,4,"Bento is my solid go-to in Davie for takeout or a quick lunch. They have customizable rice or noodle bowls, bento boxes, poke bowls, sushi, and lots of sides like edamame and veggie spring rolls. They also have a make-your-own boba tea which is pretty cool! The only things I don't love about Bento--They have freestyle coke machine, but no option for unsweetened iced tea which is my beverage of choice. -All the drink cups are one size. Fine for dining in when you can get a refill, but pretty small for the price if you're doing takeout. Their water cups are just as big or a little bigger than the cups you purchase for a drink. -There are up-charges for changing out veggies. For example, I usually get the orange chicken with snow peas and green beans instead of peppers, and there is $1 charge for each vegetable that I add even though I'm taking away the original vegetable it comes with. I wish substitutions were not extra because my $9 bowl can turn into a $13 bowl if I'm adding veggies and extra sauce. Other than that, I love Bento. The quality of the food is great for the price, the portions are perfect, and service has always been fast and friendly for me. Actually, surprisingly friendly staff for a counter service restaurant. Sometimes the lines are long, but they move quickly, and it's totally worth it!"
9/11/2016,5,"Bento Group expands to South Florida! The fresh fast food sushi and Asian fusion hot spot opens in the Trader Joe's shopping plaza near Nova, Tower Shops.You order food at the counter, from the hot food menu or the sushi menu. They have bento boxes, noodle and rice bowls, Poke bowls, sushi rolls and bowls... lots to choose from!I went with my usual favorite, the tuna + salmon don, which is a sushi bowl. They give a huge portion of sashimi and rice, and it's topped with avocado and spicy mayo. Bento also has a list of boba tea/smoothie/slush and flavors. I got the Jasmine milk tea with boba. I personally don't like flavor in my milk tea, but they offer taro, vanilla, Thai tea, and many other flavors. The boba is soft and sweet to taste.Service is fast and servers walk around tending to tables' needs, but the atmosphere is casual and self seating. Pro-tip: call ahead to pick up your order and skim the line!"
11/6/2018,4,"Fast food Asian fusion cafe.  A lot of tasty options here to choose from depending on what you are in the mood for.  There must have been 100 people in this restaurant and despite that, i must say that the service was pretty quick. Parking is a pain during lunch, so just go ahead and park across over by Office Depot area.I ordered the Bento Fried Rice and the portion was decent and food itself had lots of flavor. I think next time, i'm going with the Poke as everyone is telling me to try that next.I must say, the bathrooms were very clean and the soda fountain area was very neatly organized."
11/13/2018,5,Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi is one of my favorites spots to visit whenever I'm in the Davie area. If it means stopping in for some Lychee Green Tea Bubble Tea w Tapioca or actually sitting down to enjoy my meal then I'm there. My bf actually dislikes how much I enjoy this place but for some reason I'm always coming back. Bento is typically a line-out-the-door (we hope you know your order by the time you get to the register) kinda place. That has to tell you something about a place when it's constantly packed 25/8. You may feel deterred to come in and see quite a lengthy line but I promise they work through that line as quickly as possible. There's typically always 3-4 people working the cash register so don't worry about why 1-2 people are taking care of a line of 15+ people lol. (They have it covered)As I said I typically order a Sm Lychee Green Tea bubble tea with Tapioca and then a Florida Roll with (NO cream cheese) . This time that I visited I ordered:- Miso Soup- Lychee Green Tea bubble tea w Tapioca- Florida roll- Chicken Teriyaki BowlEverything came up to about $24 and the food got to the table almost minutes after we chose a spot and got drinks and utensils. I recommend anyone who wants a tasty lunch to visit!
9/27/2018,5,"I LOVE BENTOS!!! I swear I've been to several I mean several of sushi spots in both Orlando and Miami and I always come back to Bentos. Bentos is one of my favorite sushi spots. Gotta love them.My favorite rolls of all time are The Special Mexican and the Mount Fuji rolls. You have the option to order a half or full roll if you're feeling reall hungry. The prices are always reasonable too and the service is fast as well. I've  been to other fancy high end sushi places and nothing beats Bentos honestly, hands down. I definitely recommend this spot!"
8/21/2020,5,SO GASSSSSSSS this was my first time trying boba tea and It was love at first sight. The texture is amazing and the tea is delicious. The order came in fast too. The poke bowls r a rlly good size (mini in the photo) and they r fresh asf. My total was $12.86 which is SO GOOD for poke and boba tea. Every other place I've been to is overpriced. 173829201/10 this place has my heart
9/6/2021,1,Pictures are deceiving. I ordered the Mongolian beef bento box with white rice. $18 for 5 or 6 pieces of bland steak. I could have went to Pei Wei for almost half the price and got better flavor. Complete waste of money. Never again.
12/1/2019,4,"I've been a fan of Bento ever since college back at UF. I was so excited to see that they had a location in Davie. They are planning to open up a spot in Pembroke Pines near the Publix on Pines and Palm! My fave dish here is the Pao Pao Chicken (battered, fried chicken in sweet and sour + spicy mayo sauce). I like it in a bowl of rice or udon noodles or in the Bento box. Most things here are pretty satisfying depending on if you like savory versus sweet dishes. Service is decent and pretty fast."
10/28/2018,3,"Being in Bento 3 times.We got there around 9PM and ordered there was no lines!While I went to the bathroom the food was already out, they are super fast, but its the second time I come over that they forget an item we ordered!We asked for two ordes of the Rangoons, we got one and they forgot about the other one, 10 minutes later we stand up to go complain about it, and the girl who was bringing the food came over our table and asked if we were missing a order of the Rangoons and we said yes we are, 5 minutes later we got it!I ordered the Noodle Bowl, vegetable Stir Fry with chicken, was awesome their food is pretty good and no complaints about it! They just have to be a little more attentive on what you ordered, being there 3 times and they forgot a item in two different occasions!"
4/10/2019,5,"So yummy My mom and I were always eye-ing this place but each time the line was crazy, but today it was kind of slow so we went in. The menu isnt hard but you have a lot of choices and options. The cashier was so sweet and helpful, told her it was our first time so she explained some of the toppings to us. We got two mini poke bowls, my mom with tuna and mines with salmon they filled us up! Even the drinks are good, I hate washing my food down with soda and here you can get beer, rice wine, tea, and so much more. Also the cashier let me get my tea without boba, wooohoo!"
12/12/2018,2,"Very disappointing. I was in the area shopping and needed to get a quick lunch. I looked up Yelp reviews,  and this seemed like a good place to try. It's a medium sized clean location where the food is fresh and the customer service is great. The menu is huge - there are so many choices that as a first timer, it was a bit overwhelming.  You have to study the menu before you order unless you are familiar with it....which allows you to try new things each time. I decided on a shrimp tempura appetizer, and a  bento box with white rice and spicy bulgogi (all bento boxes come with ginger salad, lo mein, green beans and a small dessert of a few pieces of  fried won tons with a sweet sauce over it) . You get a number and sit down and a runner brings you your order when it's done . All of that should add up to a great experience.If only the food were as good. The shrimp tempura consisted of 4 ""big"" shrimp with dipping sauce for $7.99. Unfortunately there was  too much batter that made the shrimp seem big, and they tasted only like the oil they were fried in ( yuck - that needed to be changed). The dipping sauce was not the ""usual"" but seemed more vinegar than soy sauce base.I usually love spicy bulgogi, (spicy marinated beef, scallion and onion) $11.99,  but I did not like their version. It had a strange aftertaste - maybe hoisan sauce? Not sure but I did not care for it. The white rice was hot and good, but the lo mein was cold,  tasteless and dry. The green beans were good, but barely warm. The ginger salad was ok,  but fried won tons with the sweet  sauce were not.So for $22, I really didn't think it was worth it. I will say there are many things to try, and maybe if the sides had been good I would be more eager to try again. And maybe I still will - but with so many Asian  restaurants around, the fact that the shrimp and beef were both not good makes me think probably not."
6/7/2018,4,"Bento Café, welcome to South Florida! Going to school in Gainesville Bento was my no. 1 spot to go for fast casual sushi. When I heard they opened close to my neck of the woods I had to make it out there.YUM! Still just as good as I remember it with friendly and fast service, too.From poke bowls to sushi rolls, their menu is packed with deliciousness. I got the chirashi bowl which was filled with fresh sashimi over a bed of sushi rice. This is a fast casual spot so you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.They offer a make your own poke bowl which is great too. My dining mate added mango to their salmon and tuna poke and it was most definitely photo worthy. Pricing here is on point. Portions are generous for the price too which makes me heart eye emoji the heck out of bento. The parking is plentiful too, although this plaza does get hella busy so you may need to walk a little. Bento, I'm so happy you made your way from Gainesville to Davie. Welcome!"
9/12/2016,5,"Going to college in Florida, everyone who's gone to UF or even UCF should have some recollection of visiting Bento Cafe at least once in their life (and if not, you're missing out). Being here for optometry rotations, I was ecstatic knowing they'd be opening relatively close to my family's house. Like all the other locations, decor is a modern Asian feel with their signature red theme (most locations are either red or blue). Cool music playing and plenty of seating. It's located within a plaza so there is ample parking spaces. Bento Cafe offers a delicious variety of Asian food and sushi alongside a boba tea bar. Between every location, a few menu items are different and/or absent, but the favorites always remain. If you crave hot food, my personal recommendations include beef bulgogi, curry katsu, Mongolian steak, and my ultimate favorite: spicy cream. For these dishes, you choose the entree and then you can pick between a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or a bento box (comes with different sides: lo mein, salad, string beans, and rice). For sushi, my personal recommendations include the special Mexican, mt. Fuji, hot lava, and Miami roll. DON'T FORGET THE SPICY MAYO. Their recipe is unique and packs a lot of flavor unlike most other restaurants in the area. Boba is delicious and I always favor taro, matcha, strawberry, mango, (and even a combo strawberry mango), etc. All is good!Dishes range from $4-$10 which is why this place is a STEAL. For what it's worth, this place is BOMB, super affordable, and a cool place to hang out."
9/21/2019,5,"I can't believe I haven't done a review for this fusion spot yet. Originally was introduced to Bento in downtown Orlando. This spot is modern, clean, and has a nice relaxed environment. The service is fast and efficient. Order your food at the counter and have it brought to your table. I order the same thing here all the time which is the pao pao chicken with white rice in a bowl. My all time favorite dish. I've tried a few other dishes and I can't order anything else. The staff is very friendly, plenty of seating, and you may need to park a few ways since it's always busy. The sushi isn't bad, wasn't a fan of the boba tea, and they have an array of drinks. Walk over a little after you finish your entree to phenomenal ice cream and bake shop for some dessert."
11/16/2019,4,"This was my first time hearing about or patronizing this restaurant. I stopped in with a friend for an early dinner, & although the establishment looks like a typical chain restaurant, I was impressed with the quality and taste of the food. The menu has quite a few options & I was happy to see a variety of sushi options on the menu. I ordered a Mongolian beef white rice bowl & a sushi box with 4 Mt Fugi rolls. My rice bowl was delivered to my table very quickly & my sushi followed awhile after but I could tell there was a wait for sushi based on the customers lined up in front of the station who weren't dinning in. Both were very tasty. Portion size fit the pricing. My only complaint was the restaurant was uncomfortably cold to an extreme I've never experienced before. It being chilly outside did not make it any better. Tables come with chopsticks, however there are no other silverware, napkins or condiments available which is a slight inconvenience. Especially with the food being delivered to the table, however there is a station in the back corner of the restaurant where all these items can be found. I would patronize this restaurant again."
6/13/2018,4,"This place is quite the gem, it's a little difficult to get to but it's total worth it. It's definitely your money's worth and it's not overly expensive!I ordered the garlic chicken broccoli bento & sautéed mixed vegetables with chicken an green tea passionfruit boba tea. The bentos were amazing, flavorful and a good amount I was very happy with it. As for the boba tea, a bit disappointed. The tea was very bitter, I'm not sure if it was a new batch, the tapioca was small and not great in texture. Can probably get boba tea somewhere else for a better price and flavor. Besides that, there was a long line which I though would take forever but it was so quick. Great customer service. I can not wait to come back and try more bento boxes!!"
9/24/2016,5,"Recently opened up in the same plaza as Bestbuy.  As a Asian from Los Angeles who had numerous good options, Bento has quality options.Since its new, it does get quite busy with a long line to order. I had the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. It was surprisingly good, almost on the same level as Beef Noodle Soup (Niu Rou Mian) in LA. Order it with the mini Udon noodles.I also had a make your own Pokebowl. With the option of brown rice or white rice, or vegetable bottom. The option for 3 proteins is great. The quality of the fish was superb, flavored really well, and super soft and fresh. The Salmon poke, Tuna poke and marinated salmon were great options."
9/20/2016,5,"So exciiiiiited to have a Bento in SoFlo! The long awaited opening of this location is finally over. It's located right off of 595 in Davie in the Tower Shoppes newest building along with other businesses new to the plaza. It's a 'wait in line to order and they'll bring your food and drinks to you' type restaurant, which from a business POV is probably a smarter choice to get people in and out quicker, but it sucks when the line can be out the door. My Bento loving bf and I ordered the beef bulgogi rice bowl along with the Crunch sushi roll. Both were really yummy  no complaints there. I'm in a miso soup phase, so there was also an order of that and I was recommended to try the jasmine milk tea by a friend - both were also delish! I didn't get it with the boba b/c it was just too sweet. The wait time for the food wasn't long at all considering the amount of customers and the ambience of the place was very chic and modern. Service was also very friendly. Nonetheless, we will definitely return."
4/15/2018,4,My first visitIt could be a little intimidating not understanding everything thing on the menu. The food was excellent. It was delivered quickly and hot. We were with my grandson who made suggestionsWe will return.
11/17/2018,4,"Everything was delicious and boy the quantity of food was perfection. If, you're getting the teriyaki chicken get the extra sauce as well. It really tops off your dish. The restaurant was really busy but they had a whole lot of cashiers to cash people out so the wait time wasn't long. The only downfall is the location town shops are  busy on the weekend so it's kind of hectic to exit to get to back onto the main road. The upside the smoothies are delicious or should I say the ice smoothies are great I had a passion fruit smoothie with strawberry boba.   Now that was the piece de resistance. I would just come back for that alone. Their pumpkin spice wontons were delicious too but $5 for the quanity they give is not worth it they should bring the piece down."
2/16/2020,4,"This is my favorite sushi place. If you're not up for  rolls or sashimi, choose a poke bowl or soup. Bento has a wide selection for your Asian cravings.Bento in Davie gets my ""thumbs up!"""
12/15/2018,5,"I used to go here and order something different off the menu and always thought that it was just ""ok"". My friend told me to try the spicy cream/pow pow dish and it changed my life!! Seriously I've been going and ordering the spicy cream shrimp with udon noodles taking out the string beans and peppers and adding broccoli and it's soooo delicious! I also order a Mexican roll to share with my partner and I love it so much. I also tried the spicy cream with chicken and it's soooo delicious. It's always slammed here and now I know."
8/18/2018,5,Holy delicious Batman. This was my first bento box and I was definitely happy with the experience. The food came out really quick and they serve sake which is amazing!!I've eaten at the Orlando one that is more of a sit down with a server restaurant. Here you place your order at the counter sit down and it's delivered. I Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fresh bite of Asian fusion!
10/14/2016,5,"We're new to the area so scoping out new places is a priority, so Bento Cafe was near the top of the list given the reviews. We came in for dinner on a weeknight and I'll start by saying long lines are usually my kryptonite but I pushed through and it wasn't half as bad as some other fast casual places. In fact, the line moved rather quickly plus it allowed me some time to figure out what to order because their menu does offer quite a variety - something for literally everyone.Our order consisted of fried pork dumplings, a poke bowl (love the ability to customize!), and beef bulgogi with rice and 2 drinks which cost around $30. Slightly more than other similar type concept restaurants but the quality and amount of food was a good value -- my husband saved the second half of his meal since there was enough for lunch the next day. Bonus is that the staff was pleasant and efficient. If given the option to order ahead and pickup I always do, and thankfully they offer this, so it's likely to be in our rotation."
7/27/2018,3,"This is a nice, open, bright restaurant. After ordering at the front, you can take your number to a table and wait a very short time for your meal! The menu itself is expansive, with hot meals on one side including stir-frys, fried tempura meals, even soups, and a sushi menu on the back. The best part on the menu, if you want to try a little of everything, is one of the bento meals. You can choose a protein and a cooking style, that comes with a bright ginger salad, soba noodles, rice, and some sweet wonton chips. It was a great sample of everything.The ginger chicken I got was coated in a delicious, not heavy ginger sauce, while the soba noodles were unfortunately lukewarm but still tasted okay. Not much flavor. The miso soup I ordered along with the meal was delicious and hot!Come here for a fast, flavorful cheaper meal!"
5/29/2020,5,"First time order, was fresh hot and delivered. Most of all Delicious. Pao pao undon noodle bowl with chicken. Ok I should also mention the online ordering wasn't too hard to navigate and process."
2/13/2021,5,"Great spot for on the go or to sit down. They have a big menu to choose from, which seems overwhelming but honestly everything I've gotten here is so good. I love how they offer both 4piece & 8piece sushi rolls. The Pao Pao spicy cream chicken is my absolute favorite! Bento is a must try because you'll love it!"
7/25/2021,5,This is actually from my kid: I like the chicken because it was crispy and the sweet hard noodles and I loved the rice in my box.
8/18/2018,5,"I have been to the Bentos in Orlando and I am happy that the quality of this location was the same.Good atmosphere, very reasonably priced food and good service. I barely had time to fill a water cup before my order was delivered to my table.Bento boxes are the way to go. I love the sriracha garlic chicken and it was nice that they offer cold sake on the side. I haven't had a bad experience at Bentos yet (especially with Bento boxes)!I love this place."
9/13/2019,5,"Wow just wow. A friend of mine has been telling me about Bento box for what seems like months now and I have finally experienced it for myself. Step aside Pei Wei there is a new sheriff in town. We arrived early based on her recommendation to beat the lunch rush and I'm glad that we did because the place was very busy by the time we left. The menu is quite large and as a first time or a little overwhelming. I figured since I was at Bento box I should have a Bento box. Typically I go with something like a Kung pao or general tsos. but my friend recommended the pao pao which is like a creamy kung pao, it was addicting! My bento box had brown rice, chicken, lo mein noodles, sautéed string beans, a small salad with ginger dressing, and some crispy cinnamon sugar fried wontons. There was so much food! I was so happy! Everything tasted delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try one of the many other offerings that they have. Note I did Take a peek at the tuna poke bowl and it looked super fresh and big portions. There is one of these coming to Pembroke Pines in my area and I cannot wait!"
10/12/2018,5,"The food here is always great! It's normally always really busy, so now whenever I'm craving sushi I always call ahead and it's typically ready in 10 mins. Their sushi combination box is my favorite because it's very filling and affordable especially for sushi which I think is sort of pricey. It comes with 8 pieces of California roll and 4 pieces of 2 different types of speciality roll (they have a big list to choose from) it also comes with some sort of onion and cucumber side which is yum! The chicken katsu noodle bowl with the curry red sauce is my go-to when I don't get sushi. It's delicious. The fried wontons are great too!"
4/11/2018,4,First time having dinner here and can say for a quick bit of Asian food this place was great. I had ordered the Shrimp pad tai without peanut and a 4 count of their Special Mexican rolls. The pad tai was amazing the sushi was okay. I also ordered the pineapple green tea which I wasn't a fan of. The tea seemed prepackaged and the pineapple flavoring was like a gel at the bottom of the cup. No amount of mixing infused the tea and pineapple flavoring. Place was really clean. Lovely helpful staff. Good affordable pricing.
12/28/2017,4,"If you're in Tower Shops, enjoy Japanese ""fast food,"" and can find a parking space, you should try Bento. If you're like me and find the huge ""build your own"" stir fry, noodle bowls, sushi, or poke bowls just too much on your first or second visit, go with one of the set menu items. I don't think you'll be disappointed. These ingredients go together and will be well prepared. I've read some of the marginal reviews of Bento, and think many of them are due to the patron's ingredients choices, rather than Bento. Sometimes people just pick a bad combination of ingredients. That said, I agree that the staff could be friendlier. Knowing I'm not a chef, I've chosen a tuna poke bowl and a salmon poke bowl. I really love the fresh and cold fish, spicy mayo, avocado, cucumber, masago, and mango combined with the warm rice. Delish!"
1/23/2021,1,Waiting for and order we placed inside for takeout and the people that order for eat it get service first?!? Why when we were in line first? Not great customer service and cooks are just playing around instead of doing their job of getting people out of here!
12/27/2017,2,"FAST FOOD: As much as I like the concept of this contemporary bento style local chain serving Pan-Asian cuisine in my neighborhood (and believe me i gave this place a chance and visited 3 times to ensure my review is fair), this is a prepackaged FAST FOOD, nothing else. The food lacks flavor and character. In a very serious way. Very bland, it is not your flavorful pan-Asian fare you are expecting. Not as advertised either. The place certainly brings a lot of traffic especially of a younger age simply because there isn't any contemporary Asian cuisines in the area, it's located next to shopping plaza, and because it was originally open for hungry college students. Location, location, and novelty. Not a bad idea.WE TRIED: We have tried their edamame, garlic adamae, pad thai noodle bowl, rice bowls, Surf n' Turf with chicken and spicy tuna, wakame, cucumber and avocado. Nothing extraordinary. No flavor at all in my opinion. My son couldn't even finish his dumplings saying it didn't taste as good as in other places. When we tried it again during our following visit i noticed it was out of the box. So yes, frozen tasteless boiled dumplings being served here. I wasn't impressed with my sushi either. Only 10 types of sushi offered here, and I believe we tried about 5...not impressed. Mainstream, tasteless. Crowd-oriented, the food has to be served bento-style...quickly, and you get a tasteless Asian-style food which is not freshly made. SUMMARY: Good bento-style fast food concept, but when the food is bland and the brand fails to deliver on high quality fresh Asian food, something is wrong with that picture. My third trip sealed the deal. The place has an audience in all 9 locations, but I don't fit in this audience. I enjoy a good Asian food, this place doesn't do it for me."
2/18/2021,2,"Mediocre sushi, long waits, and poor customer service.  Called to place an order. They picked up. Placed me on hold.  12 minutes later I had driven there, parked, walked in, waited for cashier, and showed him I was still on hold 14 minutes later, and there was only 3 customer in the place. He either forgot I was on hold, or didn't care. So I waited 20 minutes for 2 sushi rolls.Gave it another shot a few weeks later, ordered on line, had items delivered only to find the Boba tea I ordered for my daughter was made wrong. No Boba. That was the whole reason she wanted it so she didn't drink it. I called. Guy said sorry I will comp it for you next time you order. OK. Today I called the store to see if he was there. Said I was coming in for the drink. Girl on phone said I go ahead come in, we wont charge you for it. I go. They charge me for $4 for the drink and said well we didn't charge you for the Boba. Um, that is not what I was promised.  Your customer service sucks. You are slow. Sushi is just OK.  Taking my business elsewhere."
3/26/2018,5,"Bento is an amazing place to enjoy lunch with some friends on the weekends. If you're looking for sushi, rice bowls or other Asian goodness then you're in luck.As you enter be sure to grab a menu so you can decide what to get before you get to the cashier. The menu has a ton of options, priced well. It seems like most people go for the sushi however there are plenty of other options. I opted for the red curry rice bowl. Drinks include soda and also alcoholic beverages such as bottled beer and sake. There's also boba tea available if you're interested (which you are). The food took about 5-10 minutes to arrive but that time can definitely vary based on your meal. Everything was great - the rice was cooked properly, the red curry was tasty and the chicken pieces, while thinner than I was expecting, were suffice. Portion sizes are fair and I noticed the rice bowls are a bit larger than other entrees.The venue is fairly large with many tables to choose from, but keep in mind they do get very busy around and after lunch so larger groups may find it difficult to sit together. Overall, this will serve your Japanese and Thai cravings with quality meals and proves to be a solid lunch contender."
10/4/2017,4,"I can never say no to poke. After binging on poke in Hawaii I returned back home to find myself longing for that sweet tuna. Thankfully I live a few short minutes from Bento - and while my experience in Orlando was less than stellar, I tried the bowls - rather than the sushi - and I found my new jam.Sure the sushi is cool - but the poke bowls are where the party is at! I will mention that for first timers, it's a super overwhelming menu. There's so many toppings and options. I've ordered the same thing every single time in paralyzing fear of trying to make a new decision.The first time I went with poke bowl and asked the cashier for recommendations - she basically just rattles off everything in the additions. When I asked her her favorites on sauces she once again just rattled off a bunch of he options - couldn't offer a personal recommendation? Meh. I figured it out.Tuna bowl. seaweed. edamame tempora flakes. extra poke sauce. spicy mayo. And then I rotate one more - I've tried the mango and it was a nice sweet addition.I've tried a variety of the hot apps as well. While good, they pale in comparison to the bowl. So yea, get the bowl. It's delicious.Place is nice, modern...with an upbeat playlist and a good amount of seating plus a sushi bar to sit at."
12/22/2017,4,"I got the noodle bowl with teriyaki chicken. If your looking for a meal you can either get a bento box or a bowl. If you want variety, I recommend getting the bento box and if your looking for a simple meal get the bowl. You can also choose which sauces you want in the bowl. The food is good and the teriyaki chicken wasn't dry. The prices ranged from $9-13 depending on what you get. In my opinion, I don't think it is worth it for the amount of chicken and noodles that they give you in a bowl. They have a friendly and hardworking staff. I will definitely come here again to try the bento box and the drinks!"
1/22/2018,4,I've come to Bento Cafe a few times and each of those times the food and service has been fantastic. Since going here I've been craving Poke bowls constantly. This was actually my first experience trying Poke and it was phenomenal. We normally go during the week and it's usually not packed so we would walk right to the register to order. Unfortunately this doesn't give me enough time to figure out what I want to eat haha. So I chose build your own Poke bowls each time so I can't really say which specific meal stood out. I can say that each time the food was fantastic. From the seasoning put into the food and the fish itself you can tell it's fresh. You can really tell they really care about the quality of the food that you order and as I said the service is always great. Everyone that works there always has a smile on their face and are working in a fast pace. Definitely have to go back soon to try more of the food they have to offer. Should also try their pre made Poke bowls and mention them in my review. If you're in a mood for Poke bowls then you should definitely drive to Bento Cafe. The food is great and the service is great. Just a great environment to be around.
9/14/2020,2,"We usually love this place, we always come here. However, today was horrible. We ordered two hours prior, specifically we asked to have the order ready by 7pm, we get here and our order according to them never came through. Even though we were charged and we had a confirmation for the order. So they said they would make it, while waiting for the food we spoke to the manager, Mani (according to him) and he does not even offer a discount for the mix up, until we brought it up. Very disappointing!"
6/13/2020,5,"I absolutely adore Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi!! Eventually I will go to the brick and mortar location but I have been wearing them out with my deliveries the past few months. Everything here is outstanding. Fresh ingredients in delicious dishes are made to order with care. I love love love their poke bowls. You get to select your size and every element that goes into them. My favorites so far are the spicy tuna and the spicy tofu- delicious! The chilled sesame noodle are great on their own so I'll get them as an appetizer sometimes. I really like that you can get a smaller version of sushi rolls there. You get to choose between a small (4 pieces) or a large (8 pieces). This has let me try so many of their rolls I love it! Their version of a Japanese Bagel roll is on point. The smoked salmon is so delicate, paired nicely with avocado and scallions- I always get a small of this one. Still working my way through all the sushi rolls. And don't forget the kimchi! They also have great sauces you can order on the side. I'm addicted to the spicy kobachi and spicy mayo. Every thing I've had here has been really really good. Can't wait to come meet you in person Bento!!"
12/14/2017,5,"Bentos is one of my go to spots. I am so glad they opened one near my house. I am usually here every week. I love the customer service, the employees are quick and nice. I usually order the white rice bowl with Katsu chicken or teriyaki steak with white rice. I also ordered the bento box before and it was just as great. It's inexpensive and definitely a great hangout spot as well."
1/17/2020,4,"This is more or less your typical Asian fusion restaurant that's aimed at a younger crowd. If you are looking for more traditional Asian food then you might be disappointed.The quality of the food is pretty solid. Don't expect to be blown away by the quality but if you are looking for a fast and relatively inexpensive ( for SoFlo) meal then this is your place. They have a pretty large menu but I usually end up getting one of their rice or udon bowls. The quantity is a little on the smaller side for me but I also eat a lot lol.The staff are all very nice as well. I've been here many times over the last few years and I've never had any issues with the staff. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the place."
11/12/2017,4,"Ooh the things I'd do for some bomb sushi.. including driving an hour away and getting lost. I've heard of nothing but great things from BentoCafe..after seeing pictures upon pictures on a yelp I knew I had to try this place out. Definitely did not disappoint! Bento Cafe is very modern and upbeat atmosphere. They have a large sitting area and also a sushi bar where you can sit. We came right before the rush so it was very good timing before noon is good. You go through the line, place an order, they give you a number, you sit and wait...and they bring your food to you. We didn't have to wait very long as the service is pretty quick. The sushi was very fresh and tightly rolled so it didn't break apart as you picked it up.  I ordered the Florida roll, and the riceless kawaii roll. The kawaii resembled more like a spring roll but securely still tasty. Christine M. ordered the spicy cream chicken over rice which looked and smelled yum.  There was so much in a bowl that even the two of us foodies could not finish. I don't know if it was our welcoming aura or our infectious smiles but with all the empty tables around us everyone sat next to us. As if all the food we ordered was not enough, before we left we somehow ended up back in the line ordering drinks to go. With so many choices I ended up going to my go to drink: mango tea.  Super refreshing and not too strong like other places. Definitely come get this place out if your in the area."
9/21/2019,5,"Love Bento! Their bento box, Sushi, & bowl is so delicious! Their service is also very fast and the place isn't expensive their prices are really good. Their menu has a great selection of choices. I got their bento box with Sriracha chicken it comes with white or brown rice but I asked for salad instead of the rice. I would definitely recommend this place if you want something fast and tasty! Can't wait to go back and have their sushi."
2/13/2020,5,"We found Bento because of Door Dash. In one week, we've had them twice. Son 1st had Mongolian Bento Box and Pork Rolls. Loved it. Ordered today because of Milk tea (lychee for me. Honeydew for son). Sooooo good!!!! Also got poke bowl. Very good. I got teriyaki steak Bento box. Amazing!!!!! So tender. So fullllllll. A fantastic find. We'll definitely have them again."
6/10/2019,4,"I'm new to South Florida, and even though this restaurant is a chain, it's still local to Florida, and I've never heard of it until my sister took me. It's set up as a quick-eats type of day place. Stand in line, place your order, take a number to place on your table, and wait for them to bring you your food. I was impressed with the huge selection that they have on their menu. This is an Asian fusion with everything from sushi to Kung Pao to coconut curry, with your choice of protein, including tofu.  I ordered the yellow tofu curry bento box and 4-piece spicy tuna roll. This came with steamed rice, salad with ginger dressing, lo mein, flash-fried green beans, and mini bites of crunchy fry dough drizzled with a sweet vanilla cream sauce (dessert name is ??). I was very impressed with my meal. The wait time from ordering to being served was less than 10 minutes. Almost everything had lots of flavor and the portions were generous. You get a great bang for your buck. IMO, I think that giving lo mein AND rice on the same platter is too much. Same with serving the veggies from the curry, the green beans, AND a salad. There was a little bit of everything to the point where it was almost an afterthought. Would have loved nixing one of the  veggies and have the option of lo mein OR rice and maybe offer the option of 2 entree portions instead of only offering one with all the other sides thrown in whether they go with the meal or not (think Panda Express). Let me not forgot to mention my boba tea with popping boba. MANGO is delish and the lechi popping boba are unreal! Looking forward to checking out more of their menu for sure"
10/2/2017,5,"I don't know what's in their food but it's so addictive. I could come eat here 3-4 days in a row and not get sick of it. I love their sushi and raw food equally as much as the fried food. I did notice that more care is taken for food that I have ordered for dine in vs food for take out. But overall I love coming here on my cheat days. It really satisfies those nasty cravings.I am the type of person, when I find somethings that I like, I will only order those things. So here are the things I get consistently from here. I start with their crab wontons. Surprisingly I like them. Sometimes they're a little too greasy but I love the cream cheese filling and the sweet and sour dipping sauce that comes with it. It's a perfect fried creamy appetizer. For my entrees, bear is mind I come here on days when I'm famished and super hangry so I order like for two. I get their bamboo rolls and one of the noodle entrees. I love the bamboo rolls because I'm not a huge fan of having cream cheese in my sushi. This roll doesn't have that. I also am all about shrimp tempura in my rolls and this has that. This roll is bomb. Is light, fresh and meaty. For the noodle entree my go tos are as follows: either the Korean or the Mongolian flavor. I have gotten the chicken and/ or shrimp. And I would switch up between the udon and the lo mein. Main take aways are: I prefer the shrimp over chicken because if I have any left over, a day old chicken I find inedible. Between the noodles, I think both are great choices. Udon has that meaty bounce that when coated with the flavor of sauce is yum. Lo mein in itself is packed with flavor and fried to perfection. Both varieties of the noodles pair well with the Korean and the Mongolian sauce. These sauces both are similar which is probably why these two are my personal favorite.  They're spicy, oniony, garlicky and packs a little heat. Last piece of advice, call in your order if you're gonna do take out. Then go straight to the cashier that is for takeout only. This place gets crazy packed during rush hour and is not great for those hangry moments."
7/18/2017,5,"Why 5 stars? Because I could eat this poke every day.   ---   ---   ---Ever since Blue A came to my wedding in Hawaii, we've been BPB (not Broward Palm Beach, but Best Poke Buds.) Prior to visiting Blue, I'd been on a solid healthy-eating streak, so I asked him to try to avoid taking me to one of those places where we eat 4,000 calories in one sitting. While later during my visit, he would fail miserably at honoring that request, for this particular meal - we ate relatively clean.I actually visited the Bento Cafe in Orlando and thought it was 'okay.' We ate sushi, and I remember thinking that it was kind of unremarkable. But that was prior to when I developed an insatiable craving for poke at all times of the day. We built our own bowl, and were allotted 3 different meats. On the menu, they tuna poke and salmon poke, so I doubled up on tuna to give account for 2/3rds of the protein, and I did not regret it. It was so damn delicious, I wanted a whole 'nother bowl when I was done. It was honestly some of the best poke I've had outside of Hawaii.As I pen this review a week later, I'm now depressed that I'm not currently sitting inside Bento Cafe eating poke!"
7/30/2017,3,"On the fence about Bento. Considering it is in this ""booming"" new area of the Tower Shops you literally have to fight off an old lady,pay someone, or do a tribal dance to get a parking spot. When we arrived the line was practically out the door; good and bad sign. Since it was my first time it allowed me to thoroughly review the menu (more than once) so I was prepared when I got to the front. When we did get to the front to order the girl at the register was not pleasant. Like, serious RBF! There was no ""hi"", ""welcome"", ""is it your first time?""... nothing. She just stood there waiting for us to say something. I realize it's a busy Saturday night but seriously a little customer service and pleasantly goes a long way dear. I ordered an appetizer of steamed dumplings, Pokè bowl and a plain black tea. Trying to find a clean table was a challenge so I asked an employee that was walking past to send someone over to clean the table, which they did right away. However, the floors in the place were gross. Liquids, wrappers, and trash everywhere! I think this had to do with the fact that they don't have lids for their cups and there's kids running around everywhere spilling drinks. I don't think I saw one employee walking around maintaining the cleanliness of the dining area the entire time we were there. Our food came surprisingly fast considering how busy it was and I was honestly shocked that everything was piping hot and the orders were correct. That was their only saving grace for me to be honest. The dumplings were pretty big and tasty and the pokè bowl ingredients were super fresh. I liked that they had a mixed greens option instead of rice which was surprisingly good. The only thing I thought was weird was the tea I ordered came in a boba tea cup and was room temp with no ice. It was a bit of a struggle to get the government sealed plastic lid off the top so I could pour it into a cup of ice. Overall, not bad but also not super great. I think in the future I'd probably order to go or come at a less busy time but considering the area that's probably never."
1/27/2019,4,"This place is too yummy! I've tried the rice bowls, bento boxes, and sushi! They are all delicious! The only thing that kinda sucks is the line gets SUPER long sometimes and if you try and order take out they take FOREVER to answer the phone... or they just don't answer. However, the tasty food definitely makes up for it!!!! P.S- if you do order take out they say it's normally 15 min till your food ready but 9 times out of 10 it'll be ready in 5!!!"
9/12/2020,5,Love me some Bento Poke Bowls! Gotta try em! Amazing!!! The service is very fast and easy. People are very friendly. And whoever installed the tiles there... did a fantastic job. ;-)
8/28/2019,5,Amazing food and great sushi. Love the Bubble Tea definitely a great spot for good food.
7/9/2021,1,"The service was unacceptable, it took 40 minutes to make three items with an empty line yet tons of messy tables. It seems like no one does much around here besides stare into the sky due to their lack of urgency. Multiple tables were complaining about the food coming out incorrect and with no sense of order. It is absolutely ridiculous that the management cannot seem to comprehend simple tasks such as delivering proper organizational skills to the staff and facility. This is the last time my family and I will be spending money at this establishment because of the horrible customer service. The experience overall was negative and I wish I could put 0 stars instead of 1."
10/13/2017,5,"This is a fast food type of Japanese/Pan Asian menu. The place is cute and conveniently located to several other walkable shops. The people are friendly. I love the ahi poke bowl, pad Thai, although a bit spicy for me and I've tried several sushi rolls all delicious."
2/24/2018,4,"We went to Bento tonight, and I can only describe it as what Pei Wei used to be about 5 years ago.  It's the same concept of standing in line to place your order at the registers and you are given a number to place on your table.  We had the Mango & Lychee Boba Teas, 3Pc Salmon Sashimi, and for entrees, I had the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup and my 8 yr old had the Teriyaki Pork Lo Mein Noodle Bowl.  Our friends had the Cali Roll, Korean Chicken Bowl and Fried Chicken Bowl.  The food and drinks were brought out very quickly and I was very impressed at how the service flowed so efficiently.I would have given the 5-Stars, but the cashier who rang up the order had such a thick accent and spoke so fast, that I couldn't understand half of what she was saying, and she never let me know that they had a Kid's Box (which I just found out about while writing this review) and that would have cut down the order time in half, and we also would not have had the mix-up with my son's Mango Boba Tea.Overall, a very nice dining experience and everyone there was very pleasant and helpful.  We will be back with the family."
1/10/2018,5,My go to is the build your own poke bowl. Half spicy tuna and half salmon is the way to go! Best of both worlds :)The $10 sushi bento box is also a good choice. Don't forget to ask for a side of spicy mayo - it's good!Line is usually to the door but don't worry it moves fairly quickly and is worth the wait.
5/21/2019,5,So yummy! First time here and babe and I had a nice quiet lunch date. I recommend it because it is nice and fresh and the restaurant is very clean and neat. Definitely going back and just FYI the plaza has alot of nice restaurants nearby; plus a shopping area!
10/10/2017,4,"Love love love in a bowl!!!!! I've been hearing about these many locations of Bento for awhile now and I finally made my ways to the Davie location. I got there about 45 mins after their open hours and they were already packed. I went on to order the Spicy Cream Chicken with white rice and I have no regrets. They give you such a good portion that I didn't even finish my food. The rice was of great texture. Not dry nor too soggy. They gave you a load of chicken, and the sauce was So on point .  I also got the Florida Roll, which had my two favorites, tuna and salmon. When you order sush, you have an option of 4 or 8 pieces. I thought that concept was pretty cool. The place was very clean.very spacious. Staff was sweet. Everyone literally had a smile on their face. I would've given them five stars but after my meal I got a Milk Tea with Almond and it was okayy. Not the best but okay.  Their boba jelly was a bit too Chewy, that made me not want to finish my drink. All in all a very SUCCESSFUL trip to Davie for yummy food."
7/21/2017,3,"As a UF Alum (Go Gators!), the Bento Cafe franchise has a special place in my heart, as I used to go when only Bento Red and Bento Blue (sounds like Pokémon games haha) existed in Gainesville. So when I found out the franchise finally made their way to South Florida, nostalgia kicked in and I could not wait to go! But because of nostalgia, I had to give this place 3 stars. Going off of the fact that I would have given the original Bentos 4 stars back in the day and rating it as a stand alone restaurant: This restaurant is busy, always. And the main reason why is that it is next to a busy area and near a university (Nova), which the owners seem to like to choose, location wise. It is a order and then sit yourself type of place. I have been to this location twice, the first time just to order bubble tea, and the second time to order a dinner entry. Both times, orders were taken very slowly and it seemed like there were more people standing behind the counter waiting to serve. The servers themselves were actually helpful and quick once you did place your order and deliver the food to your table.I ordered a Passion Fruit green boba tea, which was way too sweet to even taste the green tea, sweeter than I ever ordered before at the original Bentos. Recently, I ordered a build your own poke-bowl, which is priced based on how many types of protein you get. While the poke-bowl itself was very tasty, they did get my 2nd protein wrong, but I didn't say anything so I can't say what they would have done if I actually asked them to correct it. The sashimi in my bowl was fresh, and the portion size was just right, considering I just came from a Zumba class. They do have many other dishes (try a creative sushi special or the Spicy Cream Chicken, so good!), and their Bento box is particularly popular and a great meal value. On average, I spend about $12-15 on a meal here.The ambience is noisy and loud with pumping music. There was plenty of seating and the interior felt very clubbish. All of this is common amongst the other Bentos in Florida (I've been to the one in Jacksonville too) so at least they are consistent? In the end, my tastes may be different from my undergrad days, which is probably why I really didn't rave about this bento like I did back in the day. Still, a good option for lunch or dinner if you're craving a good Asian inspired meal if you're in the Davie Area!"
4/11/2018,5,I came to Bento for lunch and they are always pack. You can order take out and eat in. I order pad Thai and the bowl size is a good size for one person. I really like my dish I order the flavor was not too much but too little. Many Thai places lack the pad Thai sauce but Bento had it on point. I always come here when I am craving my favorite dish. Thanks for the great experience!
10/15/2017,5,"If you're in the plantation area, be sure to hit up Bento Cafe! It's like a quick service Asian fusion chipotle. The menu is jam packed with affordable deliciousness - everything from sushi and poke bowls to noodles and curry.. all served fresh in minutes!Poke bowl - can't go wrong here! Build your own bowl- one protein starting at $10, then add $1 per additional protein (up to three proteins), and tons of add in options like avocado, masago, wakame, tempura flakes.. the list goes on.Tuna poke bowl is a great choice for tuna lovers that are first timers here. Boba tea - plenty of flavor option here as well! The tea menu is next to the registers where you orderDream - coconut and taro milk tea is drrreeeammmyDefinitely plan on coming back to explore the endless menu at Bento."
11/6/2020,1,I Have order Tempura Shrimp（3） and pineapple  But take a look at home no have ，Doesn't feel good
3/1/2019,5,"What a fabulous place! The food is really good. You can make your own bowl which is what we did. You choose the protein, the add ins and the Extras and the sauce all for one low price. They also have sushi rolls, salads and more. They have an awesome Coke machine where you can create your own flavors. Super clean place and great service. The only down side was there is not any WiFi and we couldn't do any of our work while we were there."
4/18/2017,4,"Ducked in for a high powered sales meeting and it was a fine time, here's why: * Lots of nearby parking * 2 hotties joined along * Busy and popular place with the college set* Lots of options* Fairly priced* Lots of foodCabeza OUT!"
7/11/2020,4,"Good fast-casual style Asian restaurant similar to pei wei style. The spicy poyo cream sauce chicken is my favorite with a pineapple green tea boba. The kids meals are fun for the little ones, served in a bento style box with cinnamon crisp chips as a little desert. They have reduced their capacity 50% due to COVID and seemed to be enforcing guidelines."
10/24/2020,1,"Check your bags when you order pick-up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Every single time we go to pick up, there is at least one item missing and we have to go back to ask for it. After it happened the first time, it was no big deal, people make mistakes but this has happened multiple times. Today, it was a busy day and the restaurant was full so we had to wait a really long time just to get the correct order we had paid for. For the inconvenience, they couldn't even offer an apology. They said we could get a refund for the item... how about the food that I originally ordered!??!! it's not my fault they made a mistake."
5/21/2017,5,"We come here anytime we want an Asian fix. Wifey gets plenty of tasty vegan choices and there's something for everyone. Reminiscent of a Pei Wei but with better quality and choices. The curry is nice and portions are generous without going overboard. They have ramen, udon, Taiwanese noodles, brown and white rice for starches. Plus you choose the protein (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu, etc) and veggies."
9/6/2019,3,"Ok so I have been a fan of Bentos for a long time and mein I loved it!  But today was not one of there best  it seems that they are going down on quality, from the to go bentos box plate to the food quality is different!!!! The bento box plate use to be a high quality I use to even reuse it, and the lo mein was dry  and the chicken seemed to have been cooked hours ago it didn't taste fresh (was chewy texture) and the little wonton dessert had no sauce the use sugar now, not a good combo  I don't know, but this version of the bentos is one that is not too good, please bring back your quality, I would hate to see your loyal customers like myself start finding other options"
4/6/2017,4,"Conveniently placed in the Towers Shoppes plaza, Bento is a great option for lunch or dinner! I have eaten here many times and its perfect for when you just need a quick pick. The line to order usually moves very fast and although it takes sometime to get your food out to your table, its never disappointing. Bento has something for everyone. Those who want raw fish or won't eat raw food. Rice dishes, noodle dishes, poke bowls, sushi.... They have it all!The menu features a wide variety of items and I have been happy with almost everything I have tried. My favorite sushi: Lust roll. Filled with spicy tuna and topped with fried fish. Super decadent and deliciousFavorite hot items: Spicy creamy chicken with the mini udon noodles. I have also tried the spicy creamy shrimp, but I found that there is much more batter than shrimp. Also make sure to try any of the spicy creamy dished with their white sauce! This is recommended to me by one of the cashiers and it definitely gives it extra depth of flavor.In the mood for a rice dish? Try the Japanese curry pork katsu. I was extremely surprised to have liked this dish as much as I did! Very crispy fried pork with a flavorful curry on the side. SO GOOD. SO MUCH COMFORT.Poke bowls are also very satisfying and filling when you are in the mood for raw fish. You get to choose different toppings to go with your protein choice, its all customizable.Things I may not recommend: boba teas. I'm just not a fan of powdered drinks. Id rather get my boba fix else where"
5/7/2020,1,"Bento was one of our favorite places to go until the last few months. We always order tofu in our bowls, we have given this place at least 3 chances to get better and for those past three the tofu is not editable. It's hard and and very hard to chew, definitely way over cooked and the green beans aren't even cleaned (see pic)!  This makes me so sad because the sauce on the sweet n sour and sesame is so delicious but now I don't even want to come back. I'm not sure about the meat because we are vegetarian. I don't think I will return again. Completely disappointed."
8/4/2017,2,"Giving this place this rating solely on their sashimi. So thick it was almost like a steak. It may not be good for some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did my husband. Now, the line was huge. The menu a bit confusing   The food, I guess I was expecting more, but the rice was dry. The Szechuan chicken didn't taste like I remember Szechuan is supposed to taste. I asked for additional sauce to wet the rice and the guy said it was an additional 1.06 and then said never mind I'll just get it for you. Overall, I think this is the new thing, but I didn't find it was somewhere I'd venture back to. If by chance I did go back, I would try something completely different. My husband had he Korean shrimp wok, and he too was disappointed."
11/23/2020,1,"Eaten here many times so I was disgusted to find out it was shut down temporarily by the health department for, among other things:""Sewage/wastewater backing up through floor drains. Observed cooks working in standing water at cook line in the kitchen.""To think my food may have been prepared by cooks standing in sewage water is unfathomable to me. How did you guys not immediately fix this? Who in their right mind would continue to prepare and serve food in such unsanitary conditions? You're dealing with people's health here. Completely lost my trust in this place."
9/27/2020,3,The miso soup is good. The ginger salad is not your traditional ginger dressing that you're accustomed to from Asian restaurants. So that's different. I got the steak teriyaki. Absolutely disgusting. Idk what cut of meat it is but it was gross. I couldn't eat it. Did you also know that this place doesn't have knives so I couldn't cut my food? Very odd experience here tonight.
7/15/2019,4,"Great spot for lunch. Perhaps you've noticed the rise of restaurants that seem to want to be above fast food but aren't quite a sit-down restaurant. Examples off of the top of my head would be Pieology (pizza), PDQ (chicken), BurgerFi (burgers), Dickey's Barbecue (bbq), etc. This is one of those places.You essentially choose whether you want rice, noodles, or the bento box. Then you get to choose your protein (meat) and flavor/sauce.I got the szechaun bento box with chicken. Everything was very good and I'd be happy to come back for lunch in the future."
12/23/2020,5,"London may be 10 hours away but he rocks Bento Asian kitchen, great management young man!!  all of almost maybe 24 years old ... He took my needs and wants a head of everything else that night and,  gave me everything I wanted. I see you hustling London keep it going good work!  I will be back"
5/8/2021,1,"Horrible food waste of $$$ rice was horrible ,the orange chicken was disgusting . The bento place was horrible everything we ate was gross, never going back to this place ."
9/30/2018,4,Great spot for lunch or dinner. Line is usually pretty long but it goes quick. I have always ordered their spicy tuna poke bowl. It is filling and fresh. The blend of flavor it perfect. You can make your own also. Service is always great and food comes out quick and fresh.
3/31/2019,4,"Great for lunch, it is an upscale Chipotle but  w/ good Asian food. you pay as you order, you take a seat when you take a number they will bring your food to you. The food is fresh, service is friendly but ill dock 1 star for NO WIFI."
4/15/2021,2,The bento box was decent.  I like the chicken.  Everything else in the box was just ok.  The lo mein noodles were linguine noodles which was odd.  The sushi is seriously some of the worst sushi I have ever eaten. It did not taste fresh.  I also had to wait over 20 min for my to-go order and they weren't even busy.
6/21/2019,4,"Ended up coming here because the other poke place in this plaza was closed. No regrets. The food was amazing. I ordered the Mongolian bowl with fried rice & my husband ordered the Pao Pao bowl with fried rice. We also tried the dragon roll which was delicious as well.  The food was hot, fresh, & came quickly. Good portion sizes. Great service as well. Only issue I had here was the import drinks were pricey ($14) & they only had 2 of the boba & green tea flavors available. All in all Definitely would comeback again."
6/5/2020,4,"Bento Davie is a wonderful establishment that offers some of the best Asian cousins in town. One of my personal favorites is the Poke bowl where you can customize the contents of your bowl to tailor to your liking. Bento also has an amazing atmosphere, perfect to sit down with clients."
5/31/2019,5,"Great place, they consistently put out good food. They have a lot of options wether you want sushi, poke bowl, soups or a bento box this is why my family likes it so much. My favorite is the poke bowl, I usually get a small (it's big enough) and a ramen soup (also very big). They have available white, whole wheat or cauliflower rice to go with your dish. There is a discount if you follow them on Instagram."
12/7/2016,4,"I honestly think they're a 3.5. Each time I've come here (usually with a group of people), a dish is typically forgotten... :( And so someone from our table ends up having to follow up at least once or twice with the cashiers to see where our missing items are.Other than that, the food is good. :) I typically love getting the build your own poké bowl! I'm a total salmon fan, so I usually go wittthhh...BROWN RICE (but they always forget ;_;)PROTEINS (up to 3!)+ Salmon+ Spicy Marinated Salmon, and because I'm not a complete salmon savage...+ TunaADDITIONS (up to 4!)+ Avocado+ Tempura Flakes+ Nori+ Masago(I'm kind of craving poké now, you guys...)SAUCESFan of the white sauce ;) haha, or spicy mayo!Something equally delicious as the build your own poké bowl is the Spicy Cream Shrimp dish (from the Wok section). It's sweet/spicy and delicious. Insert aghhh emoji face here. Just had dinner, but now I'm getting hungry again haha.So, yes. Definitely give this place a try! :) The only downside is that they can forget some items (maybe cos each time I came, I came with a group of like 5/6 people? Things get lost easily?). But other than that, customer service is always lovely and the food is yum!"
5/24/2021,5,"Excellent service, Lyne was so helpful in helping me with my order. The food was so fresh and delicious. Beautiful location where you can park on either side of the Restaurant."
10/19/2020,3,"We have been ordering Bento ToGo for months now due to COVID and we have always been satisfied. The food is always delicious. So while out today, we decided to dine in. I ordered the regular poke bowl with spicy tofu, avocado, cucumber, asparagus, tempura flakes, fried onions, and wonton strips. My wife ordered the katsu bowl with udon noodles and green beans. The food was delicious but my poke bowl was missing the avocado, fried onions, and tempura flakes and my wife's was missing the green beans. I only noticed the avocado at first and spoke to the cashier. I literally received 1 slice of avocado cut in half. When realizing that my dish was still missing items and so was my wife's we decided to just finish eating and leave. We will probably not dine in again."
4/24/2019,5,"I used to enjoy eating at Bento when I was attending the University of Florida. I was sooooooooooo excited when I learned that a location was opening up in south Florida. This was my second time at this location and I was not disappointed. I ordered Pad Thai over the phone as a to go order. My order was ready when I arrived. It was full of flavor. I am patiently waiting for the Pembroke Pines location to open. Until then, I will definitely return to this location."
2/19/2017,4,This place is always busy every time I come here. What's good though is the service is pretty quick. If you want a quick bite of some asian fusion food I'd suggest coming here. Staff is nice and it's pretty clean inside. One thing I was pretty sad about though was that the night I went Bento was out of regular boba.. That's actually the reason I decided to go there was for the boba tea. Hopefully the next time I go back they'll have some.
6/2/2019,5,"This place is awesome! The ambiance is nice, food is great, and staff is nice. The Schezuan Beef Noodle Soup is great. The level of spiciness can't be changed though. The Pineapple fried rice is good too. Their Thai tea is amazing! It's flavorful. They need to put another soda machine though. I highly recommend it."
8/14/2017,4,"Fun way to eat your Asian cravings, place is always packed and for a reason: food is amazing and the menu is very extensive. Poke bowls, bento boxes, sushi, soups, noodles, etc are offered. I always get the poke bowls and they never have disappointed me, the ingredients are always fresh and very tasty, always on target and well presented. Lines are long as you have to order to a cashier and they'll bring your stuff to your table. Atmosphere is busy, noisy and fun. Just go!!!"
11/11/2016,4,"Bento had been a favorite for many UF Gators and Gainesville folks cause it was one of the few Asian fusion restaurants in the city. When we didn't have much to choose from, this was top notch. Finally, Bento expanded to South Florida. Now that I'm not in my college years anymore, I thought that Bento was decent but not the most amazing Chinese or sushi restaurant I can find. It's fast, convenient and the staff is friendly. However, come on a week night and definitely be prepared to wait in line.... A long one. You order at the counter, pay and get a number, then sit and wait for the server to bring your food out. They have noodle bowls, rice bowls, bento boxes, a huge list of sushi rolls and lots of Boba tea mixes. It's a mix of Chinese, Korean and Japanese cuisine. Me and my friend got a Crunchy roll to split. It was a big portion and delicious as I remembered it. Crispy outside and soft inside. The filling was cooked just right. I also got a poke bowl with 3 proteins-tuna, salmon, eel. There was alot of rice but not alot of fish. Only two tiny pieces of eel. They were gracious on the avocado but I still felt a bit sad on the balance of fish to rice. At the Gainesville location, the tuna and salmon dons ate packed to the brim. For the cost, I would've expected more."
7/28/2017,4,"I finally stopped by even thou seemed a little busy for the 12-2 pm lunch rush hour. It was a bit overwhelming ( the menu ) with so many options. I finally settled in a lechee canned drink ( to the left of the cashiers)  on a open refrigerator. Was soooooo good a must have !!!! Then I ordered a ginger salad, 2 veggie spring rolls and a volcano roll. All of it was $19.61. Towards the back of the restaurant is where you get your chop sticks napkins silver ware. My ginger salad came out quick and was good. Lettuce pieces were not cut into bite size so just a little awkward eating some of it - really not a big deal. Then the spring rolls came out, yummy ! And then the sushi roll. Not my favorite I'm just use to a different roll from every other place I've ordered. The fish was ok, it again not my favorite. I will give it another try since there is so much food I want to try out. Very quick service. Oh please tip !!!!the staff does a great job getting your food out to you and cleaning up."
12/9/2016,3,"So all my friends have been raving about this place and I had to see what the big deal was. Their menu is pretty extensive and it took me a bit to figure out what I wanted. I decided to get some poke and milk tea. I asked the cashier for some suggestions which I quickly realized was a mistake. None of them seemed to be that familiar with the menu/ingredients either. Salmon poke bowl - Made my own bowl with asparagus, avocado, mango, mushrooms, plus ginger and chili sauce which came on the side. It was a good mix, but there was SOO much rice! By the end there was still enough rice for 1-2 more bowls. What a waste.Pineapple milk tea - Not sure if it was the milk tea itself or the combo with pineapple, but it just tasted...odd...and had a weird aftertaste. Do not recommend.Overall, I can see why this place is popular since you can customize your order, but it's not without issues."
5/16/2021,1,"55 minutes for an order for two to be given. Very very long wait. Would not recommend people to come here when hungry. If so come two hours before you are ready to eat. They also did not go in order, people after us were receiving  food while we were still waiting. I even heard two families complaining about the same issue."
10/14/2016,4,"Bento is a great addition to the Davie restaurant scene!  Bento is fast casual Asian and delivers with very good food and quick service. Don't let the long lines stop you. You may wait on line to order, but the food comes out very quickly . I am wondering if the lines will get shorter once the novelty wears off. Bento Cafe has a large two sided menu. The blue side has sushi and poke bowls. The red side has hot food. We have been to Bento Cafe several times and we have tried several items. From the blue side:  Poke Bowl ($8-11) depending on number of proteins)-excellent!  Choose your base (brown or white rice, or salad), choose 1-3 proteins. I have had poke tuna, poke salmon, spicy tuna, smoked salmon...all fresh & delicious!  However there are also other proteins available including plain tuna & salmon, Krab, Tempura Chicken & Shrimp Tempura, Fried Tofu, Eel, & Wahoo. The portions are not huge.  I can  easily finish three proteins. Then choose up to four ""additions"". I have had edamame, tempura flakes, wakame, masago, and avocado. There are many others to choose from including veggies, nuts, etc.  Then choose two sauces out of the nine choices. I love the sweet chili sauce. The spicy mayo is good as well. Overall, the poke bowls are fresh, flavorful, and reasonable. Spicy Tuna Roll-very good!Blue Kawaii Roll-This roll was wrapped in rice paper and lettuce, without rice. It had yellowtail, krab delite, salmon (which I substituted for tuna), avocado, and ponzu sauce... very light, tasty, and refreshing roll!The red side of the menu is where you can order rice or noodle bowls and bento boxes.  The price of each depends on the protein and there are about 17 ways your protein can be prepared. Bento covers several Asian prep styles including Korean, Thai, and Chinese.  You can upgrade all of these to a combo which includes a side (edamame, ginger salad, or miso soup) and a beverage. The miso soup is better than average simply because it is not salty as so many miso soups are. The ginger salad also comes with the bento box. I have had better. The bento box also comes with lo mein (very weak), string beans (very good), and rice. I don't think I would get  the bento box again simply because the salad and lo mein were not very good. For my main dish in the bento box I ordered Tofu Sriracha Garlic. The Tofu was overly fried. The Sriracha sauce was too thick, gooey, and overwhelming. I would not recommend.  I did try 11 year old's Spicy Hunan Steak. This was not fried and had a really nice soy chili garlic sauce with just the right amount of heat.  We also tried the pork dumplings which were a little bland.  Bento also has milk and blended teas. You can choose from all sorts of flavors and add boba, popping boba, or jelly. I tried a pineapple blended tea with boba. It was cool, frosty, tasty, and refreshing!I guess so far I am more impressed with the blue side of the menu, although I look forward to trying more hot dishes from the red side. The Beef Noodle Soup is on my list when I am in the mood for a heartier meal. Bento recently added a second cashier so the lines go faster. The staff is always very pleasant. The servers bring the food to your table. They will bring silverware and water as well and clean the table. Overall, nice option for fast casual Asian food in Davie! Bento has already become a staple in our dining out repertoire"
3/18/2017,3,"Krab ragoons were ok the dipping sauce had nasty after taste AND do not order the monoglian beef...disgusting  noodles were cold..not enough sauce. Had to ask them to put in the microwave. Sushi was on point we ordered the Miami roll, it should have been a sushi only spot. I was so disappointed.  $$ 35.00 foolishly spent on trying a new food spot!I won't be back unless someone begs me."
6/29/2019,5,"I love Bento so much that I wish they have a vip card! My first visit to bento was with a group of girlfriends in Jacksonville. This was before they open up other locations. I always wish they had something like this in Miami. Little did I know, they opened up one in Davie by the town shops. Ever since I found this location, I have been coming here multiple times a month. There is always a long line all the way by the door. This place is always busy but so worth waiting for. Their udon garlic broccoli and shrimp is delicious! So is their beef tawainese soup! But beware, this soup is spicy! The spicy cream chicken is also very tasty. Definitely another dish I recommend trying or their bento box with a variety of salad, protein and carb of your choice. This restaurant is by far one of my favorite Asian fusion restaurants. Now that I found out they are opening a new bento behind my job at Dania Beach pointe plaza. I need a bento credit card!"
7/6/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is the place to go if you want good, affordable, and fast Asian food. It's a quick service restaurant, so you order your food at the counter, pick up your number, and everything gets brought out to your table as it's made. Similar in concept to Pei Wei, but that's as far as the similarities go. Bento is a more upscale spot that is higher in quality and has a menu with a huge variety of options. I'm not really big on raw fish, but I've been here so many times that I've actually tried the entire kitchen menu - this is what happens when I go with friends and family consistently for six months, ha! The kitchen menu has a basic outline: you order your choice of entree and have it served in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. The bento box basically let's you have a variety of food. Everything is separated in different compartments, and it looks super presentable especially if you want to post a picture of what you got. Also, if you don't like one of the items that comes in the box, you can do up to two substitutions at no extra charge with something that already comes in the box. So if you don't like the string beans you can substitute it for more noodles. You get the concept. I typically go for the rice bowls because let's be real, I'm a student and cheap. Out of all the items I've tried, my top five would be the red curry, curry katsu, garlic soy, pineapple thai fried rice, and Korean. I usually get chicken as my protein; honestly I don't like the steak here it's cut up into pieces and automatically well done. I prefer the chicken or tofu. My mom loves the Taiwanese rice noodles here; she says they remind her of this Filipino dish called pancit so she always orders it when she comes. As far as side items go (I say side because they're not guaranteed to come out before your entree) my absolute ride or die is the fried krab wontons. They are to die for especially with the sweet chili sauce they come with. You also get one free sauce per entree and then the ones after that are $0.50 each. I don't eat sushi, but my dad loves the sushi and poke bowls here. Poke bowls are basically sashimi bowls over rice! You have the option to build your own poke bowl or choose from the pre-built options. When you build your own, you choose a base of white rice, brown rice or mixed greens. Then you choose up to three proteins. The pricing is based on the amount of proteins you pick. VERY IMPORTANT TIP: You can't order two of the same protein. You can order three of the same, but not two. The extra dollar that you pay for the second protein is for the variety, but the total amount of protein you get is the same as for the one protein. Yes, I know it's confusing but one of the cashiers nicely explained it to me. You automatically get four additions, one topping, and two sauces on the side. When my dad doesn't build his own, he likes to get the tuna poke bowl or the spicy tuna/salmon don. He's very health conscious so when he orders sushi he likes to get the kawaii rolls, which are wrapped in rice paper and lettuce instead of rice and seaweed. They also offer a HUGE variety of boba teas! They offer milk tea, milk tea smoothies, green teas, blended ices, and Thai tea. You can also combine up to two flavors and they have a list of combo suggestions on the wall as well. I prefer to order the passionfruit green tea or the strawberry mango blended ice. You can get a regular size for $3.50 or a large for $5.00. Pro tip: the boba doesn't automatically come in the tea! It's an add on item. $0.50 for regular tapioca pearls and flavored jellies and $0.75 for popping boba. If you ask the cashiers will let you try the boba and jellies, but you can't try the flavored teas because they are made to order. They also have a boba rewards punch card where if you buy 8 teas, you get one free. The free one is a regular size though so don't expect a large for your free one. The workers bring out the tea to your number as well, so you can sit anywhere you like and they bring it to you. Very convenient!The service is extremely fast here. Food comes out as it's made, so don't expect all your food to come out at once! After eating here so much I tell people that Bento spoils me because every time I go to other places the food comes out too slow and I get super hangry. One time my food came out before I even sat down - it was magical. You get your utensils, napkins, water, and to-go boxes yourself by the soda station and sit wherever you want. The restaurant is usually pretty chilly so bring a jacket or sit in the warmer areas by the back. The workers are pretty chill and are good about keeping everything restocked and clean. Overall, great food, great concept, great design. 10/10 recommend."
12/6/2018,5,"I really like this place.  The service is always great.  The cashiers are always patient and always have answers to my questions.  I've only gotten poke bowls but the other entrees and rolls etc I've seen other people are eating look really good.  This place is always packed.  Line is usually out the door.  Please do not be discouraged!  The workers move very fast!  You won't be waiting long so stick it out!  Be sure to ask for a cup for water, it's complimentary at the soda machine.  But only get water because if you put soda or juice in the water cup you'll be charged!  Lol. Well that's what the sign says."
3/27/2017,4,"Looks like Bento Cafe situates themselves close to college campuses. Smart idea. This is affordable Japanese fast food. I was impressed with the good value. This location was clean, well laid out, brightly lit. It is in a fairly new mall that is very pleasant. Wear a sweater, it was chilly when we went last night (March 26, 2017). Extensive menu - but takes some time to figure it out. More photos might be helpful.The ordering system is somewhat similar to Chipotle, you stand in line to order, except they give you a number stand for your table and deliver your food. Time for delivery was very good and you definitely benefit from them making it up fresh.  I ordered two things I was pleased with. A wok stir fry with tofu in a bento box. The string beans that came separately in the bento box were perfectly cooked. (Note that string beans are one of the few vegetables that supermarkets source locally in Southern Florida) I have posted a photo of it here. Very good value for $11. No extra charge for choosing brown rice. I enjoyed the Hawaii sushi I chose. No rice. Very tasty. (posted photo)My cousin, John, ordered the Hunan bowl with shrimp. He was disappointed. He likes spicy food but he said that spicy was ultimately the only flavor in this dish and it got boring. (posted photo).Ample parking in this mall. Yelp - your choices don't include mall parking. I answered that there is outdoor seating but it is limited."
10/26/2016,3,"My boyfriend and I came to this hot spot because of all the great reviews and because I was dying to try the poke bowl everyone's been raving about. We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. The lines moved quickly and we could still find a cletable to sit at, which was great. My boyfriend ordered the fried tofu with Mongolian sauce over rice. The flavor was excellent but the portion was tiny. There was double the amount of rice that was necessary for the amount of protein he got. I created my own poke bowl and it was fresh and good except for the huge amount of rice as well. We also got a side of fried dumplings that were really overfried. We regretted not getting the steamed ones. Overall not a lot of food for the $30 we spent on lunch. We would've probably preferred to go to a less casual/fast food/trendy place and paid the same amount of money for a little more food. We will come back to try other items maybe, but only if we're already in the area."
10/30/2019,4,"The thing I like most about this place is there are so many different choices and things you can get from the menu so you don't get bored eating same old thing while you're there. I love their bento box which gives you a main item of your choosing, green beans, rice, salad with delicious ginger dressing and lo mein noodles. Their Pao Pao spicy shrimp is so good my mouth is watering just thinking of it. They have some delicious rolls but my favorite roll is their Mex roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado and eel sauce. The different textures and flavors combine for such an amazing taste. They give you generous portions, especially with the rice and noodle bowls. My only complaint is that there was a $5 upcharge to get fried rice instead of white rice which I thought was a little high. Other than that the food is fairly priced.  It gets very busy here during lunch time but the line moves pretty quickly."
11/29/2016,5,"You think your days of college are over. But one thing that just keeps on bringing back the nostalgia of good times. Bento Cafe has slowly been making it's way down to South Florida.  And by goodness, it still brings the food at a reasonable price.  The nostalgia of being at a social club event and going to Bento afterwards has really made the community reminisce of the good times.  The red curry katsu, szechuan noodle soup, and the cream sauce are still as good as ever.  Being by the upcoming Davie Tower Center has really made it's presence felt.This is a place that has staying power.  Enjoy the good fast Asian food. Davie, you're in for a treat!"
8/29/2020,1,Poorly managed. If you order pick up or from uber eats expect your order to be messed up (on multiple occasions in my instance) and management to offer not as much as an apology. I have been a loyal customer since my days at the original Bento in Gainesville but that ended today. Do better Bento.
4/25/2021,1,"Due to the lack of staff and/or ingredients they are not selling rolls, although you can see many of them in the menu... A Japanese restaurant not selling sushi, sashimi and rolls!! Just to complete the experience... they missed my daughter's order."
12/12/2016,3,"It pains me to have to redo my initial review of 5-stars from last week :-(I was so excited to take my beau here for him to experience everything I've been raving about. We grabbed menus and proceeded to order. He got the pork bento box combo. I ordered the poke' bowl as usual. We sat down at the worst table in the place. My honey cannot pick seats anymore. LOL The seat is near the beverage and utensils station. A column pretty much blocks the side of two tables. I would suggest you only sit there if a party of two sitting on opposite sides. We sat near each other and when I wanted to refill my beverage, I found myself sliding down to the other side so as not to disturb his eating (pics available). This is still not the reason for the 3-stars. Why the 3-stars? Well since I had a direct view of the water filling station, I noticed an employee refill her water bottle. She placed the spigot directly into her water bottle. Working in healthcare has me pretty sensitive to these opportunities of contamination. Although the pull lever idea of dispensing water is convenient and trendy, I implore  the owners and management to revisit this method. Until then, guess who won't be having water at this establishment?I wanted to speak with the MOD but my beau was rushing me out the door because we needed to get back home for our puppy. I'll have to ring them instead."
4/24/2021,4,"Food is tasty, nice portions per palate. They offered online ordering service but was not avail unable when I was there. They took too long for the beverages to come."
4/19/2021,4,Hit or miss here. Food is always good but boba smoothies usually limited by flavors and honey boba almost always out by mid afternoon.
2/14/2019,4,Tuna bowl was delish and the staff was so friendly! I can't wait to go back and try more things from their menu !!
10/2/2016,3,"I've stopped into this brand new location 4 times so far- the first time was around dinner time, and the line was really long and I was in a rush so I left and tried to call to order take out while running other errands, but they didn't pick up the phone. At that point they'd only been open a few days so I returned again another day and got some take out and lucked out that there were only a couple people in line so I was in and out in no time. I got the spicy cream tofu rice bowl and it was great. I came back again to order take out for my boyfriend and he enjoyed his dish. I've also tried the boba tea, and it was good but not great. I came again to finally try eating in with a few friends, and while I like the concept, they aren't really equipped yet to handle long lines (they only use 1-2 of their tills even though there are three, and while it seems like one is supposed to be for take out, everyone stands in one line. I lucked out in that most of the line was behind me. However, when I received my dish, it was lukewarm at best, so I think the majority of the items are pre-made and just thrown together and heated for a minute, which while not the worst thing in the work, is really just A-OK. I wouldn't rank this as my favorite, but I can see the appeal, especially with college students. I've been to locations else where and had similar mixed feelings. I wouldn't wait in a super long line for it, but if they weren't busy and I was looking for something fast, I'll probably return."
9/25/2016,5,"I was excited to try this place out so went with my boyfriend for lunch. On a Sunday afternoon the line was long but moved at a decent pace, and gave us time to look over the menu and see what we wanted.  We went with the spicy cream chicken bento box combo with miso soup and the bamboo roll. We took our seats and the food was brought out shortly. Everything was delicious. The sushi was sooo fresh. The spicy cream chicken was so delicious. The bento box came with green beans, lo mein, brown rice, salad and dessert. The salad was lacking but everything else was great. I am so glad to have this place nearby as I can easily see myself ordering soups to go (to take to work for lunch the next day) or just coming in for sushi. It was so fresh. I cant wait to try other things on the menu but it will be difficult deciding whether to order the same thing because it was so amazing or try something else."
8/8/2018,5,"I am so in love with this place! I finally checked this place out one day during lunch when I needed a break from school. I went over and tried their bento bowls. I must say, it's absolutely the best! Not only do you get to pick and choose what you want added to your customized bowl, but everything is fresh and delicious! Definitely worth your money. They give you such a big portion, that you have leftovers for dinner or when you get hungry again when studying. I've come back a couple more times, and can't wait to try out their rolls next time I bring my boyfriend. The place is also very clean, and the service is great. They were patient with me the first time I came here, and answered any questions I had in regards to the menu and the things I could do."
4/13/2021,1,"I will never go to this location again, severely disappointed. I ordered an order for here and waited 25 min, for a poké bowl. When I asked how much longer I was told it was almost done when it wasn't even started. Then when I asked to change it to TO-Go the woman in the window began yelling and complaining. Several others were upset asking for their food as well. Location was clearly overwhelmed with online ordering, perhaps turn it off for an hour to catch up and serve the people dining in."
6/4/2019,4,Today I went here for dinner with my sister and her friends. The lo mein noodles were good. The chicken katsu was very good. It was flakey and the quality of the chicken meat was good. Everyone thought that the chicken katsu tasted like chicken nuggets.
7/23/2018,4,"I've been here, at the Tower Shoppes, a couple of times; right after Hurricane Irma, and then more recently with my little girl. They offer a variety of choices with boxes, bowls and rolls, and they have boba teas. On this visit, we ordered a box and a bowl. My daughter's lo mein noodle bowl with orange chicken was delicious. She also ordered the boba tea, which she hated, and I don't blame her. I guess it's not our thing! I had the box with brown rice, string beans, lo mein and ginger salad. Everything was hot & fresh. The place was neat, including the Ladies Room, and the customer service was good. The ambiance is quiet, but that was perfect, as we wanted to just sit next to each other and catch up on the week's activities. Would I recommend it, Yes!"
5/29/2020,1,"Staplers must be hard to find since that could be your ""alternative"" method to securing and tamper proofing a bag. Maybe you should call your local McDonald's or Latin American grill to find out where they get there stapler from."
12/15/2016,5,"I went to Bento Cafe with five other people and absolutely loved it! This restaurant itself has a solid amount of seating and you order at the counter and then sit anywhere you like. There are many options from rice and noodle bowls to sushi and even poke bowls. Most people in my group got either a rice or noodle bowl, which was very delicious. I got the shrimp bowl with udon noodles and the spicy cream sauce, which I highly recommend. I do think they could have added more sauce as it was not enough for the amount of udon noodles they gave. We also got the sushi box combo with the Mt Fuji roll to share which was good but nothing special. One person in my group got the bento box which was surprisingly very large and difficult to finish. I also got a bubble tea which was average. Overall: Really great food and very filling for a solid price."
8/21/2018,5,"We travel to south Florida quite often, and we always visit Bento Cafe for lunch. And always had a great experience!The first time we stumbled here while looking for a bubble tea place. And Bento Cafe serves a pretty darn good bubble tea! Tapioca is always fresh and soft, they have a variety of flavors. Ordered many different ones and always enjoyed it. It's a fast food type place for Asian fusion fans, but no matter how long the line is to order, your food arrives fast and fresh. We never had issues with bad flavor or ill looking dishes. We have tried their sushi, bento boxes, noodles dishes - everything is flavorful and just like you ordered. Their staff is courteous and always helpful. Overall, it's a great Asian fusion place, we have returned time after time, and were never disappointed."
1/21/2018,5,"Great for Poke bowls! You can make your own poke rice bowl, choosing from a lot of different toppings. It makes it really fun to customize what you want. Recommend the spicy tuna, it is really good with some avocado and masago.The boba is too sweet though, and you can not customize the sugar."
2/24/2019,5,"Love the food here, and the price is so reasonable! And the sushi is fresh. Great for lunch but they are usually pretty busy so you'll need some patients."
2/24/2020,3,Ok. My friends chicken Katsu was way overdone and patchy burnt. His wife's and My bowl was good though. I guess you need to make sure to tell them to katsu with caution
8/28/2018,4,Love this place!! They have many options and everything is extremely tasteful. You'll always always leave full. I just wish they had more Gluten Free options.
8/28/2018,4,"One of the newer places in the Tower Shops, it is trendy and has decent food. They have a good menu with sushi, poke bowls, noodle and rice bowls, and bento boxes. I had shrimp pad Thai and the kid had some broccoli and steak bowl. Both were really tasty. The Pad Thai had a nice amount of spice to it. I saw they had boba teas and a pick up area for take out. The line to order got long but was quickly handled and our food came out relatively fast.  It's a nice atmosphere inside. I'd come back and try another dish."
3/15/2019,4,"Last minute dinner date with kids. My son said ""let's try a new Asian place "". Well great choice,!! Affordable , quick service, attentive helpful staff and yes good was on point.  Will definitely recommend and come again."
4/21/2019,5,"Best Pan Asian cuisine! Their food is always served fresh and their price is unbeatable! Love all of their food, especially the Korean chicken Udon noodle bowl!"
7/8/2018,5,"This place is fast food meets bento with speed and quality. Really enjoy going here. Food tastes great and it is served quick. I've had their sushi, bento and soups. Everything is a winner."
3/3/2020,4,"We went on a Sunday afternoon and not crowded, which probably helped with waiting only a short period of time to get our food. All three of our Thai dishes were delicious. The only downside to my Pad Thai dish was that it had a minimal amount of vegetables and meat. Unfortunately, the air conditioning was too cold and all three of us got a bit chilled."
10/31/2019,5,This please has great fresh food and great staff! Food gets brought to the table FAST and is always fresh. I love the Poke bowls and sushi! The Thai fried rice is great also! The only knock I can give this place is that the Bubble tea is too sweet for me and they can't make it less sweet. But overall I'm very happy with this place!
5/28/2020,5,I love this place- good food and inexpensive. My kids love the chicken fried rice and I love their bamboo roll! Highly recommended
12/3/2019,4,"Stopped in for lunch here since I was in the mood to try something new. I tried both the Wok chicken friend rice and a Lo Mein noodle bowl. I enjoyed both especially the Lo Mein noddle bowl, but nothing really distinguishes it from other choices in the area. The staff was all polite, the location was clean, and the service was extremely quick. They have plenty of parking since it's in a shopping center with other restaurant nearby. I will be back to try their other selections and update my review if any are notable mentions."
11/25/2016,3,"Waited until my 2nd visit to review. This visit was a big improvement. My tips: order online in advance,  avoid the ginger salad and go for a poke bowl.  Had a poke bowl with brown rice, salmon & spicy tuna. it was very good and fresh. Service was also better. Still had to wait,  but there were 2 cashiers this time and got food pretty quickly. Last time I came with my husband,  we waited about 25 min before ordering, then waited quite a bit for our food.  Also got our food at different times... as in, I was almost done when my husband's food got to the table.  I think the servers just bring out whatever is ready as soon as it comes out, so the timing could be better  The bento boxes were ok, although the ginger salad was a shredded mess."
10/3/2016,5,"First time trying this place, went with a friend it was recommended by her roommate. Enormous menu! Asian on one side, sushi on the other. Everything was so fresh, only thing is all the food does not come at the same time. It took kind of long, it was 1230 lunch rush definitely and they're short staffed. We ordered the garlic edamame regular size (it's a rather small portion), the Kuwaii roll (most popular one) and we made Poke Bowls which allow you to pick 3 proteins 4 add-ins and 2 sauces with rice or lettuce. EVERYTHING WAS SO FRESH AND DELICIOUS. I definitely want to come back asap to try their Asian menu."
5/21/2018,5,"Bento cafe is one of my favorite local options for quick take home dinners. I'm sure you can call ahead but I always just show up and place my orders to go and even on this last visit when I walked in with the line ending basically at the door, after placing my order I still waited less than 10 minutes. I've tried their rice bowls, sushi and poke bowls and have found them all to be pretty good. This most recent visit I ordered a honeydew boba tea, spring rolls, ginger scallion bowl with shrimp for my mom and a build your own poke bowl on mixed greens with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, krab and a million toppings. All of it came out in a timely manner prepared nicely and with good flavoring. I will continue to come here when I'm in the mood for something flavorful and quick."
7/27/2018,5,The poke bowl was really yummy and the sushi was good also. My daughter had the kids chicken teriyaki with noodles and she liked it. Will definitely go back.
1/24/2019,5,So I saw this place randomly when googling for a place to eat. It's nice and clean. Got my food to go. Was good and a lot of food! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
4/6/2018,5,"Kind of a chipotle or Pei Wei style service. The food is great and pretty quick. The long lines tell you how good it is. Love that I can get a poke bowl quickly. They have tons of other Asian food options like miso soups, sushi, poke bowls, Asian teas and sodas, etc. Would definitely recommend"
11/27/2018,4,"We love it here:  variety, quick, & a good value.   The only issue we had tonight was with the sauces.  Why limit 1 sauce per entree?   I ordered 2 then went to go sit down while my husband placed his order.   The cashier said that he couldn't have a sauce because I had already taken his share (she never told me I was taking his).   Then she told him about the new policy, and wanted to charge him for his sauce.   She didn't seem to understand that when you are enforcing policies, you need to be clear and up front in the beginning...why was my husband getting the runaround, but I was handed 2 sauces with no explanation.  So strange since we are there weekly and have never had issues.   Weird!"
2/11/2021,1,Waiting for an order that THEY LOST now have to wait an extra 20mins for THEIR incompetence. Worst customer service very degrading to women. I watched as any attractive woman that came in as they walked out the boys would whisper and jeer. Don't come here all creepy.
8/20/2018,2,"Stay away from the Pad Thai if you love authentic Pad Thai from Thai restaurants owned by Thai people. The Pad Thai from this place has a very strong sour and peanuty flavor which I did not expect at all. The flavor also had a medium heat and the chicken breast meat was very tender.The yuzu slush was tart but had an authentic yuzu flavor. However, I expected it to be sweeter like the yuzu juice that used to be served on Japan Airlines.Since this was my very first meal here, I can't say that I hate or love this place yet. I'll give this place a few more chances with other dishes before I decide."
3/30/2019,5,Parking sucks during lunch hour!!! You don't have to wait in a super long line if you already place your order over the phone. They provide a lot of meat and it was very fulling
2/2/2019,5,"Yesterday was my first time dining at Bento :)Great spot for lunch or dinner!Absolutely Amazing Food with so many options!Overall good dining space, also if dining in they give you a ticket number and bring your order out fresh to your table. Pretty fast too! I hope there will be more locations other than Davie, FL ! I recommend opening one in Aventura :)"
5/18/2018,4,"I remember the first time I went to bento cafe in Gainesville for DTJ. My first order was a chicken teriyaki which is still what I order today. It's a fast casual dining place that has sushi and kitchen style food. It's a little pricey but not too much. This location on University drive  looks different than the ones in Orlando and Gainesville but it's not a bad thing. The food tastes the same as the other locations. How it works if you've never been is you go up to the cashier and order what you want and a food runner will bring it to you at your table with a number that is given when you order. I ordered a chicken teriyaki again today along with a new bowl I haven't tried, the beef bulgogi with rice bowl. Chicken teriyaki  was good it's my go to for this place. The Korean  beef bulgogi is a spicy dish but I thought it was more mild spicy than actually spicy. Much like the chicken teriyaki, it also comes with string beans. My girlfriend ordered  a bento box of chicken Katsu and she was surprised at the amount of food given. Overall we were overly satisfied with this location and the food offered. 100%+++++recommend!!!!Great place for small groups of friends or family"
9/25/2016,5,I am so glad this place is right across the street from my home! This place is amazingly delicious! With really healthy choices.The bento boxes are so worth the money! I am dying to try the pork but since they are new there shipment are a little off. Pros delicious healthy food.. really friendly staff!And you can call in your orders ahead !Cons NONE
4/25/2018,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place.  Food is good, my go-to order is either a bowl with rice and teriyaki chicken or udon noodles and chicken katsu.  I love their udon.  I personally skip the barbecue sauce they give you with the chicken, I put teriyaki sauce on the noodles, and dip the chicken in spicy mayo.  Their spicy mayo is awesome.  Most of the times, the service is fairly quick and I'm content when I leave.  However, I'm occasionally faced with poor customer service.I recently ordered in advance for pickup.  When I walked in, I passed the normal line and went straight to the pickup register, where a girl ignored me.  I asked her if I was in the right place, and she said no, I had to wait in the line that went out the door.  A little hesitant on my short lunch break, I waited thirty minutes in that line because she told me to.  When it was my turn, a different girl told me to walk up to the pickup window because I didn't have to wait in line. What!!! I asked the girl who originally made me wait why she told me I couldn't just pick up my food.  She looked at me for a second, then turned her back and walked away.  I had seen her a couple other times after this visit and she wasn't very pleasant.  A manager was helpful in assisting me with this incident, so I have returned since then.  Bento - good food, mostly pleasant, fair price"
6/11/2019,5,"Bento will forever be in my college memories. This place is honestly great. I always get the sushi and I have never had a complaint honestly it's great food. I'm actually craving it as we speak lol. The Caliente Roll is my favorite one! The Special Mexican Roll is also delicious and I will forever recommend them. The bento boxes are also delicious and the salad that comes with them has a really tasty dressing on it. Staff is friendly, my only complaint is that sometimes when I order sushi it seems like the kitchen forgot about me but I always get my food eventually, can't blame them if they're super busy!"
10/19/2019,3,I am so sad. I've been obsessed with bento for years! When I would go to Orlando it's a must at least once a day. I've been going to the davie location since it opened. I haven't been since the summer since life got crazy but.... what in the world happened???!!!!!! The whole place felt different! The employees (young boys with crazy attitudes) looked so bored and annoyed. I wish it ended there. Then the food came...... what have you guys done!  everything was off point. The kids Katsu box portion was cut way down. My sons chicken was rock solid. The wonton chips now have a cinnamon thing and they tasted about 2 months old. My pao pao chicken was 50% fat and the lo mein that comes with my box was so cold and old tasting. My box portion also went down. This is the first time I've ever been let down by bentos. Ever in probably 8+ years!!! Please go back to how it used to be
6/26/2018,5,Bento is amazing! I ordered the pad Thai with tofu and it was so flavorful. I love that they have many vegetarian options! I used to eat here back in college in another location so I was getting all the nostalgia vibes. The pad Thai has not changed at all! I also loved how for Father's Day they give your father a free meal which is very nice! It was also very clean and centrally locates. Staff was helpful with all my questions from my family too!
6/5/2018,5,Sooo good! Great food and service. The food got to me quicker then I ordered. PLENTY of options. so it's perfect for those picky eaters or fit freaks in the group. Depending on what you order the portions are huge and every order includes like 5 sides and a sauce. one of my favorite Asian shots in the area.
1/2/2021,5,Amazing Poke Bowls. Great atmosphere. Loved every minute of it and the prices are good.
7/27/2018,5,"Whenever I am out shopping or looking for a place to eat after class, my first choice would usually be Bento! I love ordering either the Japanese Curry Chicken Katsu or the spicy creamy shrimp with noodles. For me, it has been difficult to find a place where Japanese Curry Chicken Katsu is both available and good! Besides ordering food, they also have bubble tea that is very good! However, plan your trip to Bento's carefully because they can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner time."
9/25/2019,5,Love this place. Always get the spicy cream chicken (the name is something different now). Only ate in once and it was decent. The food is what gets it 5 stars!
12/12/2017,2,"Bento smells amazing when walking by & is nicely decorated. This is the main reason we decided to eat here out of all the other options in the plaza. The line was super long but went by extremely fast. I was very impressed with all of the menu options (bento boxes have always had a special place in my heart) and of course the prices!I went with the red curry chicken bento. My mother had the yellow chicken rice bowl. Food comes out as it's ready. I received mine first & immediately unimpressed. My bento box was disappointing to say the least. Rice was under cooked, salad was soggy from too much dressing & tasted like freezer burn. The noodles were extremely dry & had absolutely no flavor. I was trying to enjoy the most edible thing in the box (red curry chicken) until my mom took her first bite & made a weird noise. I looked over as she spit out her chicken into a napkin & we both saw that it was completely raw. At that point, it wasn't even worth having them remake it....this place is what it is. The prices are very affordable for a reason. Food quality is very poor. I don't know how anyone could enjoy sushi from here. Sounds like a big risk to me. I like the concept but I just don't see myself trying another thing on the menu & being satisfied."
2/14/2019,1,My last few visits were a real downer.  Today when I arrived the restaurant had less than 10 tables occupied out of maybe 40 tables.I wanted to order sushi but since the staff was all working on a catering order for sushi the wait to order anything sushi related had over a half an hour wait.   If you order anything else off the menu that was non-sushi related you could have it in 5 minutes or less.I think I will take this place off my list...  No fast food sushi place is worth a half hour wait.  Sorry Bento...
12/21/2018,5,Best place to eat at. This is like my 4 time here and every time i eat here it's amazing the food is always warm. And no matter how packed the place is you don't wait more than 10 mins for your food really recommend this place
12/4/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is one of those lunch spots you can always count on to have awesome food.  Although I haven't tried much of the menu from my visits at this location, I always find myself coming back to the spicy cream chicken bento box combo! It comes out perfect every time! The quality and quantity of the food you get is definitely worth the price, sometimes I like to split half for dining in and then taking the other half to go.  Just a quick heads up though, the lunch hour rush is serious and get quite busy at this location, therefore the line can be really long and wrap around the restaurant."
11/26/2017,5,"I have always enjoyed bento boxes and really enjoyed their sushi options.  You place your order and they give you a number and bring the food to the table.  The staff is super friendly and there are a ton of different options.  The staff will also come around and pick up your trays when you are finished,"
1/12/2018,2,"I have heard nothing but high recommendations so I decided to give it a try. The line never got short yet it wasn't a long wait at all. The menu was overwhelming but in a good way. I ordered a custom bento bowl. Let me tell you, it was so delicious! I also ordered some seaweed salad and that was excellent too. Staff was super friendly. Hard to find a table. Super disappointed my last bite of salmon was rather large that's why I saved it for last. In the midst of chewing felt something sharp. I spit it out and there it was a huge bone not taken out. I was so scared because this could have cut my throat. This ruined the visit for me. Otherwise food tasted good. Scared minor details are being over looked in the food preparation since it's such a busy restaurant."
12/6/2018,4,"This place is great for quick and great food. We ordered 2 items and food was on table within few minutes. We ordered rice bowl with Veggie stir fry, pineapple fried rice and Thai iced tea. Loved the pineapple fried rice with tofu but rice bowl was ok."
3/30/2018,5,Bentos is one of my go to places! Service is always great and the poke bowl is so yummy! My favorite sauce to eat it with the poke bowl is spicy kobachi !
12/5/2018,4,Love this place for variety and quality! They never disappoint. Almost every thing that i have had here delivers and hits the spot. Thai tea is not as good though. I have had better at other places.
5/27/2018,4,"The first time I tried Bento was about a year ago. I have been back several times and each time the food and service has been great. If you enjoy a hip casual atmosphere and yummy Asian Cuisine, you should definitely give them a try. There is usually a line to order when you walk in, unless you get lucky or go at an off time like we did today. I recommend going for a late lunch or early dinner or just call ahead if you want to skip the line. The food is totally worth the wait though, and usually comes out pretty quick.The menu is double sided. One side features Sushi & Poke Bowls and the other features A variety of hot dishes from Stir Fry to Beef Soup. I have ordered from both sides of their menu and enjoyed a variety of Asian cuisine here. My favorites include the Vegetable Stir Fry with chicken or shrimp, and the Special Mexican Roll.Whatever Asian food you're in the mood for, Bento definitely delivers in a fun & friendly eatery."
6/16/2018,5,"I went to Bento earlier this week and was thoroughly impressed! I got a poke bowl with salmon, spicy salmon, avocado, spicy mayo, and other toppings. It was outstanding and very reasonably priced! They also have super cute Japanese bottled sodas and great boba!"
7/12/2018,2,"I ordered the ginger and scallion rice bowl that was supposed to come with red bell pepper, onion and snap peas. I didn't know I was going to get half of an onion, 3 slices of red bell pepper and 4 over cooked snap peas. Definitely disappointed in the bowl."
8/8/2017,4,"I really wish more places like this were around this area when I was going to college here. This place blows the cafeteria on campus out of the water.The place is pretty nice from what I could see. Definitely a high traffic restaurant and the parking situation is a bit hectic, so don't expect to be in and out on time during lunch. But the staff here does step up to keep the line moving a take your order quickly. Even took the time to explain the dishes since I was new to the place. I ordered the bento box with Mongolian beef and brown rice. Nice and tender but a bit heavy on the onions. The miso soup was good but very salty. Had to give up on it and finish the veggies.Overall, it is a decent and fun place to hang out and have a bite. I can see myself coming back here and trying some of the other dishes. Give it a shot. :)"
11/27/2017,3,"It was late and I was tired from a long journey. When I looked at the menu, for ""build your own bowl or drink"", there were hundreds of decisions need to be made . I was hungry and tired, would rather not to think too much. So I got a steak udon.  It tasted OK. The poke we had was also average. The service was quick and friendly. The ambuience looked modern but some of the tables were left unclean. The pricing wasn't particular cheap, the portion wasn't that big, the tasted of the food wasn't standing out. Overall, it was just an average experience."
1/5/2018,4,"Not bad, i would recommend this place if you are on the go since food is ready so fast and if you are not looking for anything too fancy"
8/24/2017,5,Bento Cafe is really nice. I got there around 11:00 am when they opened and a line had already started to form. I ordered the veggie roll and the Mexican roll. It was really good and fresh. The place is very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful.
5/16/2017,3,"I always see lines out the door of this place when I go to Trader Joe's so I finally decided to check it out. I ordered a poke bowl and added 2 extra proteins for $12. The bowl was good, not excellent and the quality of the tuna was decent. Prices are really check and the quality was ok. I can see this place being a trend for young Nova student's or families on a budget. I most likely will not be returning, but it was definitely worth trying out. Although, I may stop in next time for a bubble tea !"
1/12/2020,1,"Freaking sucks, they have never gotten my order right. They have given me a free meal multiple times but still somehow end up spend $25 on one meal. They always say they have something, but I do not receive it or its completely wrong. I went to get lunch again after they have been opened for 3 hours.... and they dont have udon noodles.... how is that possible thats as cheap as white rice. They have the worst management and the worst people working. Do not recommend!!!!!"
11/14/2020,1,"90 minutes later and we still haven't received our order from Grubhub.  Their driver's been waiting at the restraint for the last 40 minutes and they first told him the order would be ready in 10 minutes, which he texted me, and then later they told him they were out of one of the items I ordered but were trying to reach me on their iPad!  WTF!!!  The driver called me and handed the restaurant the phone to edit my order and they are now cooking the food.  Regardless of how good the food is the 2 hour wait for delivery and the dishonest staff will forever earn them a 1 star in my book!  Future diners beware..."
3/30/2018,5,I inhaled my food and not only because I was hungry but because it was so good! What I got was the flying dragon roll and shrimp fried rice. All of it worth the drive and fair on the price
6/18/2020,1,"My husband and I went here on Thursday June 18 and we were excited to finally get out and have a meal here. Upon arrival, the table that we sat at wasn't cleaned but we over looked that, but as we sat waiting for our food to come I went up to buy a drink and the cashier who wearing gloves said cards only we aren't accepting cash ,  then proceeds to touch my cups. As we sat eating and waiting for our other food we started noticing the small things like the server who brings out the food cleaned a table with a very dirty looking rag and never changing his gloves and give other people food and we noticed all of them had the same gloves . We spoke to the manager and she was apologetic but told us they change their gloves every 15 min  and only when they change tasks , well they ALL changed tasks the whole time we were there and did NOT change their gloves! When others people left ,the tables stayed dirty . I know you have to stay on top of the cleaning with the new rules and this establishment did not!  I would hope they realize that any one coming in could be sent there just to monitor how and if they are compliant with the new health care laws. Very disappointing! Clean up your act before you get closed down."
7/15/2018,5,Amazing food !! Definitely recommend the poke bowls and Pad Thai. Bento is for sure one of my favorite restaurants. Very good prices and great service.
7/28/2019,5,"I love this place for lunch! It's usually quite busy during lunch time but somehow the lines goes quickly and the food comes out even quicker. The best part is that the food is delicious and well made. I normally order a bento box which you can choose a protein like Mongolian beef or chicken etc. I've tried the Mongolian need and the chicken teriyaki. Both delicious! Along with that comes a little salad, some noodles, a little desert treat, a veggie like string beans and rice. It honestly is the best lunch meal. It's not an overwhelming amount of food but it's also enough to keep you full and satisfied. They also have boba tea with tapioca or boba. The price is not ridiculous either! I highly recommend you to try it out. You won't be disappointed."
1/18/2018,3,"Bento is a great Asian concept that offers fast-food like dining with traditional Asian plates plus sushi.  I feel the pricing is just right and I like the fact that they bring the food to your table.  The food quality here is above average for what it is and you can modify just about any plate on the menu.  Now word of warning to vegetarians and vegans:  even though tofu is offered, it will be fried in the same oil as meat so please keep that in mind as it is no longer considered an option (I wanted to thank the cashier for being honest about it)  There are salads and sushi options for vegetarians and vegans but it will be limited.  All in all a great little spot for a rather quick bite that should leave you happy."
7/11/2017,4,"I usually go here after classes or during lunch because it is close by. Every single time I get Spicy cream chicken with mini udon and I always love it. This place can be very packed during lunch time so make sure to plan your trip accordingly. I generally like the food here but sometimes it can be a hit or miss. My friend and I went here for lunch one time and she ordered korean beef with rice and the rice was raw. We had it sent back and she got a replacement of her food but they were being a little difficult. I think it was just that day that the service was not very friendly. But in general though the staff is friendly and I enjoy the food. The price is in the medium range, a bowl can cost about $10 dollars. They definitely have a good variety to choose from which is a plus for me."
6/25/2018,5,Great concept good good and portions nice ambiance and food choices. The bento box choices are superb. Clean restaurant wish there was one in Coral Springs or coconut creek
9/1/2017,5,"Watch out Pei Wei! This place deserves 5 stars as I have never imagined I could get a curry fix from a fast food place. For only $8 you get a very well portioned bowl with your choice of white rice, brown rice, or noodles. You also can choose your choice of protein and boy oh boy you get quite the selection. This time around I chose the Red Curry with chicken and brown rice. If you're a fan of spicy curry dishes I would highly suggest it."
7/20/2017,5,"This place is great. Been here twice since the first time. Many interesting beverage options that I thoroughly enjoy and their bento box is a nice variety, pretty big and filling. Great lunch/quick dinner place"
3/6/2017,4,"I'm not even going to lie, I'm a Pei Wei loyalist. Bento is however, much nicer interior and so much cleaner and sophisticated I feel like. Idk if its because this location is super brand new.Plenty of free parking because its in a big shopping plaza next to halal guys etc.Bento just might have slightly bigger portions or bigger plates idk lol. Great service. Staff was on top and good on follow up. Price range more or less the same.Ordered Mongolian beef here and it was served very freshly hot. Taste is ehhh I think Pei Wei mongolian beef is definitely way better and sweeter.Bentos crab rangoons were almost the same as Pei weis but Bentos is thickerIf there is anything I do recommend here is their spicy chicken with cream sauce or something. That shit was delicious.Oh and their white rice is very different here.Over all pretty good"
8/31/2017,5,"Really glad we finally have a Bento in South Florida! Used to eat at Bento with friends all the time in Orlando when I attended UCF. This location is really clean, quick service, and has awesome customer service. I would go in to detail about how delicious the food is here.. but just come out here and explore the food for yourself.I recommend spicy cream chicken rice bowl, Miami roll, and the steak is usually good here too! If you're in the mood for a slush.. ask for a passion fruit & lychee mix (I personally don't like Boba, so I get it w/o it... deeelish)."
1/1/2021,1,Took way to long for food to come out. I got my food after waiting 45 minutes my daughter did not get her food which all she ordered was a simple avocado roll. I WAS DONE WITH MY FOOD before hers even came out.Very bad service they DO NOT know how to serve.
9/17/2017,4,"I've been here twice and each time it was very crowded and I was in a rush so I couldn't stay and eat. The plaza this restaurant is located in is very busy and hectic to get in and out of. Add that to the fact that they are in close proximity to three college campuses and you get a very crowded restaurant. That's really my only negative and if I were being completely honest, it's really just a nitpick. The concept isn't original, but it's one that I love and I'm happy to see catching on. The service is really good as the food gets to you pretty fast. I tried the boba tea the first time I was here and loved it. The second time I tried the sriracha garlic chicken with udon noodles and now I'm officially hooked. I also apperciate that they give you the option to substitute tofu for any of the meats in their dishes since that means I'll be able to bring my vegan friend next time."
12/29/2017,3,"I had pickup so I can't really speak much on the dine in experience but I got a Korean shrimp bowl with an almond milk tea smoothie. The bowl was pretty uneventful. Not at all spicy and it was just... lacking something. The boba tea was good but that wasn't what I came there for! The ambience is very nice, the environment was buzzing. Seems like a nice place to sit down and eat so I'll probably go back and give them another go but try something different."
5/14/2017,4,"MmmMm Bentos! The taste of Asian Cuisine with variety of sushi rolls, noodles to rice entrees and delicious sides. Oh yea! Can't forget the Sweet Boba Teas. They have a modern look decor going on with plenty of table spaces for dining. It is seat at your own risk, so if you have a large group I suggest that someone from your group save that spot prior to ordering. The menu has 2 sides, sushi side and an entree side. It can be a bit confusing of how to order but the easy instructions up top the menu has the 1-2-3. So it can't be that hard :0)The dish I always get is the spicy cream chicken OR spicy cream shrimp with brown rice. I alternate here and there but these are my go to dishes. The spicy cream is not that hot; it has the spicy mayo base taste. Love love love it! The dish is balanced with a side of green beans. I tried to make the veggie at home but it was not the same at all. This had a crunch to it as you chew it and saltiness balanced the entree. A great Boba Tea to get us the Thai Ice tea. You can never go wrong with that! When never we make a family trip to Bentos, it's always an exciting treat for all of us!"
11/22/2020,3,Food was alright. I liked the atmosphere and customer service was good. The kitchen was clean and service was speedy. Thanks!
8/19/2020,2,I usually have a 5 star experience with bento but this was the first time I had issues. My wife's friend placed an online order at 5:50 pm and when I got there at 6:15 they couldn't find the order. We placed about an 80 dollar order and there seemed to be some confusion regarding the order once I got there. They couldn't find the name and just came back and said if it was under someone else. I showed them the screen shot of the order items and that the card was charged and I waited some more. Around 6:30 went and went back in again to see if they figured out the status of the order. They said the order scheduled for 6:40 pick up. I confirmed with my friend and it showed ASAP. Finally got the order almost an hour later while many of the people who placed their orders while I was waiting received theirs. Finally get home and there was some things missing and had to call them and drive back to pick it up. They're usually great I've been going since they've been in Gville and Orlando. First time I had an issue and usual have great experience but today was not good.
2/18/2018,5,"Crazy obsessed with Bento. It's an order and they bring your food to you environment. Every time I have gone, the service has been fast throughout the whole process. I'd say every time my food is at my table within 6 minutes or so. They are like ninjas at Bento while at the same time the food is phenomenal. There are many menu option from wok, to sushi, and poke bowls. You can also customize pretty much any meal you choose! Get the bubble tea too!"
2/2/2017,5,"I have been obsessed with Bento Cafe for years in Orlando. Every time I visited I had to go! I was thrilled to find out another location popped up and not too far away from me!This location is set up differently, with a quick service feel. i went during lunch and the line was massive! but trust me it's worth the wait!My go to has always been the SPICY CREAM CHICKEN omg it's amazing! Not too spicy and you can make it hotter if you want to. I usually go for the bento box which will give you rice, noodles, string beans and a little dessert. But I opted for the kids meal which is the spicy cream chicken, rice and string beans just a smaller portion. Then I wanted to try one of their sushi rolls and I was thrilled to find out they had boba! That milk tea with the boba inside is sooo yummy nice little treat!You order at the counter, the staff is nice and helpful then you get a number to put on your table. It didn't take too long to get the food delivered to your table. The food here is amazing! The spicy cream sauce is so tasty, I could put it on everything. The chicken is in small bites, not greasy or fatty at all. The cook their string beans with various spices so it really makes having your veggies enjoyable! I opted for the brown rice to make myself feel like I was balancing out the sweet boba tea. I went for a spicy crunch sushi roll to stay with a similar theme of the chicken. It was a good sized portion and lots of crunch sprinkles!Overall I had a great lunch and look forward to coming back again soon!"
7/11/2017,4,"What a great place.     First, it's large inside..didn't expect that when walking in.  Really nice modern decor.   My wife and I split two entrees..a poke bowl for spicy tuna and a roll that had no rice.   Everything was very very fresh.    2 days later I found myself wanting another 'poke' bowl.   So good and felt 'clean' (eating).   I just wish there was one closer to CS / Parkland area.    Maybe one day!"
8/18/2017,3,"Inexpensive, which is great. But the food is low quality. The sushi is not fresh and the noodles were undercooked. Bubble tea was good though."
11/15/2019,1,Rude ass manager MJ (mahali) was rude over some damn ginger ale this place doesn't let you customize your food either which i don't get even if you offer to pay additional Gave this place another try and it's just not it the guy who made my slushie went from cleaning straight to making my slushie without washing his hands and he was right by a sink i had to tell him wash his hands he didn't know i was watching they are unsanitary
9/23/2019,3,"So I went here with my friends for dinner the other night. The place itself is nice and clean. It was pretty packed when we went. However, the food was very basic. I got sushi and it wasn't all that tasteful. I only rated this 3 star based on the food taste otherwise the customer service was very good. They replaced my food for me because I had ordered uncooked salmon by mistake. But will I return here again? Probably not."
6/17/2018,5,This is my first time eating here! My daughter told me she would go to the Gainesville location back in college so I decided why not for Fathers Day. It wasn't packed which was great since I didn't want to wait for hours to sit down at a restaurant. Ordered a tofu sirarcha noodle and it was the best tofu meal I've ever had! Definitely will be back for more.
9/14/2017,1,"I visited the day before hurricane Irma came, as they were one of the few places to be open. Tried their cucumber avocado roll, it's was delicious! Went back to get the same thing after the hurricane, and I don't know if the food had gone spoiled without them knowing during the hurricane, but unfortunately I got food poisoning from the roll. I'm okay now, still recovering, probably won't go back though."
3/7/2017,4,"I have been the Bento is Gainesville, two of the locations in Orlando, and now this one in South Florida. For the most part, they were all pretty consistent with the taste and look of their  food.  The front of the house and food runners were all super friendly and quick.  When you come in you grab a menu and take a look at what you would like, then you go to the registers and order. They give you a number that you bring with you to the table when you sit. The drink fountain is towards the back along with silverware and napkins that you can get yourself.My sister had two strands of hair that were inside of the spicy cream chicken she ordered. We notified one of the employees passing by and he quickly went to get who I believe was a manager. She took care of the situation very quickly and gave her some edamame while she waited for them to remake her food.  Other than that situation, the rest of our food was great. My favorites from Bento are definitely the spicy cream chicken, red curry katsu, and their whole sushi menu.Great place to come with friends!"
12/9/2017,3,"Disappointed.. food is somewhat cold not that great very commercial. They sweep while customers are eating and there's also flies. :( On the positive note if you don't care about the latter, the line goes by fast and the service is great."
1/3/2017,5,"This is the place to go for quick fresh sushi on a quick lunch run. Trendy and clean in design and gives you the option to go for bowls, rolls or sashimi platters. It's conveniently located in Plantation Town Center shops and parking is convenient. Large seating areas either tables, long booths or by the sushi bar. Very quick service and friendly staff that brings orders to your tables. And the sushi is of course super fresh and delicious. My reason for making this place my favorite lunch stop for sushi."
10/24/2019,4,"Very good tasting sushi! I had the Flying dragon and a Cali roll. I love how you can customize things. I rate it a 4 because there was no ice in the vending machine and had to drink a room temperature water. But I would come back, great service."
6/5/2017,5,"I have to say this is a new all time favorite for some nice, quick, and delicious food.I went on Saturday and it was packed, but enough space where 8 of us where able to find a table. I went for dinner, so I am not sure how it gets during lunch.It does get full, but I went around 8pm and was able to find seating.Food: the food here is pretty good, I had the Sushi combo box, which allows you to grab two different 4 pieces, and 8 piece California roll; this comes along with some wakame seaweed and imitation crab. I also ordered the garlic edamame and they were also pretty good. I had family members that had the Poke bowl, Udon soup, and the Taiwanese rice noodles, and they mentioned it was pretty good as well.Price: the price range was not bad for what you get, $10 for 16 pieces was not bad, the edamame was a bit pricey for me, but it tasted good.The prices of the other items are not bad, because they do not cheat you out of portioning.The sushi is a bit small, but still very filling and delicious.Environment: the service is great, they will bring the food to you, they did take a big longer than usual to bring us our food, and the lady couldn't find us, but nothing outrageous. the restaurant is actually very spacious, and even though it gets packed, you do not feel as if you were cramped in there.Overall, this is a new favorite that I cannot wait to go back to.The price is right, the the food is good, and it is overall a nice place to enjoy."
3/30/2017,5,I'm a poke bowl conesueir. I found this spot a few months ago. Now everyone and their mom goes. It never disappoints. Fast friendly service and delicious food. Will be back again and again! Great prices!
7/22/2017,4,"Delicious. Tried something different each time and every time it's been very tasty. Tried noodle bowls, poke bowls, bento boxes, and sushi plates and all are good. Not 5 stars because the order takers/servers are pretty cold and have no personality....very impersonal. Kind of pricey too for lunch. But definitely going to be a regular place for us."
12/19/2016,5,"Bento has always been one of my favorites in college and I am so happy it is now in Broward. I can't wait until they expand more all over so I can eat it everyday. I will never get sick of the sushi and hot food for an affordable price. The ambiance and staff is well trained, quick and always ready. There's always a line out the door when I go though, but that's how good it is. It's relatively quick though."
2/1/2018,5,Its a cool little spot. Well lit. Pretty busy. The food is so good!.. it hot. It's fresh. It's fast. Well worth it!!
5/30/2017,5,"Konichiwa! this place is just great. Ordered a bowl mixed with salmon with tuna and was truly great. The prices are fair, fast service, great menu and selections. Had also some sushi and soup with no complaints. Finally found a place that i can come back regularly without having a bad experience. One of the most cool things is the Coca Cola machine that has all the flavors, i love that machine because it gives you different options on what to drink at the place. Cant wait to come back Thank you for existing !."
4/20/2018,4,"Good food, my main disappointment is the plastic sauce cups that come even with dine-in orders. It is very wasteful. Especially confusing since they had an earth day sign at the register  ...."
11/19/2019,5,"This is my favorite restaurant,we will come to eat once a week,the variety is also special.My mother and my son love to eat"
1/3/2017,4,"The second this place opened the lines were out the door and there's still a crowd. I've been to bentos up in Gainesville and Orlando and the only thing lacking at this location is the quality of the sushi. I like the sushi rolls at the other locations better. The place is really clean and a lot of seating available. My favorite thing to order is the spicy cream chicken; in a brown rice bowl, mini udon bowl, or a bento box. I go for the bento box if I want a little bit of everything and not be too full. The mini udon is really good but super filling. The portions are pretty big, so you'll be full and probably have leftovers. The curry katsu with red curry is pretty good if you want a bit of spice. The service is pretty good. It just depends on what time you go, but normally the food doesn't take too long."
7/9/2019,5,"I have eaten at several Poke spots in Fort Lauderdale area, but I still come back to Bento's Hawaiian bowl.  It is still my favorite."
5/16/2017,4,"I was hesitant about trying this place because a friend of mine had a bad experience there. The place is new and clean. You walk up to the register, order your food, and wait at the table for someone to find your number and deliver the food. I ordered the chicken and shrimp general tso bento box and it was delicious. The bento box included the protein, brown rice, noodles, green beens, a salad, and fried wonton pieces with a sweet sauce. The food was fresh and tasty. The portions are very generous and I was able to eat the rest for dinner. The fried wonton pieces were stale but over all, I had a good experience and I can't wait to try other items on their menu."
11/2/2018,5,"Fast-casual asian food done right! I've been to a couple Bento locations in Orlando and this one has to be my favorite. Whenever I can't decide what I want for lunch or dinner, Bento is my go to. I always call to order for pickup and it's seamless every time, usually ready within 15 mins or less. Everything is really efficient and food is great and reasonably priced. I'm a fan of their poke bowls, and spicy cream noodle bowls/bento boxes (think they call it pao pao sauce now). Definitely check it out if you're ever in the Davie area."
8/6/2019,3,"This is my second time eating here, first time take out. I was helped by a really sweet woman named Aleeha and the place was filled with lunch time customers but I was helped fast and waited less than 10 mins for my food. I went with the sushi bento box and a miso soup. The box came with a salad, some type of cold noodle dish, a california roll and four pieces each of the bagel roll and mt fuji roll. The rolls were pretty good and tasted fresh, the surprise was the noodles. They have a weird almost slimy consistency to them but they were delish. The soup was great, nice flavorful broth. The disappointment was my jasmine milk tea. I had asked if I could mix flavors with it and was told I couldn't so I just went with a standard jasmine milk tea with boba, one of my go to drinks. It was awful, I threw it all away. It was very bitter, no sweetness to it. I'll definitely be back to try their hot foods."
9/24/2019,2,"Bento has a fun vibe and some delicious food options.  However, I have had several negative experiences that prevent me from going back.  On two separate occasions, I was served potstickers that were frozen in the middle.  When I asked for another dish as a replacement, my request was refused as the cost was ""too much"".  Additionally, I have severe shellfish and peanut allergies that can be avoided if kept separate from other foods.  When I made that request, the cashier made no notation of it on my order, and I had an allergic reaction afterward.  I do not appreciate this lack of accommodation and have no desire to return to this restaurant.  Allergy sufferers, be on guard!"
12/13/2016,2,"This is obviously a chain restaurant, which I try to stay away from, especially when it comes to sushi. I knew this place had recently opened so I looked it up and decided to call in a pick up order. Thank goodness for that. This place was packed! there wasn't an empty seat in the house and there were several parties waiting to order in line. I made my way through over to the pick up area. Cashier was very nice. I payed for my order and went home.My fiance ordered a bento box. It had Mongolian steak (very fatty), ginger salad, noodles(tasteless), white rice, and another side. He also ordered a California roll and Miso soup. The Miso soup was delicious. I ordered the wakame salad and a Bamboo roll, which were both okay. Overall, it wasn't terrible, but I've had waaaaaaaay better sushi. I would have given it three stars, but our stomach aches afterwards forced me to give it a two."
2/10/2019,5,The bento box and poke bowl are amazing! Can't go wrong with any combination. I usually do the red curry shrimp bento or the spicy tuna poke bowl. Bubble tea options are great too!
4/22/2019,3,"This isn't bad for lunch but definitely wouldn't be my go to spot. There are definitely better places to eat at for Asian cuisine and this place was just mediocre to me. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Their bubble tea is a bland, definitely not worth the money I paid for. My friend got the Mongolian beef and it was too salty. I got the chicken katsu...it wasn't bad but I had better. The lomein noodles weren't that great in my opinion, it lacked flavor and seemed a little on the dry side."
3/7/2017,5,"Really yummy Asian food!!! Similar to pei Wei but with a lot more options! You order at the counter & then they bring you your food to your table. They have a full sushi menu with rolls, hand rolls, & ahi tuna bowls. They also have a create your own noodle/rice dish with various meat, veggie, & sauce options! I picked beef udon noodles with veggies & a yummy Szechuan sauce. The food came fresh and full of yummy flavor! The portions are a good amount & my stomach was left happy. Not to mention the cute cashiers... Lol highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner! Heard it can get really busy around lunch time."
9/17/2016,5,"So glad to see this place in SoFlo! Been eyeing this place with KC ever since the 'coming soon' signs were posted on their windows. To our expectations, it pretty much fulfilled every aspect of the other Bento Cafes we've been to up North, despite the hectic first week rush and new hirees!As soon as we walked in we were already in line. It was a full house, on a Thursday too! The line didn't progress as fast as we'd hope for but luckily we weren't starving. It's self seating so 'strategize' accordingly hahah.My usual is the Spicy Salmon and Tuna Bowl but instead I went for the 'build your own' and maxed out on their protein of 3. Here's my breakdown: White Rice / Salmon, Spicy Salmon, and Spicy Tuna / Avocado, Masago, Tempura Flakes, Wakame / Spicy Mayo, White SaucePortion was perfect for it's price (11ish) and I think I've found my new go-to! Okay maybe the bowl isn't new in comparison but I was uber satisfied. Had the Thai Tea with no boba and it was pretty solid. KC ended up getting her original favorite, Spicy Cream Shrimp with Mini Udon Noodles. It was my first time trying it and it was yummy as well. Tough decisions will be made next visit. She also had the Honey Dew Milk Tea with Lychee Jelly. It was too sweet for my taste and the consistency seemed a bit grainy. Midway of our meal the place emptied out and it seems like we just caught a wave at the wrong time. So in reality the wait isn't consistently terrible, at least for a weekday. Will surely be back for my poke bowl cravings and hopefully a Bento Blue emerges further South!"
12/27/2016,5,"I've tried a few different poke bowl places but this one is my current favorite. You can choose from a variety of different toppings to add on top of the bowl. I order the poke salmon and the fish is always fresh. There is plenty of seating inside the restaurant and never a long wait. They have a huge menu: wok stir fry, sushi rolls, bento box, poke, noodle and rice bowls. They also have a ton of boba tea flavors."
5/30/2017,5,"I was so happy to learn that Bentos opened down here! Back home I went to this place all the time. I usually order the bento box with the Mexican roll, cali roll, and Mount Fuji. Let me tell you about the Mount Fuji. Once you get this roll you will always order it. My husband even likes it and he HATES sushi so that should tell you something. My husband usually gets the teriyaki bowl with noodles and he always enjoys it. The food always comes out fast here so you don't want long to get it."
3/2/2017,5,"I loved the create your own poke bowl. The portions were big and the fish was fresh and delicious.The bento boxes were also huge.Everything was tasty and the place is clean and lively. Furthermore, the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.Eating here again is on my ""to do"" list next time I'm in Florida. There were many interesting items on the menu I'd love to try when I visit again.Now, if only they would open in NYC....."
4/21/2017,5,"Perfect spot for quick service Asian cuisine. There was a review that mentioned how long the lunch rush line was, and I have to agree with that. There was a long line, however, we seemed to come as the lunch rush was starting to go down so we were able to grab a table with no wait. They have a lot of servers picking up tables and cleaning them for a quick turnaround. The food was very good. I could taste good quality and it was freshly prepared. I had a sushi roll that was delicious, and my kids had chicken fried rice that they ate up entirely. Husband had a noodle bowl that was great too. All the dishes being served looked great and appetizing. We are happy with our experience and definitely plan on returning. Enjoy!"
4/14/2017,5,"This is the first Bento Cafe place I've tried. Its really tasty. The food is great A quality and tastes super fresh. Theyre busy with lots of Asians there, so from what I've heard that means the place is really good. :) Must try. Its like a tropichop for sushi!"
11/19/2016,4,"Dig it. Ordered the customizable poke bowl with greens and not rice. Chose 3 tunas (poke and spicy marinated and sashimi) plus scallions, cucumber and jalapeño with spicy mayo and ginger sauce. It was fresh and delish and i def wanted to order some sushi. The bobas are great too- i got jasmine milk tea without bobas- it was ice cold, refreshing and gigantic. Order at the counter and take your number to a table of your choice and your meal will be brought out to you. The line was long, but it sped by fast- service was quick and efficient and the place was nice and spotless."
4/6/2017,5,"Really liked the food, they serve a lot and it's a really big place. The only thing I don't like is the service; it was blah."
4/4/2017,4,"We were introduced to this place from my college cousin-in-law that always talk about this place on regular whenever she comes back from Gainesville. I finally got the chance to try it out in Orlando but i'll leave that for another day and another review. When I heard that this was coming to SoFlo they never told us about a Grand Opening. We heard thru the grapevine that people just started showing up for a ""soft opening"" so we went there and lines weren't that long at all but I'm always willing to wait if it gets to that extent.So my favorite dish to get here is the Szechuan Beef with the large Udon noodles. I's very tasty and not too salty at all. And the must try sushi is the Miami roll that is filled with krab delite, tempura shrimp, avocado, steamed shrimp and spicy mayo. Very filling.This is my place to go when I'm in the area."
7/4/2017,3,Food is ok. Service is questionable. The Asian lady with glasses and pony tail is not nice. I ordered Taiwanese beef noddle soup. It's very authentic and tasty. Bento box is so so. Boba tea is terrible.
4/7/2019,4,First time I took my daughter and got a kids noodle meal. It was horrible. Don't get that. It's definitely lower quality meat and noodles. It took me 6months to go back and try again. This time I told my kids to order from the adult regular menu. I got the pad Thai and enjoyed the spice. They each got a separate noodles dish and seemed to enjoy it better then the kids meal.
6/27/2019,5,My favorite. Love everything I've tried there and the price is great. Never get sick of it.
8/15/2019,5,"I love this place!!! My husband and I were in this plaza and we saw this place and decided to give it a try. The food was so good. There were so many options and the portions were good as well. I wish they would open one in East Fort Lauderdale or close to it. I would come here at least once a week. Oh, and their bubble tea, if you haven't tried it please do. It's good!!! Great experience!!"
4/4/2018,5,The food tastes great. They have bubble teas which I love. The bento boxes are the best though.
11/7/2018,5,"I first tried this place in Gainesville when I was in college so when I saw they opened a location I was beyond excited. we have gone a few times and time and time again it never disappoints. Their menu is vast, Service is fast and food is amazing. Must try!"
3/28/2019,4,"Great food, not loving the boba tea not sure if it's the flavor I got but it was extremely sweet. The food is delicious, great place for lunch. The bento box is one of my favs!"
12/7/2016,5,First time there tonight and I loved it!! Food was so yummy. Big portions and a great variety to choose from. From Asian food to Sushi. The service was great as well. Food came out within 10mins. Staff coming around to give you your food and picking it up when you are done is awesome.  Will definitely be back to try more things on the menu. So glad this opened up.
2/23/2019,5,"Bento is always my go to when I want fresh, healthy and cheap! We mostly order take out and they have never gotten our order wrong. We always order their build your own Poke bowls and double up on protein! Their garlic edamame is also delicious!"
1/11/2017,5,"Obsessed with Bento! Their sushi is fresh and delicious, and the couple other menu items I've had are also just as good. Pork Egg Rolls - very tasty, comes with a sweet Thai chili sauce to dip them in and it's a great balance on the salty/sweet + crispy texture. Mt. Fuji, Mexican, Philly, Cali rolls are all super fresh and oh so good! Their $10 combo box is a nice way to try a few different rolls each time but I can never get away from my favorites!Asian Cajun beef rice bowl is a hit with my husband, he typically asks for extra sauce, as they don't seem to provide enough otherwise but he loves it! Definitely recommend them for great priced food that is fast and delicious."
2/16/2019,4,I love this place to get something when you don't feel like cooking. It is fast food but good fast food. I love very spicy and they make your dish to your palate.   Convenient and good food.
10/1/2016,1,Worse experience!!!Even though there is lots of staff walking around the restaurant doing nothing andThey have three tills there was only one person taking orders with a queue all the way out the door I spent half of my lunch break putting an order in I had to to take my order to go by the end and had to eat it in a rushing in the car in the way to work. The concept is stupid and not efficient in anyway and that good wasn't that good either. Will never eat here again or by any means recommend it
12/10/2016,3,"Great ""chain-type"" sushi /noodle restaurant. Clean. Not smelly. Open seating. Modern. We shared a Bento Box and Sushi Roll. Reasonable or on par with most local prices. I didn't care for the ""tea"" or Boba. I'd go again. It's near Trader Joes, so it's a nice evening out. Go shop, then eat. TJMax, Ross plaza nearby. Family and date friendly. Can get busy since it's near the colleges, so folks in scrubs!"
10/1/2018,5,"I have owed bento cafe a review for a while now, I have been coming here for over a year now and the poke bowls are my addiction! Great quality food and consistent, it has yet to be gross. Employees are friendly as well, Keep doing what you do!"
1/31/2019,4,Just had a bomb spicy miso ramen! so good
11/17/2018,4,"Food is good. Sometimes they mess up your order though so check before you leave if picking up! Otherwise, great spot here in Davie."
11/3/2016,5,What is there not to like about Bento. My first time of many more visits! This place reminds me of Pei Wei but wayyyy better. I liked the casual dining atmosphere along with not having to place your order with a server. One of the things that is reminiscent of Pei Wei. Bento however has knocked it out the park with food options! Soo much to choose from not to mention all their Japanese tea offerings. I came in with fellow Yelper @ReixaC for lunch and walking in the place was packed with also a long line. Not too much to worry about bc the line moved quickly and before I knew it I was placing my order. I had the Korean Shrimp Bento box w/ a side order Garlic Edamame. We found seating at the community table and within 5-7min my food was in front of me. Talk about quick!I loved that my box had a little bit of everything! The  shrimp portion had lots of flavor and he green beans were crisp and not over cooked and the side salad was so fresh. Another great addition was a little treat of sweetness for after my meal. Kinda like a dessert which was crispy wonton chips with a sweet sauce. Nice way to top of the meal. Oh and the edamame was also very good and def garlicky.if you like garlic....check it out.
1/24/2017,5,"One of my favorite places for Japanese food. Every time I've dined here, the food has been delicious and fresh. The line is normally long and can be slow, but worth the wait. I recommend the sesame shrimp with lo-mein noodles and the vegetable spring rolls."
7/10/2017,4,"Great spot for your Asian fix. Has Japanese, Thai, Chinese, I think every Asian culinary staple. The Poke bowls are my personal preference here, with fresh fish and filling portions. Aside from the fresh food and hearty portions, the service is very good. Although mostly younger staff, very professional and willing to take care of any issue to assure you're satisfaction. The best part for any visual eater as myself is that their screens show their menu item. So wait long enough and I'm sure you'll see something you'll like. At times lines may be long, but food doesn't take long to get to your table and plenty of seating area all around."
9/23/2016,1,"The interior is not bad. The foods are nothing special and be tolerable. It may be presentable but commercialized fast food taste nothing to be proud of the origin of the dishes but a shame. Is pad Thai supposed to be served with no citrus and too sour? Even the orange chicken was too sour as well. Brown rice not well cooked. What a shame. If you cannot cook rice well then you shouldn't serve Oriental food. I would like to try the sushi but.... I hmm. Well if this is a fast food joint then I would give credit for being a bit ""upscale"" than regular fast food at the malls. Tea drinks are overprice with every scoop of powder only cost no more than 50 cents."
9/25/2016,1,"Tried to order take out over the phone and was denied 45 minutes to closing. The manager said that I'm welcome to come in and order in person. Hey manager, if you're still taking orders you should have taken mine. Tip: wait a few months when they get better staff and more business sense"
9/18/2017,4,"Great little spot in Davie, the service for lunch is quick and the price is good. For about 12-15 dollars you get a good size meal and the taste is very good. You just walk in place your order in the front and they bring your food to the table. I think their sushi is a bit on the small size but the taste is really good. You can mix and match almost anything with their bowls so you always get what you want."
10/15/2016,4,I'm not a big sushi guy but this was really good. Will visit a few more times before I flesh out a full review.
6/18/2017,4,Nice place for a quick lunch. Food tastes fresh and arrives quickly. Service is friendly. It gets packed and parking is tough to find during lunch hours. The poke bowls are great. Boba teas are also good. Will come again to try rest of menu.
1/13/2019,5,I go to school at FAU and wanted to check out local places that's when I stumbled onto this place. I love the food here and the service. I've never had a bad experience here. I usually go for the teriyaki noodle bowl and the krab wonton. They are spectacular. Sometimes i end up driving to this restaurant even if it is out of my way.
6/12/2017,4,"Best place for Poke' Bowl in town, hands down. The staff are very nice and helpful. The line to order will be long on lunch and dinner time but worth the wait. We always stop by after our grocery shopping at Trader Joe's or in the neighborhood."
2/16/2019,5,I really like their customer service. Even on their most congested days they are fast. Saturday/late lunch time. Should anything come up they are quick to remedy or help! I would like to particularly mention the manager there ESTEBAN. Very professional and extremely courteous when something I had ordered wasn't what I expected. Managers with Esteban's type of customer service skills and prompt attention will run a great restaurant. Very hard to find this kind service anymore. I will return!
6/3/2017,5,"Excellent food, great environment ! Like the poke with poke soy sauce! Matcha boba tea is one of the best I have tried in the area."
4/19/2019,5,"Bento is wats so fresh and fast service.  Love the special Mexican roll or the veggie roll. Sushi is always amazing . Honestly any of the bowls are great , noodles or rice and love that you can get veggie as protein.  Very vegetarian friendly!"
1/31/2017,4,"I've only been here a few times because I've stopped dining out as much as I used to. I went in when they had just opened it and it was a little overwhelming. The noise of all the customers and commotion was a bit too much for me to handle, so I decided to take it togo. So after looking through their giant menu and not being able to decide what I wanted, I figured to get a little bit of everything with their bento box. It was fantastic!I've been back a few more times and I really do recommend the poke bowl! You can customize is however you like and the portion is great. The marinated tuna and salmon was fresh and tasted fantastic. The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was that it is slightly overpriced (it is almost impossible to spend less than 10 dollars here, for one plate)  and that the atmosphere isn't the most welcoming as well as the ridiculously long menu."
9/17/2016,4,We've been waiting for this place to open! Ok so we went around noon. The line was wrapped around the store. There was s nice girl at the door passing out menus and explaining the menu setup. The line moved fairly fast and when we got to the register another nice girl explained further because we still had some questions. I had the pineapple Thai fried rice and a vanilla milk boba tea. All together it was $12 and some change. Will be back to try other items. The decor is nice too.
9/15/2016,5,Previous fan of BENTO from going to school in Gainesville. So excited that they have opened one down here! Food is delicious as always and they have bubble tea as well. The restaurant has a really cool vibe inside and the staff are all super friendly. No complaints happy to see they're off to a great start down here!
4/14/2019,2,"Today I went in and they were out of milk tea for bubble tea. No big deal if it's the first time, even a second time I can understand that things happen. However, this is probably the fifth time I've come in and they have been out of milk tea in the past 6 months. It's a business that serves food; act like it."
3/17/2017,4,"Super quick, barely had to wait for the food despite a decent crowd. Sesame chicken was alright and the food could have been warmer but overall it was good!"
7/23/2017,3,I just don't really see what all the hype is about. The food was average sushi that you'd get anywhere at the same price except the rolls were kinda small to me.
5/30/2020,5,"Overall great place, food is good (though not great, meaning for an average meal you won't be disappointed), I go here often and am never disappointed. I would avoid the sushi, not that it's terrible, but if all their items the sushi is my least favorite. They have great rice bowls and really good bento boxes, my favorite is the pineapple chicken. I eat here about once a week and always happy with my experience."
9/20/2016,5,This place is so so good!! You get so much food for an amazing price! I recommend getting a poke bowl! For $11 you can get 3 different kinds of fish! And you get a lot of fish for your money!
12/15/2018,5,"Bento is my favorite place for any Asian fusion dish. They are my all time favorite poke place in south Florida for the price and quality of the poke bowls. They also have good sushi and also entre options. They have great boba drinks too. Besides Hawaiian, Japanese, and Chinese fusion options, they also have pad Thai. If you like Asian food you have to try this place."
1/28/2017,4,"A great addition to Davie food offerings!  All the food here is amazing. Sushi, noodle bowls, rice bowls, poke, etc. Also, Boba tea is delicious!!!   So many flavors to choose from!  I have eaten here many times since they opened and the place is a keeper.  The only reason they did not get 5 stars is that the restaurant is always blasting the air conditioning. I'm a big guy and I'm so cold in here.  I recommend that they up the temp a few degrees and this place would be perfect"
10/20/2016,4,"First time here today for lunch. Long line, but it went fairly quickly. Ordered the build your own poke bowl, which I loved. The prices were good, and it was super filling. I'm obsessed with bubble tea, so I ordered one. Sadly, I was disappointed. They don't have almond milk for their milk teas, and they don't have certain flavors either. I ordered the mango passion fruit green tea smoothie with boba. Way too sweet. I will definitely come back for the food, but I'll stick to M&H for the milk teas."
1/1/2019,5,"First time here and it was well worth it. My mom and I ordered a bento box with shrimp, szechuan style and a sushi combo box with the caliente roll and mt fugi roll. Both orders were great! The flavor was there and let me just say the szechuan shrimp was the perfect mix of flavor and spice. The staff was friendly and they were very accommodating. It's a busy location so just be on the look out if you're a big group."
5/16/2019,3,"The food is OK but the service, attitude for no reason. Sam took my order and it seems like she is NOT happy with her job. If you work as a cashier taking orders you would think she would be patient. I was ordering two bowls at the same time and was not aware she could only input one at a time, half way through with a nasty attitude tells me she can only do one. As I give me second bowl description and ask if I can do brown rice, she simply stares and passes a menu, OK...thanks yes, I would lie brown rice. No smiling, no people skills, nothing. She can be quick with orders but without the customer service aspect of it, it's nothing. Bummer."
11/2/2016,4,"Have gone here for lunch twice. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The food is ok. Somehow it tastes and feels like what it is, fast food Japanese food. Good enough to go back though. For exactly that, fast food Japanese food."
6/6/2018,5,"Love this place! It's delicious, fairly priced and fast! I usually order the poke bowl with salmon and brown rice or the pad thai with tofu. Both dishes are great! There are nice amount of options to choose from on the menu. The staff is always helpful and efficient. It gets super busy in the evenings on Friday & Saturday nights and at lunch time during the week. I recommended calling your order in and picking it up."
4/26/2019,5,Been here multiple time with my boo. When we feel like eating Japanese food. This is the first that comes up to our mind. Great bento!!
8/8/2018,5,"First time coming about a week ago, the guy really had the patience to explain the menu well to me. He recommended the poke bowl and I was super thrilled.The food is amazing and so is the service! A friend recommended this place and I'm glad she did. I'll definitely be back"
10/5/2016,4,"As an asian girl from California, I'm so excited to have this place in Davie! The range of menu items, fresh fish, & ability to customize your order is everything to me.Overall this place is awesome. Only critique is my boba was undercooked & my katsu curry bowl could have used a more proportionate serving of sauce as it was barely enough to wet my noodles (lol).The staff are all really friendly, although the food does seem to take a long time for such a highly staffed joint. Again, not a huge deal.I'll keep coming back!"
5/1/2017,5,"Great concept, and very convenient location.  Took the family on a Saturday night, so it was a little crazy inside.  I love Poke, and ordered the salmon Poke with jalapeños, red onion, edamame, and cucumber (they were out of avocado).  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  My wife ordered a Thai noodle with steak bowl which was also testy.  My son had a kid's chicken teriyaki and my daughter order the garlic chicken and broccoli.  We also ordered a side of steamed pork dumplings.  The chicken teriyaki was a little overcooked (or we just got some of the end pieces which had dried out), but he loved the sauce and portion was good for a kid's size.  All four of us loved the place, and will definitely be back soon."
12/13/2016,4,I am not a huge fan of asian cuisine but this place is good and the service is usually quick. It is right by NSU and BC so it does get packed during lunch time! I haven't tried much on the menu but recommend the spicy cream chicken!!
4/4/2020,1,"Ok I guess quarantine means less portions and terrible quality because the meal I got today was not what I usually get. Even my young son noticed the difference.....and now my stomach is feeling terrible. So disappointed, will not be going back."
9/21/2016,5,"Just incredible ... All I can say is DO NOT Miss this place !!!Being from NYC & very discerning when it comes to Asian food which there are many  authentic varieties.This place is spot on.Fresh and full of flavors.The staff are lovely ... After your order is in ... You have a seat and its brought to your table as each dish is ready , fresh & it's hot.Again , staff are friendly, helpful & with big smiles .This was an all around very joyful experience ...We will be back , again and again"
1/11/2017,4,"I've been of fan of Bento ever since I tried it in Gainesville years ago. Naturally, I was very excited to hear that they were opening up one in South Florida. This place looked really nice. The decor looked very modern and the service was good. The food was delicious and was prepared rather quickly. One evening I placed a call-in ordered and when I went to pick it up, they gave my food to the wrong person. I had to wait about 20 mins for them to remake my order. But the food was great as usual so I didn't mind all that much."
7/6/2017,5,They have the freshest sushi in town!Excellent food & great service:)The prices are fair and portion size is good!Highly recommend this sushi place.Though parking is hard to find because plaza is always crowded. That would be the only down fall. Over all worth the trip!
5/15/2018,1,"Disgusting!  Flies on soy sauce bottles at our table, steak rubbery with odd texture and off/going rancid flavor.  Literally only 6 broken pieces of soggy green beans in the bento box.  Got our sushi order wrong and gave allergy food we told them couldn't have.  It was good the first time we tried it but this recent visit will definitely be our LAST!  Grateful we didn't get food poisoning."
3/26/2019,4,"Every time I dine here I always receive quick service which is good if you are on a break or in between classes, the prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly, but this isn't a place for you if you want a true authentic cuisine."
10/17/2016,5,I was so excited for this place an let me tell it was exactly what I was expecting and more. Omg delicious !!! I had the bulgogi beef rice bowl
3/16/2019,2,"We first tried Bento in Gainesville and loved everything about it. We were excited when a location opened up nearby. Sadly, the food here is just okay. Servings are smaller and sloppy in presentation. Always crowded though with grad students from the local college. It's worth a try, but their Gainesville location is far superior."
10/9/2016,4,"First time at Bento Cafe.  Love the concept - affordable, great quality food. The portions are generous and it appears the quality of the ingredients are top notch.  I appreciate the number of options and how you can customize your bowls/boxes.  My husband and I arrived on Sunday - late afternoon and ordered a sesame rice bowl with steak, tuna/salmon Don, and a sushi combo box (to share) - Mexican and Special Mexican rolls. We were not disappointed.  The con: with the number of employees they have, we expected much faster service when ordering.  We stood in line (that stretched back to the door) for 18 mins before we made it to the front.  They had 2 tills open at the time, although you could see other employees standing around."
9/29/2018,5,This is an awesome and cool fast food Asian restaurant is part of my ritual . The pad Thai is very good and also Miso soup. Food portions are reasonable and the combination possibilities are endless. I simply love BENTO!!!
9/17/2016,5,"Love this place in Gainesville, but I love it even more here! From the moment you walk in a friendly face greets you and asks if you need help figuring out what to order. I was able to easily customize my order and it came out quickly. My boyfriend ordered something he ended up not liking and the manager quickly stepped in with a kind smile and helped us right away. Every single person I encountered that worked there was very friendly and helpful.  I look forward to coming again!"
11/11/2018,5,This is a great place for a quick Asian food. The food was well presented and the taste is a 5 star taste. The service is friendly and the establishment is extremely clean. If you want fresh and quick Asian food I advise you to try them you won't regret it.
4/18/2018,5,Can't never go wrong with good ole bentos. This was a stable in college when going to gainsville then in tallahasse. So happy they made one here in Davie. It's just as good as the other locations. My go to is the red curry with EXTRA chicken. As the base I go for the mini udon noodles. I highly recommend!!
8/13/2018,4,"Their food is OK, but nothing to write home about.  I've felt it lacks in flavor at times. I had their pad thai a few weeks ago and I wish it came with a little lime wedge. (I asked for some but they didn't have any). But their service is great and staff is always friendly. Cute place to grab lunch but be prepared to wait a while during lunch rush hour (between the hours of 11:45-2pm)."
6/21/2018,4,The food was great and the staff was accommodating and the atmosphere was very relaxed and inviting
2/25/2019,3,"I used to come here all the time but after so many order mess ups, I rarely come. I just ordered a shrimp fried rice with steak to go cause I was in a hurry and my bowl had no steak. This isn't the first time they've messed up and now I paid an extra $3 for joyI emailed them that say day and haven't gotten a response. Horrible customer service"
2/25/2019,4,"When in Davie, Bento is the perfect lunch or dinner stop. It's located in the middle of the Tower Shops and parking by the restaurant can get a little crazy, so I usually park in a more empty lot. This is probably my favorite place to grab some sushi and Bento's food really changed my perspective on sushi. The place does get very crowded but service is super quick. You wait in a line to order between a sushi combo box, create your own poke bowl, some kind of bowl and much more. Once you order, they provide a number for you to place at the table you're seating at. No long than 10 minutes later the food with start to arrive. The sushi rolls are made right in front of the customers which I find entertaining to water when I'm waiting. They do have drinks provided in a little fridge by the registers but they also have different Boba Teas with either milk and green tea and regular fountain drinks too. My go too is usually the sushi combo back with your choice of two different 4 piece rolls and served with a 10 piece California roll. Never forget to ask for side sauces because they are free but the spicy mayo makes everything taste better."
7/10/2017,5,Good fast food asian restaurant! Wide variety of plates to choose from at a good price
7/3/2018,5,What a great find! Had a couple of rolls and a bento box. All was delicious and a great value. Very clean space and speedy service. Overall - excellent place. I'm just sad there isn't one closer to my house!
10/21/2018,5,Love this little gem! Food is bomb and so is the ambiance. Super cute place with great food and great /fast service. General tso is to die for along with the boba teas.
12/17/2018,5,Great food. Fast service. Don't forget your free extra sauce side. If you go with kids they have an awesome kids meal and don't forget to ask them for the kids chopsticks.
3/17/2019,1,"Very slow service, we waited over 30 minutes in line, unprofessional service and no management or supervision"
12/9/2018,5,Bento is one of my favorite places to visit in Tower Shoppes. I always go for the poke bowl with salmon and tuna...and it never disappoints. Their boba tea options are endless and so delicious! The workers are always so friendly and make the experience that much better. Definitely a must visit for sushi lovers!
12/4/2018,3,"The poke bowls are great, the Katsu japanese curry is great, the spicy noodle soup was nasty, and their bubble teas( especially the fruit flavored ones) were bad. Everything else like noodles, udon, sushi, fried rice were ok...."
8/29/2018,3,"We started going to Bento right after they opened. My husband and i fell in love with the place! We were eating there 3/4 times a week. But alas, gradually the food got very inconsistent, the orders came out wrong. Now we get take out once a week or so. Every-time i tell my husband to check everything before you leave! As i write this my brown rice stir fry chicken bowl has white rice and the pieces of chicken are so thick i have to cut them all. We constantly dont get the sauce we ask for. I usually get the Poke bowl with spicy tuna on salad, not rice. One time they gave me regular tuna and when I asked about it i was told that's how they do it now, which is not correct.  The amount of salad has also gone down to a very small amount. I used to get it with tofu, but the last time i did, the tofu was hard like a rock and again i was told that's how they do it now. Prepped items are different all the time. Wrong wrong wrong most of the time. Sadly, probably by another few months we wont be eating there at all anymore.  I Hope management reads this and correct the inconsistencies because it really is a great addition to our area and if done correctly can continue to have a very good businessChecking back. Bento, your response telling me to get in touch through email. Seriously, your place is being run down. I suggest YOU get in touch with your employees. We've been back a couple times. Just picked up dinner and posted a picture of my udon soup. Unfortunately the forgot the udon part, just doubled up on broth as you see in the photo. When i called i get the usual apology. What good is an apology when you cant have dinner unless you want to make another rush hour drive after work to rectify another Bento screw up. What a waist of millions of dollars to open a great concept and let it turn to crap. On another note, the flies regular and fruit are a serious hazard that closed down another local restaurant this week."
11/6/2018,5,Always quick service.Food always tastes great. South Florida is lucky to have this restaurant. You won't be disappointed to eat here and will want to come back!
1/19/2019,5,"Where have you been, Bento!!! I just love this restaurant, super service, great affordable meals!!"
1/12/2019,3,The poke bowl was good not great. The ordering process was difficult and annoying. They could use better training with their staff and add more protein to the bowl.
10/16/2018,4,"Food is good...BUT beers shall/must be cold! Adding ice on a cup is not the proper solution, Miss Cashier...it is against the Caveman's Law!!!. Ice them on a cooler prior to put them for sale...AND keep them cold...specially on a Friday night."
11/15/2019,4,"I really love this place. I come quite often. I usually get the spicy cream chicken in a bowl and love every bite. However, I can't give them perfect 5 star rating since the meal I get comes with very little sauce, not even enough to coat all the rice, and they charge $1 for even a little extra sauce, a little ridiculous if you ask me. Sometimes it's difficult to find a place to sit and eat because it's always so busy, but I don't mind that. Other than the sauce thing, I've never had a problem."
1/4/2019,4,"I really enjoy the place, it has a meal for everyone here. My favorite is the poke bowls, the fish they use is pretty fresh; for the price too I'm impressed. I've also had the sushi, the dumplings are pretty decent, and lastly, the hot meals are awesome. The menu is pretty large, it is somewhat overwhelming to order there sometimes lol. They have these teas, I do not like sweet stuff. But my friends love them, so if you're into sweet stuff a lot you'll love it."
6/23/2018,3,Great fast food concept. Food is mediocre. I tried this chain first in Gainesville years ago and I wasn't impressed. My coworker wanted to go here last week so I decided to try the location in Davie and still years later I am still not quite impressed! They do give you large lunch portion. I am not a big eater so I prefer quality over quantity.
1/23/2018,5,"I first had Bento Cafe when I used to live in Orlando so when I moved to south Florida I was naturally excited when I found out a location was opening up closer to me. It's somewhere I can go to grab a quick bite or whenever I  just want to meet up with friends. Its also very convenient when I have no time to cook and grab some to-go for home. My top favorite menu items are definitely the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl with mini udon, Korean noodle bowl with mini udon, or their poke bowl with spicy tuna or spicy salmon."
6/16/2018,5,"I'm generally very picky about Asian food and restaurants, but this place really hit the spot- rich flavors. I love the Bento Noodle Bowls- almost all of the ones I tried are great. I like the casual setup and quick service. I'll definitely be back here."
8/27/2018,5,"Best Japanese Cafe Ever!!!! Totally Recommend! Best place to relax! Best food in the world if you are looking for Japanese food, this is the best to go!"
4/14/2018,5,LOVE Bento Cafe! Great quality sushi for a moderate price. Large portions that seriously satisfy any craving! You will NOT be disappointed!!
6/3/2018,5,Ate here for first time today.   Everyone's food was good.  Prices are reasonable.  Staff friendly.  Wish one was closer to me in Ft Laud.
9/24/2017,2,"Two stars because I love this place. Food is good, service is 50:50. The person I ordered with put my name down as Jim and not Kim. Took a few extra steps to find my order. Next my order yesterday had two long black hair in it. I was so grossed out. Never ever had that happened to me at bentos. Not even sure if I want go come back now."
5/26/2018,5,"Delicious and fresh, I had sweet and sour chicken with lo main noodles and lychee water so yummy. Will definitely be going back."
7/24/2018,5,Fresh and fast service. Love the variety in the menu. Just wish they were more straightforward with what foods have MSG and which don't. SO I always have to ask and make sure they ask the manager as most of the people taking the orders aren't sure. But other than that its amazing!
11/30/2019,5,Had an amazing experience with Maria! She was so kind and helpful despite the restaurant being PACKED. Love the food and service!
1/21/2017,5,"I had never been to this restaurant before, but I was impressed upon arrival. As soon as we entered the establishment we were greeted by a smiling staff member who gave us menus and told us we could find a table to sit at while we decided to order.As I had never been to this restaurant before, I asked the staff member what I should get and they suggested a variety of their popular dishes. I decided to order the spicy cream chicken bowl which was a wonderful decision. The price was perfect for my budget and the serving size was large enough to make two meals out of it, so I enjoyed it the following day for lunch! When ordering our food the service was speedy and kind. The staff checked up on us throughout our meal to ensure everything was running smoothly for us, and the bathrooms were very clean! Overall I had a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go again!"
7/8/2018,5,"Love this place. I always get sweet and sour chicken, but my wife tries something different every time and asks lots of questions. The cashiers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Ali is super awesome."
7/7/2018,5,"This is my favorite restaurant!!! I always order the honeydew milk tea with popping lychee pearls. It's amazing!! The food is honestly the best. The quality, flavors and price is on point! I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves sushi! Next time you visit, try the TNT roll and the spicy cream chicken. It's phenomenal. You will not regret it."
1/3/2017,5,"The best, the best, the best, the best!!! Food cooked amazing every single time!!! I have been a patron for the last 10 years. When I lived in Gainesville this was my go to place almost every day, and when I moved to Ocala I drove at least twice a week to treat myself after a long day at work. When I moved to Miami I was almost sure if never get to eat there again. Then I moved to Ft. Lauderdale 4 years ago and just this past summer they opened up a location here...of all places!!!!! The food was exactly how I remembered as well as the amazing customer service!!   This place is a gem and Ft. Lauderdale just got that much better!!!"
4/9/2018,5,I definitely enjoy Bento! The food is usually delicious and the service is pretty much on point. They will bring your food out quite quickly and are always going around to remove any plates not needed!
10/9/2018,5,Great concept! This place is clean and the menu has great food choices! Highly recommended!
5/7/2017,4,"I came here while actually going to check out another restaurant, but this place caught my eye. Then I looked on yelp and saw the review of a few yelp friends and they were good and had great pictures. I decided to give this place the Ole yelp try and see how it stands up. I walked in to glance at the menu and was welcomed by not 1 but 2 ppl. I decided what I wanted and waited in line for maybe 10 seconds before being served fast service indeed. I ordered the Korean box with chicken and brown rice. I recently been to a Thai Korean place in Tallahassee so decided this is my go to option. The  box comes with a ginger salad of cucumber, and carrots and lettuce in a ginger dressing very tasty good to clean your pallet when changing between the different box options. The box also came with green beans  and noodles and what I belive to be a milk type dessert with  hard noodles I can't seem to think of that name as it was not listed on coming with the box but is a great part of the box very tasty.  I also tried the boba tea passion fruit and lychee pops. This was good but the ice got in the way of the boba the only down side to the tea, because the boba were small they were out of the bigger ones. This meal all for about 14$ the food it's self is 9.50  which is a good deal and very filling with the healthier options then regular Chinese food places. This place is fusion btw. I was saying it's fairly good for a quick lunch. My only concern was the meal wasn't so hot but yet warm, was cooked fine and warm enough to eat but not hot. I would like to try some of their other options as they also sell sushi and such. If your in the area and want something fresh give them a try, the box is the best option in my opinion just from my meal and what I saw as others, you get more food this way as well."
6/23/2018,5,We have been her twice now and everything we have ordered has been great. It's been busy both times but the service was fairly fast. This has become our favorite place to get sushi.
9/20/2017,1,"My friends and I use to come here a lot because we loved their food and service. Today we had the worst experience. First, they don't have the sushi with coconut anymore ( don't remember the name), it was one of the best. Then, the cashier was rude and had a terrible attitude. They were offering a special half off the spicy cream chicken rice bowl. I ordered to go and I couldn't because it was only for dine-in. Also, I order a side of spring rolls, which the menu specifies 3 rolls, I only got two and when I asked for the other one I was given the excuse that they were two because they were bigger. That, they don't specify on the menu. It was four of us ordering to go, around $50 in total, and we also we noticed portions to go are way smaller. All of us are super disappointed and go back. This is not the place it used to be!"
8/6/2017,4,I used to go all the time when I lived in Orlando so finding out they opened one down here was so exciting! I love about 30 minutes away but it is worth it. My go to that is an absolute must is the spicy cream chicken bento box. They give you a great amount for the price. The sauce is so hard to explain. It has a little kick to it yet sweet and creamy at the same time. The string beans that come with the box is surprisingly really good!
3/24/2018,5,Super quick service even when the line looks long. Food tastes great and is relatively inexpensive.
6/8/2018,5,"Love this place! Food is always fresh, hot and fast. So much to offer. Always look forward to visiting when I'm in the area"
10/25/2017,5,Such a great little sushi place. I was passing through the shopping center and really wanted soup and sushi so I yelped (of course) and this place popped up. The reviews seemed good so I gave it a go. Definitely a cool spot. Took my food to go but the soup was great and the sushi was fresh. Quick service and quick takeout too. Definitely recommend this place.
10/30/2019,1,"Honestly i'm just so disappointed, i've been coming here for years and today i walked in and was going to order chicken fried rice but they said they didn't have any made and then charged me the full price for shrimp that i don't even want. I asked for the manager Maria and instead of making it right she simply just said we don't do exchanges and proceeded to just walk away."
5/14/2018,5,"I am in love with Bento, I have never gotten food from here and been disappointed. My only complaint is sometimes the wait time is a little much but the food is quality and worth it."
8/26/2018,4,"Very nice management.  Coming from the Pacific, we found Asia-Pacific (especially Japanese) cuisine somewhat disappointing in S. Florida.  Still, we have no interest in trashing someone's business, and admire people who try to make things better.  We wish the business much success!"
11/5/2018,5,"Bubble tea!!! Also a varied menu, delicious food and quick service. The staff is always very pleasant."
11/15/2018,4,"So yummy and fresh. I've never been here that it wasn't delicious, although they seem to be out of Ramen quite a bit. That's the reason for the 4 stars and not 5. Other than that...perfect!"
7/30/2018,5,"Always satisfied with Bento. Great place for lunch or dinner & their sushi is yummy. I think the quality is worth the price of their sushi. But I think the bowls are kinda expensive for the amount of food you get.  Overall good quality, tastes fresh."
10/25/2018,5,"The poke burritos are amazing, but sometimes the ratio of ingredients inside the burritos aren't consistent. I have only had this deliver via UberEats, but I am looking forward to checking out the restaurant in real life sometime soon!"
11/19/2017,4,"I want to hate this place since they built it on top of what was once a great weekly car show spot but I can't. The food was really good, the portions were, in the words of my father ""man-sized"" and the service was pleasant. You can't ask for more from a restaurant."
9/21/2018,4,Food and service is great. $0.50 for a side of Siracha is silly and a turnoff. *docks point*
9/15/2018,5,"This place has the best prices and the best poke bowls.  Call ahead and order your meal by phone and it will be waiting when you come in.  This place gets busy, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes during lunch hours or dinner hours if you don't call ahead."
6/30/2018,1,"Went to eat on Friday and place is infested with fruit flies. Disgusting! I lost my appetite the moment I looked at the wall and all you see were little black dots, all fruit flies."
8/12/2017,5,"Alright, so this chain restaurant started up in northern Florida, and this is the new and only south Florida location (so far)! I gotta say my first experience here was awesome!!! The staff is super sweet, our drinks and food came out quickly (around lunch hour), and the aesthetics inside are very pleasing! This was my first time at this chain, while my boyfriend had been to the Orlando location, so he helped me out with ordering although it's not hard at all, (I just tend to freak out around unfamiliar menus) I decided on the Asian Cajun noodle bowl w lo mein and chicken (I like a little spice in my life) and it was absolutely delicious! I also tried my boyfriends teriyaki chicken noodle bowl (teriyaki is always his go-to) and it was also scrumptious! What they do is give you your meat and noodle of choice, along with whichever sauce or seasoning your heart desired, but on the side in a little plastic dish. This is so you can add as much flavor as you please. I  poured all of my sauce in at once -because I'm just saucy like that, but it's still a nice concept! I loved what I ordered, but next time I will definitely go a little crazier (like some Poke!!!) They also have bento boxes, rice bowls and yummy sushi! Along with our noodle bowls we ordered 4 pieces of their Unagi rolls, and man they were so fresh and flavorful!! These were some quality eel rolls!! We wanted to get more, but figured we better not (kinda regretting it). Lastly, we of course had to order one of their many choices of boba tea. This is where I started sweating when ordering, because there are just too many combinations that I want to try *crying face* but sadly I cannot order them all at once (or so my boyfriend says I can't) and so my final decision came down to the passion fruit green tea with strawberry popping boba, and my boy ordered a strawberry milk tea with mango boba, both superrrrrr delicious! (My boyfriend and I agreed that we will be coming back in the near future for boba tea runs). Honestly I plan on this being my go-to Asian restaurant for the moment! It is seriously a great place for a nice fast-paced yet relaxing lunch or dinner! This is a place you bring your friends, fiancé, in-laws, cousins...anyone you're quite fond of! Because they'll be having a proper meal!"
3/11/2017,4,"Definitely enjoyed this place for a 1st try! The service is Extremely fast, and they staff is very professional and courteous! It's no P.F Changs but not bad for a quick chipotle-like-meal"
8/26/2017,4,"So excited to have a Bento down here in south Florida! I have gone to the other restaurant chains in Orlando, and thought they were all super delicious. The great quality about Bento is the available customization. They have lots of dishes to chose from, cooked, fried, raw or fresh. The sushi is really fresh, even though I didn't have a sushi roll, but I had the poke bowl. I wanna try more of their fried/cooked items. But everything looks really great, and I'm so happy with the fish and dish I did have."
9/18/2020,2,"I don't normally write reviews. But I have to say, I love Bento. The food is great. HOWEVER, the last 4 times...yes 4...my order has been incorrect. I've ordered on Uber Eats twice in the last month and both poke bowls were wrong. Both times I went to the restaurant after I ordered through delivery to get it fixed (which obviously defeats the purpose) and the lady at the front said that she packed it herself and that everything was correct. It was missing 3 items in my poke bowl. I ordered pick up today and on the app, it stated that my order was ready. I show up and they tell me that the order was never received. I will say that the guy managing the front door was doing an excellent job and I felt bad that he needed to run after additional items so many times. After waiting another 15 minutes, they brought out my order and was missing two items within the bowl. I don't understand how this can happen SO many times. Love the food. Staff needs to proof read."
9/17/2017,2,"Ok, I like the concept well enough that I wish there was one closer to me. But. I walked in on a random night and tried to order. And tried. And tried. Everything I asked about, and that was listed on the menu, they were out of or just didn't carry. Boba for my tea? Out. The flavor of tea? It was listed on the menu but they didn't carry it ""yet"". Out of avocado. Out of edamame. They've been around a long time and the place is often busy, so they must be doing something right. Maybe it was just an off night, but I won't be traveling to get there."
10/15/2017,5,"First time here. Vegans, so we tried to navigate the menu...luckily, Stephanie was a great help!! She told us the best options and gave great suggestions! Clean, fun atmosphere... great food!"
6/9/2018,5,"The only place my friends and I go to eat. Super inexpensive for amazing food, I can't recommend this place enough.Also, Danie is incredible! He's super friendly and makes eating at bento 5x better."
12/1/2017,1,"So I'm a little peeved. I called them to put in a lunch order for pickup. I called, no answer after 20 rings I hung up. Called back, figured they were busy being it was 1230 lunch time. Again, rings like 10x, then someone picked up and hung up. I called back again, no answer."
1/17/2017,3,"If you are looking for an Asian restaurant with a fast food concept. Bento Cafe is the place to be. It is kind of like a Pei Wei. You order your food at the counter and the servers will bring the food to your table. The menu is very extensive: sushi, stir fry from the wok, rice bowls noodle soups, even boba tea and much more! You can also create your own poke bowl or sushi rolls. I would not say Bento Cafe is an authentic Asian restaurant, but the quality is decent and I am sure anyone can find something they like on the menu!  Price is very affordable and service is fast and friendly! Definitely a great lunch spot for the college students around the area!"
11/20/2017,4,"So good - lots of choices. Not the best quality sushi you'll ever have, but gets the job done. The bowls are awesome, and I like how you can kind of make your own and mix and match!"
11/18/2017,4,Its pretty much the only decent place to get a teriyaki rice bowl around me... which means it's great in my book!
7/28/2017,4,"I love going to bento and I go often, their taro frozen smoothie is delicious, and I love getting their Pokè bowls, stir fry, and rolls. I like how it isn't a full sit down restaurant, but isn't fast food so to say. I like the location, it's 10 minutes away from me and I never hear bad things about this place. Only thing I do have to say though, last time I went, their wahoo and tuna tasted not too fresh. But they accommodated me and made me a new one, along with a free tea the next time I come."
5/21/2017,5,"I love bento so much that every trip to Gainesville was never complete without bento so having a bento close by is a dream come true. Quick, yummy, and great quality. There are so many choices for meat lovers and vegetarians. My favorite is the yellow curry tofu. It's not too heavy like most Thai places. They have a tons of bubble tea flavors as well. Not to mention it's extremely fair priced for the portions they offer. So many ways to get your food: over noodles, bento box (my fav), rice bowl etc. Its hard to find a place that serves vegetarian options in so many ways, so thank you bento! Place gets packed but don't let the line scare you, they are awesome  with getting your order down quick so the line goes down fast! I have so much love for bento that it's difficult to limit it to a yelp review haha. Hands down the best fast food type Asian fusion around (im sorry pei wei, someone else from the neighborhood now has my heart) Skip your local Chinese delivery and give bento a try, I promise you won't regret it!"
4/23/2017,2,"Not impressed Inferior to a Pei Wei. Seems busy, will one day try another entree and give another chance"
6/23/2017,4,Good place. Reasonable prices and good food. Modern decor you get you food fast and I will be back.
12/18/2016,4,"There's no good Asian restaurants here and Bento Cafe fills that void. It has everything-sushi, bubble tea, bento boxes, noodles, rice dishes, etc. It's not really authentic Asian food, but it's good enough for Davie. I prefer the Bento boxes, since I think I get more for the buck. I know people recommend the spicy cream chicken, but it's heavy and deep fried. Beware of dozing off after its consumption. I usually go for the broccoli chicken or garlic soy chicken which has more veggies. I come here every time I crave Asian food."
6/19/2017,3,"Sushi training wheels. That's what I'd call it.  You can pretty much get the same quality sushi at any decent grocery store these days. It wasn't bad but nothing was that good. I had a sushi box combination and if I closed my eyes and tried each piece I wouldn't be able to tell the difference out of three different roles.  The fried dumplings were OK with mediocre sauce. The cucumber and fake crab garnish salad shouldn't even be served because it had absolutely no flavor, if they would've marinated the cucumber in rice vinegar it would've been great.   Looking at the staff working there it's all a bunch of young kids, but the Decour is beautiful. I'd rather spend a dollar more per roll and get super high-quality sushi somewhere else."
10/30/2017,4,After reading the awesome reviews I had to try their bubble tea! I went in around 1pm on a Monday and the line was pretty short. I got a steak bowl with fried rice and sweet chili sauce on the side. I had to get a bubble tea so I tried the green tea passion fruit with boba. The steak bowl was pretty good and the veggies were really fressshhhh. My bubble tea was pretty good and definitely waited less than 5 mins. I will definitely go back!
9/4/2017,5,POKE BOWL!!  My favorite item on their menu.  So many choices....I suggest going through the menu before you head over there due to the amount of choices you have.  Sushi quality is way better than Shinju.  Their hot meals are full of flavor and it's a cool spot to enjoy your meal there. Great customer service!  Overall a great way to enjoy your favorite Asian flavors that won't hurt the wallet.  Buen provecho!
4/13/2017,5,Love this place.  It is located in the Tower Shops in Davie not in Plantation as someone else stated.  Traffic can be crazy in the area and parking is ok.  It does get very crowded at meal times and you may have to wait a bit it you are behind a person who has never been there and doesn't know how it works.  You order your food and then it is brought to your table.  You can order off of the menu and get sushi or cooked asian dishes.  You can also put together your own dish by choosing from different categories and lists on the menu.  The selection is quite large and portion are adequate.  It is usually chilly inside.  There is also a bit of outdoor seating.
4/26/2018,5,My favorite restaurant in Davie! If I had the money I would go here every day. Super helpful staff and fresh food.
3/10/2017,5,"Better than Pei Wei with many options to choose from and delicious at that. If you ever want to get some good food in a rush, I would definitely say Bento is an amazing choice to choose from. * their noodles are delicious."
3/29/2017,4,Good food nice portions decent prices. I had a noodle bowl with chicken yum. Thai ice tea was good too. Parking was not too bad. Casual atmosphere nice place to have a quick fresh lunch. Next  time I am going to try a Poke bowl.Went back and had a tuna Poke bowl. Nice portions very good will be back.
12/2/2016,3,"I had the build a poke-bowl with brown rice, shrimp tempura, carrots, asparagus, scallions, and crushed peanuts. The meal was tasty, although nothing stood out in particular. The portion size was generous for the price. The decor of the restaurant was nice, and the space was clean. I may come back here again."
12/29/2017,5,"Amazing noodles! I love this place. It has a good vibe. The only thing is the menu is a bit confusing, other than that it's delicious."
6/6/2017,4,"So I had a poke bowl with Tuna, and a bamboo roll, both were really good! The tuna could have been a little more fresh, which is why I am not giving it 5 stars. My fiance had the bulgolgi which he didn't like much, he said it was too spicy, I also felt that way about my poke bowl, but that could have been because I put a little too much spicy mayo."
9/28/2016,4,"I came to Bento on two different occasions, once when they just opened and then a few weeks after the grand opening. If you come at a busy time (ex: lunch) be prepared to wait in line. I ordered the create your own poke bowl and it was absolutely amazing!! I also got a thai iced tea with tapioca which was good. The second time I wanted to try something different so I ordered an item from the wok, ""spicy cream"" with shrimp and udon noodles. The noodles were a bit too thick for my liking and I emphasized on my dish being EXTRA spicy. When I received my order, it wasn't spicy at all which was a bummer. I tried a lychee green tea with tapioca which was yummy.  I don't think I'm going to order from the wok again (or atleast the spicy cream) but I'll definitely be coming back for the sushi or poke bowl!! Also, this place is super clean!"
11/1/2016,4,"This place is going to take a lot of my money. Been anticipating its arrival to Tower Shops for a while. Brings back a lot of memories from the original Bento I visited frequently in college. My favorite dish in college from Bento was the spicy salmon don so I had to get that during the first visit. I came to the conclusion as to why I love Bento so much. They have the best spicy mayo. Perfect amount of kick for me. The lines were long during the first few weeks, but moving pretty quickly now. Phones are also working now too for pick up orders. Walk straight to the third register. They now have a make your own poke bowl option where you can select your base, protein, four additions and sauces. I have been getting that since after the first visit. Its like adding a slight twist to my usual salmon don with additions such as mango and  asparagus, yet still get to choose wakame, masago and avocado. For me, one of the biggest appeals is the convenience factor for the variety of Asian food they serve. Its a good place to grab a casual lunch or when you don't feel like cooking dinner, but want to pick up something fast and decent."
6/20/2017,4,"Was so excited when I heard this place was coming to town! The first few weeks of the soft opening we were in there multiple times. So many choices, and I've yet to be disappointed in a meal. I think right now my favorite is the red curry chicken.  I've branched away from in a few times, but I keep going back to it. I get a boba tea to accompany my meal every time, cause how can I go there and not?!"
10/24/2016,5,"Since this place has opened,  I have eaten here 5 times. Everything I have had was delicious.  Sushi is amazing as well as bento boxes and noodle bowls. My favorite is red curry katsu chicken (extra spicy) and spicy cream chicken. the Mongolian steak is also really great!"
7/14/2017,5,"Favorite local Asian food! Whether we place an order to go or dine in, the food is great and the service is fast. My favorite is the sesame chicken bowl with rice. Sometimes there's a long line to place your order, but moves at a great speed."
5/17/2018,5,I came here too Eat with two of my friends yesterday we had the bento Fried rice it was so yummy also the server was so kind she had a sweet little voice and a welcoming smile her name was Ashley she sounded a little nervous she was not in the uniform as everyone else so I'm assuming she's training but she was awesome she checked on our table not once but twice removed dirty dishes we even left her a tip for how well she treated us we'll definitely be back for the good food and service
4/14/2017,5,"Excellent ! We just tried this restaurant for first time and it was great. The kids meals are so good, sushi rolls very good, everything we got was tasty and fresh. Hope they open more locations in broward county. Will def come back again"
5/13/2018,1,I had the stir fry chicken and lo mein bowl tonight and while eating my food I discovered a hair in my mouth!!! I wish I would've taken a picture but I was so disgusted and took the food back right away. I got a refund of course but that doesn't fix the fact of me having a hair in my damn mouth that is SOOOOO DISGUSTING and very UNSANITARY!! I won't ever eat from the place again. I don't even have a damn appetite anymore.
8/21/2017,4,This place is pretty good. I like it way better than pei wei. My first time here I got the bento box and it was pretty good for the price.
11/6/2017,5,"Everything is amazing. Food is fast, fresh and, delicious. I could eat there everyday and find something new. The boba drinks are awesome too."
2/13/2018,5,"Delicious, delicious asian fast-food type of spot.  My favorite place to stop and eat at when shopping in the area. Fast service."
6/16/2017,5,Love this place!!! They beat Pei Wei any day!! And the Milk Teas with pearls are a plus!!!
1/1/2017,4,The food is excellent...sushi was fresh and rolls were the perfect size! There is something for everyone on the menu. The only reason I'm giving a 4 star is because the service was a little slow.
10/12/2017,5,"This place is a step up from Pei Wei with a similar concept. Their food selections are much broader and 100x better than Pie Wei. I had the chicken fried rice and Mexican roll which were scrumptious. The food was fresh, good and plentiful."
4/13/2017,5,"LOVE Bento! The lunch wait time to order was not bad on a Friday afternoon and I probably waited 5-10 minutes for my food to be cooked. Reminded me of Pei Wei but much better! The portion sizes are large and I put half of the big bowl of fried rice in a to-go box before digging in! Also, the Thai Fried Rice was delicious!! Only disappointment was that they did not have Red Chili Flakes!"
5/14/2017,5,The food was delicious..... I was a wee bit overwhelmed with all the options but it's a good overwhelmed! They work like a well oiled machine from the time I ordered and received my food it was probably 5 minutes.
10/16/2016,1,"I love, love, love the Bento in Orlando as well as Gainesville but this one needs to step it up. The dumplings were way, over fried, the edamame wasn't steamed enough, they told me 45 minutes to make ONE sushi roll and that they were still training a month into them being open. I'll try it again in like 3 months but as of right now... It was pretty gro"
9/28/2016,1,This is a great spot. I used to love coming to bento. I ate the tuna don two nights ago and now I have E. coli. Be careful what you eat.
7/1/2017,5,"I fell in love with this place. The location is very good, the food was very fresh and tasty! I will be there soon again"
9/19/2016,5,"Being a vegetarian it's often difficult to find a quality meal but this restaurant caters to all types of foodies, but that isn't the reason it deserves 5 stars. I just ate at a different location and ordered the same meal I had ordered last time, but it didn't taste quite the same. Fernando (an awesome employee that deserves a raise) made an awkward situation nothing but natural and replaced my food with something else I liked. I ordered the 4 piece veggie sushi roll and instead of bringing me 4 he brought me 8! I'm a happy and full customer and will definitely be returning :)"
12/30/2017,2,This is probably my 10th time going to Bento's.  This unfortunately will be my last time going. We ordered a Bento bowl and a sushi roll with two appetizers and all of it was very underwhelming. The broccoli wasn't cooked enough and the steak and shrimp tasted lousy. My wife and I were very disappointed at the quality of the food. I would suggest you find a new Asian bistro place to go to.
12/28/2017,5,The food was great and service was even better. My boyfriend is a vegan- he had a long day at work and didn't realize he ordered something with eggs. We told a server walking around who then asked his manager if I could be remade for us and they did it with no hassle and I got my food the first 5mins sitting down. I really enjoying my experience and even though it isn't over I had to hop on here and share it so far
3/21/2017,5,"Where do I begin! Amazing poke bowls with lots of raw delicious fish! Great sauces, amazing quality toppings! Great sushi, nice staff and awesome service. Do it."
3/18/2017,5,Very impressed with this place! Finally some great eateries coming to the area. Not sure about MSG ect but food tasted FRESH.
6/1/2017,5,"This place is great! Sushi, Asian fusion and Bubble Teas! Cheap for people on a budget. The portions are enough to save half for the next day too!"
4/2/2017,3,"The food is average, but it is fast!  So, it is convenient when you don't time much time but want to eat a quick bite.  I love boba tea - but, don't like theirs.  It is not expensive, but is not cheap for what you get, either."
9/17/2016,5,"Omg where to start! Such a nice staff, very efficient..the food was delicious and for the price point it's unbelievable...if you want quick and tasty without all the hassle please go now!!!"
12/21/2016,2,"Place needs to work on the over the phone order process. I tried 3 times on a Thursday around 8pm to place a call for pick up & was put on hold all 3 times without even a simple hello, how can i help you? Not to mention i was put on hold for 30 minutes each time. I understand the place can get busy, but the same attentiveness that is put into those who go to the location should be put into those who order over the phone.. if not then no point in having that feature available. Ended up having to go to the location, waiting in a really long line behind a family who didn't know what they wanted to wait even longer to get my food."
3/19/2017,5,This place was great! Ordered the poke bowl and it was great. Everything was fresh and the portions were a very good size. Will definitely come back.
7/30/2017,5,The food is always good and it's ready very fast. They don't offer student discounts.
7/30/2017,5,Delicious peanut sauce noodle. It's perfect for dinner if you are looking for something quick.
11/10/2017,5,Hands down one of my favorite places!!! Their poke bowls are amazing. The staff is extremely nice and always brings out your order within minutes of ordering. Decent price too :) definitely recommend
10/8/2016,5,Been here a bunch of times and they never disappoint! Their food is always fresh and fantastic! When you need a sushi fix this is the perfect spot. Excellent customer service and atmosphere as well. Perfect for a nice lunch and then some shopping in the plaza afterwards. My new to-go spot for sushi and Asian Fusion. We're blessed to have Bento in our neighborhood!!!
2/26/2017,5,Best Boba in South FL! Very fresh food love the Taro Milk tea! I wish they had more locations in South FL
12/30/2016,5,"One of my family's new favorite restaurants. Price is very fair and Sushi is delicious. Even my eight-year-old loves the chicken breast. Been there many times and the sushi always seemed very fresh, which is important. It is always super clean and the many staff they have there always seems very courteous. We don't eat shellfish so they even have a special menu to say exactly what you should stay away from. The seating space is very nice and the layout is fantastic. Very nice looking for some what fast food. This is the future of restaurants, folks!"
7/6/2017,4,"Awesome place to go for a variety of Asian food. Restaurant has a nice cool vibe and everyone that works there is super nice and always wants to make sure you're doing fine. Food is good but nothing out of this world. I've tried an array of their sushi rolls as well as their lo mein bowls and everything is good. Again, not amazing out of this world food but still good!"
6/30/2017,4,"Parking could be a problem and going during lunch hour as well due to long lines. Besides that, I enjoyed their Bento box with chicken, lo mein, two type of salads, string beans and rice. Nice ambiance and reasonable prices. I will be back to try their sushi!"
4/10/2017,4,"Great place to go for Lunch or Dinner. The food came very quickly, but the server wasn't sure which dish was which. Probably a new hire, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The tea was great, however they had no Boba the night I went, and they replaced it with a Lychee jelly which, for me, altered the taste of my Thai tea. However, it enhanced the flavor of my sister's Matcha tea. The food was plated adorably! I absolutely loved the Japanese style plates, with everything sectioned off. It was also portioned very well; I finished my plate feeling satiated. The food was also quite delicious! I'd normally say no to rice or string beans, but I cleaned my plate off completely. The sauce (I got the Garlic Soy) was very flavorful and complimented the rest of the dish. The noodles were so tasty that I could eat them by itself. The atmosphere was friendly as well, and the decor was nice too. However, it was a bit cold inside. Altogether, I would definitely go again, and I plan on doing so!"
5/17/2019,4,"The food is delicious. I'm just not so crazy that the poke bowls always seem to come out much much much later than the hot food. By the time the poke bowls come out everyone who had hot food already finished eating. Other than that, like I said, the food is delicious."
4/6/2017,4,"Always buzzing w customers. Wish the online order system was up and running, that would save a lot of time seeing that the restaurant is located in the middle of Nova,FAU & Broward College. Aside from that the food is worth any wait time you may encounter."
5/13/2019,4,"So the first thing you think is oh no another fast food Asian place, but that is hardly the case! I love this place! Everything is always fresh and nicely presented and being able to completely customize your poke bowl or bento box is really cool.I eat here frequently and I am never disappointed."
3/18/2019,5,"My favorite place for poke bowls. The fish is always fresh, portions of protein are decent, good selection of additions and sauces. It gets crowded, so I mostly call in for takeout and it's very quick and convenient."
3/23/2017,5,"Where do I start with Bento. I eat here at least once a week and not once have I ever been disappointed. The food is great. Everything I've had from the red curry, asian cajun, spicy cream, bulgogi, etc etc has been on point. Even their sushi is great. The selection is massive. I think all of that plus the fact that all of the meals usually are under $10:00 is great. Customer service is great too, every time I've ordered take out its always in order and they never miss anything. Kudos for that. I wish they had a location in Miami. But since I am in plantation for work 5 days a week, its not too bad. ha"
6/8/2017,5,Fantastic food!  Fabulous staff!  But yeah... either call ahead or come at off peak times.  Food is fresh and delicious - there's so much to choose from so everybody is always happy.  Dine in or take out - this food is worth the trip!
1/21/2017,5,"I cannot get enough! My favorite sushi place around. I usually order the Japanese bagel which is made with smoked salmon. Very tasty and alot better than the fried options. I also have tried their. Mexican roll which is made with cooked shrimp aswell. My boyfriend usually gets the chicken roll and has tried different bento boxes and bowls. We try to order for take out because the line gets too long sometimes. But if you dont mind waiting, it worth the wait:)"
3/13/2017,5,Best place ever!! I'm obsessed I eat there everyday so far! The quality of the food is amazing and they get it to you so quick !
1/26/2019,4,"Bento is great! I love their Poke Bowls and they have a lot of good options. However, I am taking off one star because there have been a few times where some of the items I want for my poke bowl are not available (one time they didn't have salmon, another time they didn't have avocado, etc.). Besides this they have great customer service and I love that you can order over the phone and go straight to a separate line and pick it up!"
4/24/2019,5,I love going to Bento they are very decently priced and the food quality is great. I love that I can call in my order and pick it up. I just wished I could get it delivered because the drive from the office during lunch time is horrible and I only have a certain amount of time. But overall they are amazing!
8/21/2017,5,"favorite sushi place for now on, good quality food, tasty and good price. great place to chill"
11/9/2016,3,My husband and I went for the first time on a Thursday night around 7:30 pm. The line felt like it did not move! we waited about 20-25 minutes in line. The sushi was pretty good but my husband's dish (siracha sauce chicken and noodles) didn't taste fresh.
10/21/2017,5,"This place is fantastic for what it is. It is not the pinnacle of sushi or Thai food, but for a quick meal you cannot beat it for the quality or the price. I get to build your own poke bowl regularly and it is not only a good deal, but it tastes great. I highly recommend this place."
10/16/2017,4,"Nice place with great options of building your own sushi bowl. Portions were large; the bento boxes are humongous and my poké bowl was very filling. Their boba teas were also quite delicious! All of the fish tasted fresh and despite a long line when we entered, we were ordering in under five minutes and served in under 10."
1/22/2017,5,They have a good variety decent pricing. And sushi is good. Boba mil teas are really nice too. Definitely coming back for more
1/4/2019,5,"Always great service (in person & call ins), quick to get my food after ordering, and have never had any problems with my food... actually the complete opposite. I love the menu and the quality of food! Bento is my favorite place for sure."
10/13/2016,5,"The spicy cream chicken was amazing...I liked the light batter on the chicken with the creamy texture of the sauce. Food took a little while to come out and the line was long, but the food tasted great to me and the establishment was clean! Will be repeating here frequently."
7/11/2017,4,"For what it is --it is very good. Exceptionally large menu of sushi, sushi bowls, noodle and the usual Asian fare.  The place where it shines in the price. Not expensive for the quality or quantity.This is what Pie Wie should have been!However, bring a jacket as the place is always kept at a winterizing temperature."
1/6/2017,5,"Fantastic food, great atmosphere. I ordered the chicken Pad Tai and was very pleased. The serving sizes are generous, I got it to-go and i had it for lunch over 2 days (I am small). Very clean bathrooms and soda fountain area."
3/23/2017,5,"Best poke bowls! & Ive never seen this place without a line, would definitely recommend."
7/5/2017,5,This is probably one of my favorite sushi places in Davie! I'm a student at Nova and eat here at least once a week. Everything from the rolls to the poke bowls to the fried rice is delicious. If you aren't wanting sushi I would highly recommend the pineapple fried rice. It's to die for! The spicy Don bowl is also out of this world and about 3 times the food for the same price as one sushi roll. Highly recommend!
11/4/2016,5,Awesome place with so many choices. Randomly came here after class and loooveed the bento box. Definitely coming back!
11/1/2016,5,I almost cried when I saw that there was a Bentos in S. Flo. The spicy tuna don is out of this world! The curry chicken bento box was so dank too. It was my cousins first time and she loved it. I do not mind the 30 minute drive and all that traffic around that area just to get me some spicy tuna don:). I will be taking my fiance this weekend since he is coming home from over seas(he's very excited). Prices are fair and portions are huge.
10/29/2016,1,"Sitting here in this new place so shocked at treatment . I did a ""create your own poke bowl"" when I asked for 1/2 rice 1/2 lettuce they informed me that cannot be done? Really you can't take some lettuce and some rice and shove it in a bowl? I asked a manager what the problem was and she informed me as well that it is absolutely impossible to take some rice and some lettuce and put it in a bowl, she also informed me that most places don't have a create your own poke bowl and basically I should be thankful that they even have a create your own poke. So I asked for a side of plain lettuce on the side since it's such an impossible task for the people who work here to do . Upon receiving my bowl I noticed it was 95% rice 2.5 % toppings and 2.5% eel. Ansolutly astonished at the service I was given by the girl at the counter , the mananger and the appearance of this so called ""poke bowl "" don't come here don't give this place and their nasty employees a dime . Was so excited to try this place and so beyond disappointed"
12/20/2016,4,This place reminds me of Pei Wei but with better options. Both times I've gone I've had the bento box which has pretty good portions. The sushi here is not for the person who likes authentic sushi not bad but more main stream. Service is good as well but you can tell who likes their job and who's there collecting their check. Over all a great place to check out!
8/3/2018,2,I'm not sure if it's the over priced menu or the questionable quality but this place just dosnt sit well with my stomach or wallet. Maybe it was cause I tried it early on when it first opened. I just gotta go back and give it another try I guess.
12/12/2016,5,Love this placeeeeee it's quick and easy Asian food college friendly good prices similar to mr robotos good for when you want some sushi but don't wanna sit somewhere super fancy their bento boxes are awesome
2/28/2017,5,"All the employees here are very nice and attentive, food quality always the best and quick service too"
9/15/2016,5,I'm so happy to have this place near my office. We tried it today and everyone loved it! Will definitely coming back for more.
6/11/2017,2,I ordered here for the first time and I will not be going back. I ordered the beef bulgogi and not only was t cooked way to fast but it did not taste right. The beef did it taste good and there was barely any sauce on it. I was extremely disappointed. I will not order from here again.
6/10/2017,5,Nice place for lunch or light dinner.  Meat is well seasoned and sushi is quite decent.
1/20/2019,5,Build your own poke is great!!!  Szechuan beef noodle soup is delish!!   Really enjoy their food!!   My go to poke place!!
2/15/2017,5,"I've been to Bento various times and have never walked out disappointed. I was very excited to try this location having only been to the one in Tallahassee. The staff is very friendly and very helpful and the food is delicious and fresh the location is also very clean. I always get the sushi combo box which has the California roll ( I add cream cheese), special Mexican and Mt. Fuji. My boyfriend has tried their Pad Tai and fried rice and has really liked both. I recommend this place to everyone!"
9/29/2016,2,If you want to stand up for an hour before you even order it's pretty good. Other than that the service once you order is pretty quick. The food is good and well priced. I still kinda think of it as a worse pie wei.
1/3/2019,5,"This is one of my favorite places to eat, love everything about it. You can not go wrong with anything off the menu and I'm addicted to the boba tea."
10/26/2016,2,"The food it self is good but the service...it's soooo slow.  Even when it's a pick-up order. I called in a order and was told that it would be ready in 15 mins. once I arrived, I had to wait almost 20 mins to get my food. If it wasn't because I was told "" 5 more minutes"" or ""they are almost done making it"" I would of left. Too bad I won't be going back."
10/21/2018,5,"I can eat here again and again! Good amount of items on the menu and plenty of space in the dining area. Prices are very good, particularly the sushi combo and the sushi is very good. My son had a kids meal, teriyaki chicken and noodles. It came in a cute bento box and there was a ton of food for a kids meal. Can't wait to go back!"
10/17/2016,5,"heard very good things, decided to check it out. once you walk in there are the menus then you walk up to the cashier and place your order then they bring it to you.. VERY FAST! my food came out so fast i thought it would be cold or not good but it was sooo good and hot! the staff was friendly. everything is basically self serve. they have the soda machine with over 100 sodas, the forks, chopsticks, napkins, to go box were all there. there is also boba tea there that's interesting. so many different options as well. i would deff come back and recommend"
10/15/2016,5,Love this place. Food comes out so fast. Love the poke bowls the most. The bento box is pretty redic too! Yum yum yum.
10/11/2016,4,As my poke mission continues... kobachi sauce here rocks. Sushi will apparently NEVER be as fresh and melt in your mouth as in HI. They need to add more veg to bowl and fish is not abundant either but will do. Also if all these poke shops are gonna start popping up can somebody please add furikake to their recipe!!!
4/14/2017,5,"I remember how awesome this place was back when I was in college. So when I found out they had one in Davie, I had to try it out. The ambiance is really nice and laid back. The cashier was very nice and offered a complimentary water cup while I waited for my to go food. The food was just how I remembered. The spicy cream chicken was excellent.  I got the Mexican roll also and that was good too. It was very nostalgic being in this place as it reminded me of my college years ."
10/4/2016,4,So glad to have this place in soflo! The choices are awesome and the quantity is big for the price you pay.  Tried their milk teas twice...very disappointed but other than that a great place for food.
8/9/2018,1,So disappointed to discover they use MSG in most everything. Discovered this after eating. Then had to deal with MSG symptoms. Why use it? Most restaurants stopped years ago. Won't return as long as they continue using MSG.
10/1/2016,5,"YESSSSS!!!! My favorite restaurant from Orlando has finally come right across the street from me!!! Just opened and already super busy. Waited as while in line but once we ordered food came out pretty quickly from kitchen and sushi bar. Place looks great. Must have the chicken yellow Thai curry bento box and tuna salmon don bowl. And don't forget the best part..... BOBA TEA!!!! Lychee milk tea my favorite!!! Excellent food and excellent prices, I'm gonna spend a lot of money here!!!"
10/1/2016,4,First time here.  Food is delicious. Service was good. Took a long time to order. Long line on Saturday at 1330 hrs. Still very enjoyable.
3/18/2017,5,This place is delicious and the price is reasonable... the spicy tuna and salmon don is to die for.
11/23/2016,5,"I figured the food would be good but I was very surprised to find the food was AMAZING!!! I've paid a lot more for sushi and still not gotten this quality. I cannot wait to come back for more! Try the poke bowls, they were generous and yummy!"
11/9/2016,2,"Skip the green tea it has so much sweetener in it that it defeats the purpose of ordering green tea.  Then they bring the wrong bowl out and they bring the main course before the appetizer....really disorganized.....sushi is on par with what you get at Publix, nothing special.  Recommend just skipping this place. Better to just go to your neighborhood sushi place and have a respectable sit down meal."
1/13/2019,2,"I'm so sad to leave a bad review since this had been one of my favorite places to eat.  It used to be worth the hassle of traffic on University and the lack of parking but now that my last three trips here have resulted in less than stellar experiences I shall be discontinuing my patronage.  The 1st strike was when I placed a to go order.  I picked up the bag and drove all the way home only to find the order incomplete.  The 2nd strike, several weeks later, was when I arrived to find no sushi on the menu.  The 3rd and final strike was no salmon on the menu.  Each time it's an effort to get to the shopping center and an effort to find parking and when three consecutive trips yield less than pleasant experiences I have to draw the line.  Sorry, Bento.  It was good until it wasn't."
7/18/2018,4,I've been here a few times and it's always very busy. I usually let my daughter ior grandson order while I grab a table. It's a bit noisy at lunchtime. The food is so good it's always a delight to go there for lunch.
7/15/2018,4,Been here twice good food. Very quick. Get your own drink and silverware (plastic) service is lighting quick and polite.
12/30/2018,5,I come here every other week to get dose of poke and most of the time its good sometimes they have little mistakes here and there but staff is super cool and always fix it right away.
9/19/2016,5,"I first found out about Bento in Orlando, and loved it so when this location opened it was a must try! To start, the restaurant is clean and the staff is attentive and helpful in terms of answering questions related to the menu. I didn't think it was possible to love Bento more than I already did. I recommend the create your own poke bowl (see pictures). The  food is delicious, I am definitely coming back!"
12/5/2016,5,"I love! So fresh and so filling! But yet so healthy, I get the spicy salmon tuna don bowl with brown rice!"
10/30/2016,5,This is my new favorite place to eat any day of the week! I haven't had one thing I did not like. The TNT roll is my favorite sushi roll but you can never go wrong with a poke bowl! Their pork dumplings and spring rolls are good too!
7/16/2018,5,"I love this place. The sushi is awesome, the service is great, and the people are nice."
10/21/2016,3,"I've been there twice. The first time was so full, every table. The food and service was awesome. The second time, the place was empty, the service and food sucked. I asked for a highchair, was told ok. She never brought it. Asked for the manager, was told ok, then ignored again. The manager finally came after having to go to the counter to get him. He apologized and said he would remake the food, after 20 minutes, he brought part of it, and by then the kids had had enough, he packed it to go. I wasn't hungry from waiting so long and brought it home. When we opened it to eat, just like the one there, it wasn't close to as good as the first time, I forgot to say, same food was ordered, and some of the tuna was inedible."
10/7/2017,2,"Disappointed, food was worse than wal mart deli service was slow. My order sat ready for 5 minutes before they gave it to me"
10/6/2018,4,"Love food, menu, atmosphere, great place to eat but try to avoid peak hours the lines get long"
9/25/2016,1,"Second time I have walked out disappointed. First time, I wanted just a tea and the girl would not let me place the order where take out orders are placed. She wanted me to wait 30 minutes just to get one tea. I am writing this review outside their restaurant as I walked out for the second time. The girl could not explain herself but what we understood was that the kitchen was backed up and that our meals would take 30 minutes to come out after we've waited the 30 minute line. She basically told us to leave as the party in front of us would be the last ones to order. Terrible service. I have tried their food before and it's nothing to wait in line for. Never again."
9/19/2016,1,Blah.  Terrible food. It took 20 minutes to get 2 rolls out and they brought my hot entree out 15 minutes before my daughters sushi! The cooks weren't even authentic sushiSo disappointed
9/19/2016,1,"The food is less than average !! Nothing special unless you are a real blue collar eater. It is rather inexpensive , but you get what you pay for .The place is nicely decorated and service is fast.The 90% of the dish us just rice rice rice, with some topping . Ridiculous. Every Sushi of higher quality serves much better dishes. If you are a large family and need to stuff your dear ones cheap , then , go there.This place is not recommended for people with better palatable taste."
11/29/2016,5,This place is Amazing! Blows away pei way and many other oriental restaurants. Staff was very nice also but the food was 10/10. Definitely will be returning.
8/13/2018,5,"Amazing Asian food here. I've tried a couple of different bowls and also their pad Thai and they are excellent. Food is always fresh, hot, and fast. I visit this place at least once a week for lunch. Haven't tried this sushi yet but heard that it is very good."
4/20/2018,5,"I love it here. My husband and I go all the time. It can be difficult to find options for eating out since I'm a vegetarian and my husband is not but Bentos has a great selection so that we can both be happy. I particular love their spicy avocado rolls and always get a bubble tea (passion fruit or taro). Although the lines can get long depending on the time, they take orders quickly and so you don't have to wait too long. The food also gets there in good time. Highly recommend for casual dining."
7/29/2017,1,This was recommended to me by a coworker when I mentioned how I love Boba/Bubble Tea. Since I was in the area running errands I stopped in for lunch. The line was all the way to the door so I thought that must be a good sign. I ordered the Thai pineapple fried rice bowl and a large Boba Tea. It cost me $14 but I thought I would wait and see how the food was before judging the prices. The tea was not bad but the size of the cup wasn't really what I would consider a large. I thought the price was excessive for green tea with a little flavoring added in. The server then came and told me that unfortunately they had no pineapple to make my dish. She asked if I wanted something else or to try it without the pineapple. I didn't feel like looking through the menu again so I just told her to make it without. She came back a minute later and said they also didn't have the sauce so they couldn't make the dish at all. She asked if I wanted to order something else. At this point I was very hungry and getting frustrated so I asked for a refund on the entree. She apologized and said she promised next time they wouldn't have the same issue. The experience and the prices turned me off from ever wanting to return again so I will find someplace else that offers Boba Tea in Broward.
5/13/2018,5,"I love this place especially the Pineapple Thai fried rice , the flavor is so rich and the spicy cream chicken with lomein . ALL TIME FAVORITE FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.!!!"
4/28/2018,1,I first want to say the food is awesome however I have a severe allergy to pineapples and they don't have a separate blender for people who suffer from allergies. The lady that rung me up was awesome but she asked her manager about allergie and the manager looked like she didnt care at all. Very poor management here.  Very upset customer today and I am a regular here .
10/24/2017,5,Never let down with bento! Quality and affordable food. Can't wait for the pines location to open up!
3/23/2017,5,"Was visiting family and made a stop by this place on our way to the beach.  Didn't expect much other than a quick boba tea, but  I have to say our server Ben made the stop worth it.  If you go, I'd recommend the crunch roll!"
1/23/2017,1,"Great setting and vibes from the employees! However, I ate the Rainbow roll and pork dumplings and ended up feeling nauseaous with the worst stomach ache. Turns out I had food poisoning!? The QUALITY of the sushi needs to get better!"
1/25/2017,5,I got a Bento Box with Mongolian Beef and a Red Dragon Roll and I shared both with my mom for lunch and it was more than enough and both were delicious! I loved all the little goodies in the Bento Box!
11/7/2016,5,I love this place! My fellow yelper introduced me to this place. Amazing!!!!! I wish I had one closer to my house : )Try the Mango BOBA blended ice drink it's good!
2/28/2018,5,"Love this restaurant, and it's right next to my other favorite restaurant. My only gripe is that it's always busy, but I can't really fault everyone for wanting to go there."
1/28/2017,1,"Want a meal covered in grease?! Then this is the spot for you!! Honestly they do have some pretty big portions but the food is very average. I could have got the same thing at another Asian joint for less. My husband and I were not impressed and ended up leaving more than half our food at the table. Wasn't worth the wait, or the money in my opinion."
4/18/2018,5,"Great food, reasonably priced. Servers were all very friendly. I liked that each type of meal had several options."
3/28/2018,1,never going here again!  Second time I find a piece of hair in my soup. The replacement meal had a piece of plastic.
10/16/2016,3,"The food is good but we found out they use msg. I wish they were more open about it. No where on their website does it say anything about msg. Finally I just called and sure enough, the lady said ""some of our dishes contain msg."" It's so sad because the noodles I had were pretty good. I won't be back...."
12/3/2017,2,"I don't get it... it's just a Pei Wei with sushi.  The rice box I got wasn't that interesting and the sushi was okay but not great. One thing it was, was very noisy and it was only half full.  To tell you the truth, I'm not going back. I'd rather go to the sushi buffet down the street and get a much bigger selection for just a little more money."
11/18/2017,4,"The food is pretty good, depending on what you order. The poke bowls and sushi are always great, but the rice bowls tend to be a mockup of buffet food. The bubble tea is perfectly made to taste, but the boba is usually a bit hard. We come here fairly often, and would recommend this place for anyone looking for a sushi dinner at a decent price."
11/10/2017,2,The food is ok; good enough. But don't come anywhere near a meal time. You just wait in line. People have no clue what they want and it holds everything up. The cashiers don't know how to answer questions and that makes it slower. If u decide you want anything else... back in line! That's what happened to me. I wanted to add on dumplings to a take out order. Double the wait. No triple; the cashiers stand there and data enter in front of your face. Not a fan.
7/16/2017,4,I go here all the time because my wife love this place. I like it because it is a safe place to have Asian food and sushi. Most Asian food places tend to sketch me out because of less than desirable sanitary conditions. This place is new and clean. Food is good and comes out quick. They have a lot of very fairly priced items on the menu but it is easy to run your bill up. My two personal favorites are the beef bulgogi and special Mexican roll.
1/31/2017,3,"Had such high hopes as I have eaten at the Gainesville location and several times when they opened plantation location.  I went there this week and it was barely acceptable. Rotten lettuce, noodles w no flavor and shrimp dish w 5 shrimp and mostly onions. Really disappointing.  Expect chain Asian food and you get what you pay for."
4/22/2017,5,Awesome concept. Been there numerous times and never had a bad experience. Pretty phenomenal considering how busy this place can get.
12/31/2016,1,"What a HUGE disappointment. Your customer service is disgusting. After ordering and waiting for twenty minutes a server comes and says ""oh did you order the sushi? Well it's going to be a while"" ....so I say ""what is a while? 5 more minutes, 10 minutes"" she looks at me like I'm a complete idiot and says ""like 30 minutes or 45. We are doing a catering order"". At this point I'm waiting for an apology or an offer to give me an alternate meal but nope, nothing. I go to the counter to get my money back and a nice young man asks me if I want to speak to a manger - yes, thank you I do. Bento, what an ineffectual Manager. No apology, no reason, again no offer of another meal, he just stood there. I expressed to him my annoyance in his lack of interest in my experience as a first time customer and again was met with a dry response. Never again. Bento, please train your manager on duty today to deal with customers. Here is what should have been said ""I am so very sorry, there was an issue in the kitchen and we are unable to prepare the meal you ordered. Would you like to see the menu the see if there is anything on the menu you would like to order""..... there you go!"
10/9/2017,4,"Sometimes it is a miss and they run out of ingredients, but every time a better than average tasting food. Overall not bad experience, good to visit now and then."
12/11/2017,5,"This is for the quality of their food and tastiness, but the staff could use some more training or just maybe more supervision.  My best friend and I went as we like to explore new places to eat and we asked for spicy mayo and soy sauce and never got it but the guys next to us got what they asked for almost right away and those guys even went a step further by asking us if we would like their sauce.  Other than that the food was great, hence the 5 stars!"
9/22/2017,5,"This is probably my favorite restaurant right now! it's super chill for like an afternoon little date. The food is AMAZING, everyone who works there is extremely nice! I love it! Would recommend to anyone! Best orange chicken ever over there!!!"
6/2/2017,4,Love the sushi here! Great prices and great menus.  Very casual setting and loved the dessert!!!!
5/30/2017,5,"The creamy chicken is amazing. Absolutely love this place. Sometimes the line is long during rush hours, but the service is great and the food is worth it. Avoid the line by ordering ahead and picking it up. I just wish they had outside seating!"
5/3/2017,3,"Loud and crowded. I don't think I saw a free table when I walked in but thank god I ordered over the phone. I spent $20 on 3 things and the only thing that was good was the California roll. The salad..... cmon guys I know it's ginger salad and a sushi place but dressing flavored like the SUSHI GINGER??? Gross. The girl gave me my bag and the dressing was literally less than half of the soufflé cup... Good thing I checked before walking out or I would have been pissed. I had an udon chicken broccoli bowl the broccoli was dry, my toddler wouldn't even eat it and he loves broccoli. the extra star is because no other sushi place sells Cali rolls already covered in masago! Best part!!i"
8/4/2017,3,14 people on line. ONE register open. Which is typical these days of many restaurants with this format. Service is sloooooooowwwwwwwwww.. Food is Ok but woefully salty.
12/28/2016,1,Who knows how the food is but the service sucks. I have never been to this place before and asked for a menu.  The girl at the register was rude and gave me a smart ass response when I asked. I glanced at the menu was eager to order because of reviews and I was craving sushi. But the more I replayed her rude remark in my head I decided not to spend my money at this establishment. There are other places around here with better service. I'll eat there.
6/28/2017,3,So obviously I was more than frustrated when I posted my last review but I can say that since then we have been back a few times and have even been able to place pick-up orders over the phone.  The last time I was there the cashier wasn't exactly the friendliest but our order was correct and tasty so it didn't really matter. The food is good but for some reason it's not as satisfying as the orlando locations.
6/25/2017,4,It's a fast food place ...casual concept. I ordered food to go. Delicious food!
6/16/2017,4,"Been to the bento cafe twice and both time the food, service and the price has been great. For about $40 you can 3 meals. Which for Asian food is good. Other places charged more. The food is great and a lot of choices. The portion size are good and atmosphere is too. I'm definitely going back."
2/28/2017,4,The food is. It that expensive and you have a wide selection of options when it comes to Asian food. It's a good place to try a little bit of everything all in one place. The poke bowls are great.
8/24/2017,3,Beautiful and clean place with friendly and helpful staff which is why I give it 3 stars but completely underwhelming. Sushi is very low grade and badly made (sushi rice to fish ratio was off). The bento box was unsalted. Rice was hard. I found a hair in my sushi. It was just an average place. Wouldn't frequent.
5/24/2017,2,"Have been here a few times and their Poke bowl selection and Szechuan bowl are pretty good. However, today was a perfect example of how you can ruin a customer relationship with one interaction, i was lectured by the order taker on the proper protocol to order my bowl, problem was she was taking my order on a notepad and therefore it was a moot point not to mention the condescending tone she used..."
12/19/2016,5,"My family loves this place. We try to stay away from chains especially when it comes to sushi. However, the sushi here is better than most sushi places I've eaten at. The bamboo tile is amazingggggg. My family always gets the bowls. By far our favorite is the sirracha garlic bowl! It's got a great spice and very tasty. It's quick easy and decently priced. Highly recommended"
3/2/2017,4,"Japanese food, Thai food. The rolls are good and fairly priced.  The cooked menu items are fair to good.  BUT THEN THERE IS THE WAIT.  This place is usually packed, even during off hours.  I have waited 20+ minutes for a take out order (ordered when I got there).  There's no website to order in advance, but you can call.  In one of the chicken dishes they used dark meat without specifying that on their menu.  I will go back, but probably only for the fairly priced sushi.  They never got an order wrong, but be prepared to wait.  This is not a fast food joint."
2/26/2017,1,We ordered takeout from here. They forgot to include our sauces. The food was good... until we found a hair in our soup. Definitely will be my last time ordering from here
2/17/2017,2,The McDonalds of Chinese food. Much better off finding an authentic hole in the wall. We won't be going back. Should've picked the falafel place.
2/17/2017,4,"The sushi is pretty good, but I'm a big fan of the bowls, in particular the katsu curry."
2/16/2017,4,Decent food and decent prices. I really liked it here and would definitely go again. It's perfect if you're looking for a quick lunch!
10/29/2016,2,"The largest issue for me with this restaurant is it's lack of professionalism. I called in to place an order for pick-up since it's always so busy inside. While I was placing the order the girl who answered, took my order repeated to make sure it was correct then hung up the phone before I could ask how much or how long ? I tried to call back no exaggeration 3 times no one picks up. On the 4th ring someone picks up and before I could complain they put me on hold. It really set the wrong tone for me. I'm honestly not sure if I'd ever come here again."
2/10/2017,4,"Nice food, nice setting. Bring a jacket the place is too cold, every time we go there it's freezing. Obviously good if we go back"
1/11/2017,5,First time going last night. Similar to Pei Wei with more variety and cheaper prices! Excellent food and always fresh! Highly recommend
9/20/2016,5,"Though the line to order was a bit long (only one cashier until I got to the register when a 2nd one opened), it was definitely worth the wait. I tried one of their sushi rolls ( Red dragon) and it was delicious, super fresh! I am definitely going back to try more!"
12/10/2016,5,Food is fresh and reasonably priced. We recently had Zeph(server) help us and he was very friendly and helpful. Easy place to go with or without the kids.
11/16/2016,5,"For the price, the food is great and the quality is there. We've always had good service and enjoyed every dish we tried. You must try Bento if you're looking for a quick, affordable Asian cuisine option for lunch! I should warn you that it can get quite busy, so plan accordingly if you have a limited amount of time for lunch!"
10/30/2016,1,Have been trying to call for pick-up for half an hour and it just rings and then disconnects.
11/14/2016,4,First tried it in Orlando and I'm so happy that there's a location here! I always get a salmon poke bowl or the stir fry tofu udon. Their rolls are great too! Nice dine in atmosphere.
11/18/2017,4,really good food- easy lunches with healthy options- sometimes the person cashing out can be clueless about toppings otherwise recommended
9/1/2022,4,"Four stars for being by far the best Bento restaurant I've been too! I've only been to one and this is the second lol but I loved the decor and layout of the restaurant. I thought it was pretty cool how they have a only hand washing sink next to the soda machine. We came in an hour prior to close so we didn't wait much at all for the food. The cashier was very friendly, patient and attentive! We were a group of five and couple of us had never been here. Even though I praised the inside, we ate outside as the night temperature was welcoming. I ended up cleaning the table myself as it was dirty.The food came out delicious! It was at the right temperature, not piping hot, and I wanna say ""fresh"" but I can tell the noodles were out for awhile BUT nonetheless delicious. The sushi was amazing! Had the TNT which was the best! The rainbow roll was ok, had better. The boba tea is AMAZING here! Wow! Super delicious and exquisite. Definitely get your boba tea fix here. Everyone here was friendly, social and helpful. I asked for a plastic container and the employee told me in very warm and friendly way that the to go boxes can hold liquid and assured me my leftovers will make it home. :) Overall, I had a pretty amazing experience here."
9/3/2022,3,"Nice to find a stir fried noodle dish with lots of veggies and protein, good for the family to share.Service took a bit longer and pricing seemed a little high. But overall, happy to find this place walkable from the Marriott Fort Lauderdale Airport hotel that we were staying at."
8/21/2022,3,"Located in Dania Point, this restaurant is nestled between Lime and In Ramen.  Upon entering, you can pick up a menu at the end of the line so you know what you want by the time it's your turn to order.  I ordered the Szechuan Chicken Bowl with fried rice.  I then took a seat at a table and waited approximately 5 minutes for the food. It arrived piping hot and the portion appeared to be large.  Besides chicken, there was an assortment of vegetables: zucchini, carrots, beans, etc.  The Szechuan flavor was not the greatest. However, the fried rice was amazing! The rice was actually the best part of the dish."
12/17/2022,1,"Food wrong twice for dine in, didn't receive my boba until we were completely finished, they literally gave me just plain salmon over rice and didn't add any sauce or toppings and said that is how the bowl comes lol. So bland and not enough food. Maybe the bento is good but the poke was awful."
7/28/2022,1,"I so very much wanted to love this place. I will give 5 stars to the young lady who rang me up and offered suggestions.5 stars to the warm white rice in the bento box but 1 star for the lukewarm/cold food. The tofu was fried/dried so much that it was edible. This was my first time so I do not know if this is the way that it is served. Total disappointment and waste of money. And it was not cheap either.It was nice that they have a sink for hand washing at the beverage station. I did not write this review right away since I contacted the ""we care share your experience"" website with no response as of today. :-("
3/4/2022,3,"I really want to give this location a great review, unfortunately it just is not consistent enough. When it hits it HITS but when it misses it misses. The Miami role is delicious! Always hits! The other options, order at your own risk. The green beans had little flavor even tho they were covered in garlic. Lo mein also had very little flavor despite having onions and carrots. Would come back only for the sushi"
12/9/2022,4,The BEST customer service and the sweetest staff. The only issue is the boba. The taro and the honey boba is quite literally the worst tasting boba I've ever had. The texture was as if they overcooked the pearls and the taste of the taro was way off. Definitely choose another flavor and don't get the pearls. I also tried the mango tea with lychee jelly it was DELICIOUS!
12/31/2021,4,Stopped in first time for lunch and ordered a bento sushi box with choice of rolls. I designate sushi as this place has both hot and cold boxes. I was very hungry so wanted the variety and quantity of items. This truly delivered very flavorful and fresh. When you go inside you order and they bring your order to your table. For this visit I chose outside since I was in need of fresh air as well as Covid free germs. Also I ordered a bottle of Fuji water which is my favorite. My two choices of rolls were Spicy Tuna and Mt. Fuji they had me at eel sauce made for a beautiful presentation I even had fellow diners ask what was I eating as the Mt. Fuji looks beautiful with the crab on top. Bento box is $15. well worth the price for a delicious lunch.
6/4/2022,5,"If you're in the mood for quick good Asian food, you can never go wrong with bento. The portions are pretty large and actually not that bad for the wallet. Definitely better than a Panda Express or a hole-in-the-wall Asian spot in my opinion. Bobas always taste fresh and delicious"
5/14/2022,3,"Three.5 stars  it's about right for this place it was not so bad... I don't have much to say but a couple of dishes we bought they are okay... Bento Box  it's pretty descent Noodle Bowl  wasn't bad... just lacked a flavor, Pao Pao chicken  2.5 stars"
5/22/2022,3,"I ordered their bento box to include prawns in a yellow curry. The portion is very generous. The salad had a very nice ginger dressing. The noodles were pleasant, the side green beans were also a hit. However, I was very disappointed in the yellow curry sauce, it seemed generic, globby and not particularly authentic in the taste, to be honest. The vegetables also seem to be thrown in from frozen, as they appeared watery. The prawns however were plentiful, large and cooked through. I would come again, but would NOT choose the yellow curry, but would try something else, maybe a stir fry."
3/2/2022,4,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was excited to see the restaurant was booming with business!For starters, the customer service was amazing and majority of the staff working there truly looked like they were enjoying themselves. In my eyes, that means the food is being prepared with attention and care! I came in and the incredible list of flavors and options were slightly intimidating, but with the help of one of the employees, I was recommended the Gochujang Garlic Chicken Bento Box which was super tasty. The Bento Box includes lo mein, your choice of white or brown rice, sautéed garlic green beans, a ginger salad and your choice of entree, mine being the Gochujang Garlic Chicken. The chicken was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy and also a hefty portion and the ginger salad was a mix of cucumber, cherry tomatoes and a proper salad mix with romaine. The other sides were just okay. Along with this, I ordered a Peach Green Boba Tea which was decent, nothing much to rave about and too sweet for my liking. Overall, a decent lunch option!"
5/22/2022,1,The food is to much greasy. Is a fast food asian food and is not cheapThe place was empty the service vas regular but the food is not goof
6/14/2021,3,"This is the 3rd location I've tried, and still... the one in Davie in the plaza with Home Depot near NOVA University is the best location hands down! Reason being... this place was empty, maybe 2 customers dining inside. My party and I sat outside and thete were tables that weren't cleaned or picked up. Ordered crab wontons. I don't think the employee who fried them knows how to drain off excess oil or even fried them at the right temperature because oil should not be pouring out of the wontons (see photos of oil in the plate and on a napkin). The employee at the register didn't know how to answer our menu questions and guessed answers lolI think from now on, I'll just stick to the Davie location."
11/16/2021,3,"Fast food sushi and poke bowls are ok by me.  Ended up eating here twice in a weekend because it was next to my hotel and 1) I love Poke, and 2) I was hungover often... so yeah this place was my cure.Easy ordering system - pay at the counter, you'll get a number and they'll bring it to your table.  And nice staff. I love places that have custom poke bowls, as well as some pre-set options as my mom isn't good at creating her own.  Portion size is pretty good for the price.  One complaint, the ice or drink machine is super loud, and, ok two complaints, I was always freezing inside."
12/11/2021,4,We ordered two orders of sushi and a noodle bowl. The sushi was fantastic!  Spicy tuna and Miami roll we're super delicious and fresh. The tuna was minced and mild tasting. The Miami roll had shrimp on top and crab inside. That roll was outstanding. The noodles were a little bit too saucy but the vegetables and noodles done to perfection. We sat outside on a beautiful night and enjoyed our meal. If I lived here I would definitely come back here.  Patio is spacious and lots of indoor seating. Wonderful menu good for families. Reasonable prices.
5/13/2022,1,"Found a dead bug in my poke bowl today. Didn't even receive a sorry when I called to let them know. Unfortunately it was a pick up order, so I didn't even realize it until I got home."
3/9/2021,4,"We'd been to the Bento in Boca (which is in an area of schools and business) and liked it. I'd read about this restaurant t chain from Howard H's yelp reviews. So when we saw this location, we figured we'd try it and compare. This smaller location is in a more locals and touristy area of Dania Pointe -- in a row of fast food restaurants.  We chose to eat inside as it was windy out, but there are outside tables, as well. You order and pay at the counter and they bring your food to your table. We'd tried their bento boxes at the other location. It was so much food that I decided to go with a smaller option. Howard had written about his usual dish and I decided to try it. I ordered the bowl with chicken katsu and Japanese curry. You can get it over rice or noodles. I wanted ramen, but they no longer offer them, so I chose lomein noodles. The other noodle option is udon which is fatter and wider. There was a lot of chicken in the dish. Each piece is panko battered and fried then cut into long wide strips. It was served on top of the spaghetti-like noodles. Mixed in to the seasoned noodles were some carrots. The curry was served on the side. It was slightly sweet and very very good. I can see why Howard always orders this. I wound up taking some of the chicken and curry sauce home for a later meal. My husband ordered their coconut red curry with added shrimp -- also as a bowl over noodles. There were a blend of vegetables mixed into the slightly spicy curry. And several shrimp on top. He also liked his dish as well. For fast casual Japanese food, this is really quite good. And the prices are also reasonable -- especially for the amount of food in each serving. We also received our meals fairly fast even though they were quite busy. Service was friendly although there was a bit of a language problem. I asked what was in a particular dish and the gal taking our order just kept repeating a memorized line over and over again. It was kind of funny, but I was trying to make sure nothing was in it that I might be allergic to and/or didn't like. Just to be sure, I ordered something else than I was originally going to get. That was the only minor glitch though. And yes, I'd certainly try them again when looking for an inexpensive fast food Japanese meal."
2/21/2021,4,"I visited this restaurant in the Boca location and always thought their food is good.  Since this new location in Dania Pointe just opened recently, I knew I had to pay a visit.In this visit, I came by to pick up a couple of lunch orders on a Friday.  I arrived around 11 am just after they had just opened the shop.  Maybe because they just recently opened so the staff had not finished preparing the food yet, I had to wait about 30 minutes to get my food.But I guess it was worth the wait.  My chicken katsu tasted great.  I ordered my chicken with Japanese Curry and it was delicious.  The rice was cooked right which was soft and fluffy.  My wife copied my order and she also enjoyed it very much.I'd probably come back maybe during the weekend because a 30-minute wait is just way too long on a working week.  They offer a large variety in their menu so I am sure I can probably pick up something else to enjoy."
3/22/2022,4,"I feel like a three star review is appropriate, though I am giving them a four star review o accommodating our large group for a local Bible study on a biweekly basis. The rolls are small but the fish seems to be quality and the taste is very good. I got the sushi box and was pleased with flavor, one star for portion. Maybe smaller sushi roll I've ever witnessed. Salad dressing and veggie dressing were both good. Great location and parking. Nice and spacious place. Beats other fast food options."
1/9/2021,3,"Yesterday was my second time getting lunch from Bento in Dania. The first time was through uber eats when I ordered a very underwhelming egg fried rice. This time around I placed a take out order through Yelp. It was super easy!I like how they have small orders of rolls so that way you can mix and match. I decided on the Mex Roll, the JB Roll and a chocolate milk tea.The JB roll was good. The salmon is smoked which is not my preference, but that's just a personal taste. I thought the Mex Roll was delicious and would return just for that.My total with tip was just over $17 which for sushi is not uncommon, however, the rolls were so incredibly tiny (size not amount of pieces). There are other sushi restaurants in the area that definitely give you more bang for your buck."
7/10/2022,1,"Don't give this place your money unless your extremely desperate and about to die from starvation. The service was beyond horrible, but what can you expect from a place that hires kids that probably already don't make shit. The sushi that I ordered tasted exactly the same. I also ordered the boba and I was super excited to try the boba.... that was disappointing. If I could give a negative five star review I would."
10/25/2022,3,"MID BOBA, Boba was not good. tapioca is made terrible, and FOUR DOLLARS FOR FRIED RICE, the gentrifiers have done it again. (Food was pretty alright though). WIPB( Jack, Luc, Jeff)"
8/31/2022,5,"Needed a quick lunch with a business partner. We  both did like the quality and portion of the food, the service, and the cleanliness.  I checked the bathroom and felt completely confident to eat there."
7/23/2021,1,"I should have known better than to call in an order at 10pm when they closed at 10:30pm, but I really wanted a veggie roll. When I walked in the pick up the order, they were obviously cleaning for closing or sitting in their phones. Of course that weren't happy about me being there so late, I know I know. But the veggie roll tasted like everything in it was expired, down to the cream cheese. I ate 2 pieces and spit the 3rd one out, fearing that I may get sick. The color of the veggies were a bit off as well. The spring roll was still good though.I will stick to the Davie location moving forward, as I never have a problem there."
5/8/2022,1,"insanely slow service and borderline rudeone girl up front trying to work both the register with a long line, while also making the boba teas.  meanwhile the other staff is barely moving"
7/4/2022,5,"Had the lava roll ,which is basically like a volcano sushi roll, and  red curry chicken bowl. Both were very good !!"
7/10/2022,5,"Great great food everything was super fresh and clean, the  ginger salad  the service super fast"
4/15/2022,1,"Forgot about one of our orders - we waited 2 HOURS for some sushi rolls (easiest thing to make) & reminded them MULTIPLE times. obviously they have no management. (Paid OVER $66 - for a terrible experience. Might as well take your money somewhere else)They kept messing up everyone's orders and mixing up peoples meals, it's a huge mess. Food is subpar - compared to other bentos when I order the same thing. They put two people with the same order number - so our food was left sitting there getting cold unless we got up and went back inside to ask where's our food?? They finally put two and two together. Than waited even more time (over an hour or 2) to get a simple box of sushi. They also made us wait an hour for a boba tea order - once we got it it was all watered down. So what was the point of waiting? It's not like they made anything better with their ""special ingredient"" that they made us wait for. Don't let the new fancy location fool you - they suck might as well go somewhere else where they know how to at least train their employees correctly.They also have no manners (when you're nice to them and polite) they just maintain a straight face ,Throw you your food and don't care. I understand times are tough - but ethically you need to take any job you take in a high regard if that's the job in which you applied for."
4/18/2021,1,"This review is written on behalf of my bf who had an unpleasant experience here. Months ago, we came here together and ALSO didn't have a great experience considering that our food took longer than it should. The manager (an older gentleman) gave us a free drink card that night.Fast forward, my bf came recently came and claimed the drink and ordered a sushi roll for lunch. Upon arrival, he was not greeted. A girl at the front, Angelina, just blatantly stared at him. He took it upon himself to ask ""hello, how are you?"" And still, no response. She still doesn't say a word nor ask how he can be helped. As he orders, this girl gives major attitude and presses buttons on the screen really hard. When asking her what his options are, she continued to stay mute and points at it. And when she did speak, it seems like she's purposely mumbling so she can't be heard. Upon reviewing of what he ordered, she still tried to charge him for the drink. Overall, she was rude. So many things went wrong at this point, and clearly we are clueless on where the customer service is? And HOW this is kind of behavior is acceptable?My bf doesn't ever complain about anything like this but he felt like this experience could've been prevented. He even asked someone at the meal prep station if he could speak to the manager and waited AGAIN, longer than he should. He had to remind them a second time to bring a manager out. Nevertheless, the manager (Maria) was useless. She didn't seem to know what she was doing or clearly how to handle the situation. Not really apologetic to what took place, and was more defensive with her staff. Not everyone can provide excellent customer service, but AT LEAST have decent manners. Not sure how a business can operate with people who can't even do a simple task of greeting their guests, let alone helping with their order."
1/18/2022,1,Maybe not the best place.  At the end of the day is my opinion so give this place a try at your own risk. From 1-10 I'll give this place a 3. Miso soup was watery no flavor. The The noodles on my bento was cold. The protein was great. Hospitality was fair. Environment was ok. For me was disappointing.
5/16/2022,1,Ordered a poke bowl online and found it sitting on the counter when I walked in. Poke bowls have raw fish in them... Had food poisoning for three days straight after. I hope somebody from health department pays them a visit soon.
4/17/2022,1,"Disgraceful service. Cashiers need to be trained on how to deal with customers. While I wait d an ETERNITY for my order, I gave up after 20 min and asked to speak with a manager. The ENTIRE staff at the restaurant had no idea where the manager was and were surprised to find out that the manager had abruptly quit. I got my refund and advised customers behind me NOT to eat at this establishment. Was a sad site to see all the confusion between the line cooks and prep staff. This establishment needs serious help! Will never EVER eat or order food from here EVER AGAIN!"
9/19/2021,1,"Son, I am disappoint... very, very disappoint.This is essentially cheap, conveyor belt 70s Chinese kitchen takeout slop, just re-marketed and repackaged with a more updated look/feel. If it has an app, it must be different! Completely bland and uninspired. Fresh but not flavorful or memorable at all. Seems like cheap GFS kind of  stuff. The decor, location and website/app market it out to be a lot nicer than what you get. Its not bad, really, just meh. I literally could have taken my family to the Chinese buffet down the street for 1/3 the cost, and it really would have tasted better. I don't have a problem paying premium prices for premium fast food. But this just doesn't cut it. They say gen Z is more about the 'experience' but come on, even they have to realize this is just rebranded 70s slop, just without the flavor.The staff and modern decor were great. The rest.... Stick to the MSG... seriously..."
3/13/2021,3,"Man it pains me to give this place 3 stars. This was my fave fast casual asian dining in college- the Pao Pao (spicy creamy) chicken bowl is incredible. People literally flew it to me when I left college and lived in MD. But I've been 6 times now and have had something wrong with my order EVERY time. Expect it to take longer than 30 min whether you dine in or order ahead. Only one of six times was it ready under the 20 min mark. There are some issues from the online ordering site to what prints out for the kitchen. A couple of examples- I ordered lo mein and got a side of plain udon noodles, I said no mushrooms and there were mushrooms, I asked for a side of veggies and there was no side of veggies....it goes on. Check your order before you leave!! Once I ordered it on ubereats. They even managed to send me the wrong persons food! When I called them, they recognized their mistake and asked if I could come in to pick up the correct food because Uber had already closed the order. If ANY other place had this many issues I would not go back. But that Pao Pao sauce is worth the eye rolls, and it's a great price point. So I say go, but know what you're getting into! Or maybe try another Florida location because I've never had issues like this with any of the others!"
1/11/2021,3,"If I had to choose between Pei Wei, Panda Express, or Bento... I'm not entirely sure I'd pick Bento. I think that it's great they offer quick and convenient Asian-style food, and they even offer inexpensive sushi. The sushi, however, is all I enjoyed of my meal. The red curry with tofu was kind of tragic. I know that's harsh, but wow, so was the taste of the curry. The noodles with chicken that I got were absolutely swimming in sauce. I don't even remember what I got because I just remember the abundance of sauce. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back. I'd just strictly get sushi."
9/13/2022,2,This place is vile. Fast food sushi garbage. Fish previously frozen. Bland is a compliment. The rice is like glue. The miso soup is like sipping on salt. Straight up disgusting. Will never go back!
3/6/2022,2,I love the Bento place in Davie and this one was a disappointment. For the high price for fast food sushi it did not meet the standards. Salad was yucky and the pickle salad had no flavor. The rolls were tiny tiny. I will not be coming back to I should of taken a picture of my rolls.
2/15/2022,2,$66 dollars last Friday with my family ... kids meal had peppers in it and my orange chicken was brown in the inside . I didn't know they were going to use dark meat . Disappointed especially for the price .
11/25/2020,1,"We ordered 2 poke bowls for pickup, long wait when we arrived, mass chaos with their team members trying to figure out orders. They just opened so that is completely understandable. However in one of our bowls we found this, not sure what it attached to the cream cheese but we didn't want to find out and threw away both bowls. I tried reaching out to them through email and social media 2 weeks ago and have not received a response. So here's your 1 star review."
8/19/2022,2,I gave this restaurant two Stars only because of the cleanliness. Normally this place would have received a one star if that. Let me start with a warning. If you order chicken and it tastes like fish looks like fish and the staff tries to convince you that it's not fish you should really consider was this the right restaurant choice. My wife had Pad Thai with shrimp I'm not sure who came up with this Chef inspired idea of adding barbecue sauce to Pad Thai but it just doesn't work. You know the food is bad when you place it on the back of your tongue to try to avoid the taste of it. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy and I absolutely hate him.
10/16/2021,5,This is my second location that I have tried & I am not disappointed. Food is always hot and tasty & They make accommodation for specific requests. Great team of workers that are very personable & professional. Worth stopping by if you are in the area.
10/3/2021,5,I wish I can give this place 100 stars... Food is absolutely delicious... And the prices are incredible... friendly and quick service!! EXCELLENT!!!
4/1/2022,5,"To these other people leaving reviews, just get directly to the point! Stop, dragging it out and making us all have to read your long ass paragraphs!"
4/29/2021,3,"I love Bento on Davie, but this location made me sad. It's FREEZING cold inside. The wait time was a little ridiculous. Next time I will order online. I ordered 4pcs Special Mex sushi and I don't think that warranted a 30 minute wait. Then when I got my food it was wrong, so they had to make the correct order. The cashier was really nice and helpful."
9/14/2021,1,"This bento blows. I paid $23 for sesame chicken on teriyaki Tuesday because they ran out of teriyaki chicken at 5pm. So I decided to go with the sesame chicken.  Honestly the food at Asian chao in sawgrass looks way better and that's $8.  I also ordered miso soup and garlic edamame, both horrible as well. The edamame has no taste and the miso smells like cat piss and Tastes just as bad. If you would like my business please reach out to me as I will not come back to this restaurant only the one in davie as they know how to make a great meal. The owner should really be ashamed to serve such low quality food under a great name like bento."
1/17/2022,2,"Bento is a hit or miss. I've come here several times hoping to have a better experience. The chicken here is often chewy/stringy and hard to consume. I've heard their noodles are good, but I do not recommend the chicken. The takeout is not as good as dine in."
5/14/2021,5,"First of all this place has good food, we like it and come regularly. To actually have Pad Thai that uses rice noodles instead of the wheat or partially wheat noodles is great and much healthier and gluten free. But this tendency for small businesses or any business attempting to create their own little fiefdoms concerning government regulations is completely unacceptable. Mobs don't make the rules.The mask mandates across the country during the pandemic were totally unenforceable and had no legislation of any kind backing them. It was simply accepted by the masses thru the spreading of fear, easily half of which was carried out by the media. We are a nation of laws and though it was acceptable to wear masks for a time while this horrible disease was spreading we've reached the other side of it now. It's over!The government and its various medical entities instituted the precaution and have done so before in other pandemics, but again without the backing of law. The CDC DHS and WHO having no enforcement capabilities of any kind. The government started it now the government has ended what they started, nobody else has anything to say about it. The fact that businesses are attempting to force such things upon the citizens of this country is not their business - and it is unlawful.People should get back to the business of minding their own business, which is to conduct business. Not continue to mob others with the mob-rule, of insisting that you do what they want you to because they feel like it. Everyone has feelings, and feelings are not law, and their feelings are none of my business. When they are forced it makes for bad business, forcing things you shouldn't always does that. Customer service has always been a big deal in this country. Good eateries near good hotels have long been considered part of the hospitality industry, not hospital.But we do like their food! When they stop the bully tactics of forcing their customers to do something their business has no control over and no legal backing for - we'll like them too :-) Thank you miss Maria, sister Lyne and the cooks. The yellow and red curries are also amazing. Such dishes remind me of Cocos Curry House in Japan."
12/15/2021,5,I'm one of those pesky vegans who thinks he's better than you. Jk. Seriously though as a vegan I got the spicy crispy vegan tofu in a poke bowl and it was outstanding. I enjoyed it enough to leave this review so that should mean something. My friend got a bowl of murdered animals and rice and thoroughly enjoyed it as well.
10/16/2021,5,This Bento located in Dania Pointe is by far one of the best locations I've ever been  their staff is super friendly and the food is always GREAT! Love their atmosphere and everything about this place.
7/26/2022,1,"Every time I come here I'm disappointed. The food is trash quality for the price. And the employees are not only rude but dont care about any type of professionalism. As I'm standing waiting for food there are people ignoring incoming tickets, on their cell phones, and blatantly ignored me when I walked in. I asked the girl up front how much for an extra sauce she said it was free. When I grabbed my food I asked for an additional one (thinking if it's free it doesn't matter) and the person who I asked snapped back with a disgusting attitude. Definitely do waste your time and money. This was me trying to give them one last chance as I work in the same plaza and was hungry on my way into work. Next time I'll starve."
5/20/2021,2,Was disappointed to see a cleaning staff member clean the floor with a rag and then went on to use the same rag to wipe down all the tables.. Dude! That's like using your mop to clean of your dinning table! How could she not know that was not acceptable .. yuck!
9/30/2021,5,"When it comes to Asian food I'm very picking about where I eat. I really like bentos I've tried a few locations  in the past but this is by far the only one worth driving for.The food is  always fresh and made to perfection !  I   Have  never been disappointed. the place is very clean , and also  Maria  the manager is very kind and personable , she has a great team of employees that are also attentive and friendly."
11/13/2021,2,"Ordered the Florida roll and rice veggie bowl. The roll was okay, nothing special, and the bowl was not good. The rice was under cooked and the veggies over cooked. The tofu was so hard and burned I couldn't chew it and I did not enjoy the flavor of the bowl."
9/6/2021,1,"The worst bento we've been to!! I've been to many locations and normally really like it. We walk in and everything is dirty, the tables have old food on them. We order and every single employee is rude. We sit down after moving tables because it was so sticky and our food was missing something so my husband asked about it and the employee literally said ""ask someone else"" while continuing whatever he was doing. Not worth it. Drive to a different location or go somewhere else."
8/21/2021,1,"Worst Asian food I've ever had.  Tried their food twice and the quality is shameful.  The Thai Fried rice tasted like it has been in a refrigerator for over a week, the vegetables were hard, stale like and only ate one shrimp.  When I felt like I was going to vomit I threw the entire thing in the trash.  Stomach started hurting and now I'm drinking ginger, tumeric and peppermint tea.  There will NOT be a third time.  In fact in my opinion, the health department might want to pay the Dania Beach location a visit to make sure they are following proper protocol when it comes to food storage, handling and safety."
2/21/2021,2,"SLOW SLOW SLOW food ... Before us, after us ... EVERYONE was waiting too too long for our food. Management needs to get on the ball. This is NOT an employee problem. Unacceptable a fast casual establishment. #neveragain"
7/9/2021,5,Great food! Amazing customer service. I love the young people working and showing leadership. I will certainly be back!
4/16/2022,3,"This chain of restaurants does not accept cash. This was not a deal breaker for me but off the bat deters some potential customers. I had the bowl with Lowe mein, vegetables and tofu. The tofu was dried up around the edges and too tough to eat. The rest of the food was so-so. When I asked one of their employees said they had no paper plates. There was a stack of cardboard soup bowls right in front of him. This place was not a horrible experience but I on the other hand wasn't positive enough to especially bring me back either."
3/9/2021,3,Food was okay. Nothing wow. Lo mein noodles with steak were so so. The sushi rolls were small and tasted okay. Probably will only go back for take-out when I don't want to cook.
2/18/2022,5,"Would highly commend there customer service. The orange chicken that I ordered was not up to their usual standard. The manager ,Angela, not only had my order remade also gave me a gift card which goes above and beyond in my opinion. I will be coming back."
11/22/2020,5,"So glad Bento is finally open at Dania Pointe!Visited during their soft opening and had great service and amazing food. We got edamame, orange chicken and lo mein, pad Thai, and taro boba. Everything was absolutely delicious!! Obviously, employees are still training so please be patient. Everyone seemed excited to be there and attentive to everything going on. Unfortunately the dining room was closed when we went so we had to eat outside but the inside is so nice and modern! Can't wait for this to become a go to spot for me :)"
4/11/2021,1,My first time at this location and it is extremely sub par compared to all the other bentos. All the four people I was with had mistakes on there orders and they weren't even busy. The boba tea took 30 minute. If you want bento save yourself the headache and do not come to this location.
5/15/2021,2,"This place seems to have a constant problem with getting their orders out within a reasonable time frame. After waiting 30 minutes for a simple sushi roll I asked the staff how much longer the wait would be and was told multiple times that my roll was being made. It wasn't until I reached the 45 minute mark that I had to ask for a manager and she informed me that the roll had not even been started yet. If you're looking for a dining experience with multiple guests I advise you to choose another restaurant as this location will serve everyone's order at a different time (one of my guests orders came out in 10 minutes, another in 30 and mine almost after 50 minutes). There needs to be more clear communication between the staff and from the staff to the customer. Also, I gave two stars as the food itself is nothing crazy, definitely not anything worth waiting 50 min for."
5/30/2021,2,"I have been to the Bento Box in Davie, which was a very unsatisfying experience. It took 30 minutes to get our cold food. Well I took my daughter to the Dania Pointe one and once again I was upset when I left. I paid 47.60 with a tip you give before you even sit down. The first picture is my meal. I had brown rice,garlic green beans,ginger salad,garlic broccoli with shrimp which adds 1.50 to the meal. Let's start out with the broccoli was way undercooked. Second the noodles that are supposed to be hot and have taste were cold and flavorless. Third I asked the lady that delivered our food was the green beans supposed to be cold? She looked a little stunned and told me ""well they are supposed to be warm"" and walked away!!! The only good thing was the pork gyoza that was nice and hot. My daughter got the. Fried chicken katsu which was piping hot and delicious. I will not try a third time. You can see by the pictures what is good."
12/21/2021,3,"3 stars: The Mt Fuji roll is amazing! but the general tso had the shells still on the shrimp so the entire meal, my family and I were constantly spitting them out. Rice was bland and mushy."
5/14/2021,5,Hands down the best service! We were looking for a quick bite to eat before a trip. Lyné was quick and efficient with getting our order. Food taste amazing. We definitely come here for a quick bite.
8/10/2021,1,Such a terrible experience. Our meals were all wrong. When I came back in the woman Mananger was so unhelpful instead of correcting it. She was worried about charging .50 for a sauce they forget to put in the bag. Never got to eat what we ordered. $46.00 lunch wasted. Even tried to give the woman .50 cash and said she couldn't take it so we never got to get the sauce. What terrible customer service. Stay clear of this location.
12/13/2020,5,"Happy to see Bentos is opening up multiple locations! I first tried them in Tallahassee, fl. This location was new and clean with minimal wait considering it was a Sunday early in the day. I ordered online a kids sweet sour chicken, the bento sushi combo box, a poke bowl and a crunch roll. All was delicious and a great meal for a good price. I made my first poke bowl today and the freshness of ingredients did not dissapoint! Great spot to drop in when you are out and about shopping at dania pointe or in town looking for a quick fix!"
5/1/2021,5,Bento is amazing! I was so excited for it to open at Dania Pointe and it was well worth the wait. The food is excellent and the staff are very helpful and kind. I love the Mongolian chicken bowl and the poke salad (which you can customize). My mom tried the egg rolls and said those were very tasty as well. The portions here are great and service is pretty quick. I've been multiple times since it's opened and Bento has been consistently good! This is my new favorite spot for delicious and reasonably priced Asian food!
2/13/2021,1,"Extremely disappointed with service and food. Waited one hour for the food, asked 2 times and they keep saying that it was almost ready. Keep in mind the place was empty ( now I know why)  and I only ordered 2 plates and 2 appetizers. They did not care one bit, neither said sorry. when the food came it was cold. This was my first time and will be my last time. Do not recommend."
4/18/2021,5,Got a couple things from here tonight. Staff was awesome! Food was great! Will be coming back for sure.
5/21/2021,5,"The Sushi Combination Box at Bento can't be beat... great options, great flavor, great value! When I asked for extra pickled ginger, the customer service was fantastic! Special shout-out to Juan and Senya for going above and beyond to make today's lunch experience as great as it was!"
5/11/2021,4,"The TNT roll was so delicious! The right balance of smokey and spicy. Our 3y old loved the kids chicken teriyaki so much we had to order him a 2nd one. Also, the garlic edamame was awesome! Will definitely be back!"
3/9/2021,3,They make very good rolls but the service is pretty slow. Hopefully they'll get better over time.
1/30/2021,1,"I'm giving this one star because if you compare this store to the Davie store it's like they are not even the same company. I place an order over the phone they tell me 20 min which is no problem . The problem comes when they have one cashier and my food is sitting at the counter getting cold . So now I have to wait for one cashier to take care of a line of 9 people in front of me . Mind you I was already waiting 10 min for the cashier to take 2 people's order . I ask is there another way to pay I'm told no to wait in the line , see ya later I'm not waiting .Every time I come to this location there always seems to be a problem . This store will not be getting my business again."
5/7/2021,4,The food is really good and consistently good.  The rolls are flavorful and fresh.  Give it a try! I only gave them 4 stars due to you have to consistently wait a long time for the food and one of the reasons i sometimes choose to go somewhere else for takeout when i'm in DP.
7/13/2021,3,"So I always go to the bento in davie tower shops and it's the best. This location is convenient because I had just left the gym. Idk what it is, but the taro milk tea and the boba is so gross at this location. I switched it for the thai tea and it wasn't that good either. Also, I got the Szechuan shrimp rice and wasn't that good either :( also the shrimp weren't properly cleaned. Very disappointing."
3/28/2021,5,"Great prices, great food, never a bad meal. I love it, come here all the time.Orange Chicken"
12/5/2020,4,"My son and I are big time  poke bowl fans, but they can be pricey. We checked this place out in Dania pointe on their official grand opening day. My son thought his poke bowl was one of the best he's ever had (granted, I don't usually take him to the high end poke places...hello...pricey!....lol) but he still has had enough that he can tell the difference between not fresh and fresh. I didn't love mine as much but that was because I found the poke soy sauce to not go well with the greens I chose (instead of rice). The portions were quite large. I had a regular build your own and was impressed with how much tuna I got for about $12. The two rolls we had (spicy tuna and Japanese) were pretty good too. The employees were super friendly and attentive. Bottom line: it's a fast food type sushi and poke place, so don't expect amazing, but for the price and convenience, I can definitely say it will be a new go-to in the neighborhood."
2/12/2021,2,"Took 30+ minutes for take out and the food was luke warm, spring rolls cold in the middle.  Good idea, poor execution."
12/19/2020,3,"Online ordering was very smooth and easy, including a place for a special instructions, which I really appreciate. EDIT: I've ordered a few times now, and my special requests regarding the food were totally ignored. And we're talking easy, like ""no lettuce"".) Easy to customize your order by clicking boxes next to which ingredients you want to omit, or in some cases, add. Delivery was fast, and the driver did follow the special instructions. Delivery is by Door Dash.Portion size was decent, but the recipes are wrong wrong wrong. Whoever wrote the recipe for their bulgogi has never eaten it and has no idea what it should taste like. On another dish, the spicy mayo was sweet, which it shouldn't be, and there was too much of it. It would be nice if the ingredients were indicated, like what the noodles are made out of. Oh, and there's a box to check on the online ordering if you don't want utensils, so I checked it, but I got utensils anyway.I really wanted to like this place because it is close and it's very easy to order online, but this isn't even close to Asian cuisine."
11/23/2020,5,"Absolutely amazing food. We've had rolls and a poky bawl. Both were excellent. Boba tea has a bit much sugar for my taste, but I usually get 0, so that's not really a complain. Fast service as well. It's a gem that not many ppl know about yet."
3/27/2021,5,"We just finished eating our meal, we had it delivered via UberEats. Everything was so freaking tasty! I was so pleasantly surprised. I got the poke bowl, and I added string beans AMAZING  I wish I had more. Will definitely order again."
3/26/2021,1,Worst customer service! I ordered online during the day (around 11:50 am). My food said it would be ready for pickup at 12:20. I got to the restaurant early and it was empty. It took the staff about 10 minutes to even ask me for my name and what I was waiting on. There was literally no one there in the restaurant BUT it still took them an additional almost half an hour to prepare and have my food ready. Totally ridiculous. Save your time and go to the other restaurants at Dania Pointe that have far better service and food. My recommendation would be to go in InRamen rather than Bento.
11/13/2020,5,"Just went two days ago, so glad this place finally opened. It's a great addition to the stores in the plaza. The staff were super friendly, and the food was quick and it felt very safe, everyone was waiting for their takeout apart from others. Ordered for a few people so we got a vegetarian sushi roll, mini poke bowl, fried rice, and tofu pad Thai. Only downside the noodles for pad Thai can't be subbed for egg noddles as they are premartinated. Definitely will come back soon."
9/17/2021,2,"Good food but don't come here unless you have a lot of time and patience. It took 5 minutes of me standing at the counter for someone to come take my order. I waited 30 minutes for a simple veggie stir fry. And no... it's not crowded at all... only three tables are occupied. Unfortunately every time I have come here that has been the case. Again, food has been fine but not worth the long wait."
9/15/2021,5,This has become a regular spot for me to grab lunch or dinner. The service is always very welcoming and the food is always freshly made. Lyne is super helpful and has a great attitude. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and a great experience.
12/14/2020,1,I have visited a handful of time at this location and every single time they take forever to deliver an order. This is the last time that I come to this location. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE.
7/24/2021,2,"Loved the location on University but the traffic is crazy in that area so we thought we'd try the Dania shop. Food was good but it took 45 minutes to get it despite there being very few people in the place. We thought we'd try again in case that was a bad day, and bc we love the food. Got there right at opening time, and the employees studiously ignored us. Did not even speak, so we left. The place needs better management, I think."
5/16/2021,4,"After speaking to the manager, Maria, we are assured that we are making right decision by continuing to come here since we love the concept. We love the atmosphere of Dania Pointe.  We were greeted tonight with a much better attitude.  First, the manager, Maria recognized us and went out of her way to see that we were satisfied.  The cashier that usually waits on us, Lia, has a dynamic personality is enthusiastic and very personable.  Usually I do not take one experience and paint the entire landscape and that would not suffice for tonight.  We had the usual experience we were accustomed to the first two times we visited prior to the last one.  The one thing is the food is consistent and very good quality.  I don't know if tonight was like the others because we visited much earlier than arriving one hour prior to closing and being told we are closing soon.  We will be back, thank you, Maria and Lia for your thoughtfulness!"
5/15/2021,2,Very disappointed.  First time I've been to a bento since pandemic and first time at this location.  Ordered 2 poke bowls to go.  First bad experience was they were out of the sesame green beans.  7 o'clock on a Saturday night.  How can you be out of something like that?  Got home to find one of the poke bowls completely wrong.  Things left out that I ordered and things added that I didn't order. It's not that difficult to take an order at the register.  If you can't get it right then don't offer build your own.  I used to love bento as a less expensive option on the nights I didn't feel like paying the higher prices at all the other sushi restaurants.  Going to take some convincing to give them another shot.
7/25/2021,5,"I love this place!! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great and the workers are amazing! I work in customer service so I know how hard it is to constantly be giving to customers, I was eating there last night and even when they were cleaning up, getting ready to close Juan and Barbara and even another woman that took my trash, sadly I could not get her name, were so kind to me to get me another straw for my bubble tea, I could tell how tired they were and they still treated me so nicely I had to write this review. Thank you so much, this is my favorite place to eat in the whole area!"
6/29/2021,5,Best location workers are always friendly and outgoing and food is great. wok fried rice is the best
5/14/2021,5,"Had the most wonderful experience at this location in Dania. At the shopping center getting my nails done and decided to get a late lunch, I'm very glad I did. It was fresh, hot and delicious! I was warmly greeted by Lyne' and the whole staff. Sat in the restaurant to eat for the first time since COVID (usually have food delivered to my house) because it was so clean and inviting. Keep up the fantastic work Lyne' and I'll be back very soon!"
5/14/2021,5,I came to Bentos with my wife and kids for the first time today. Ive worked in several restaurants in my life time and i can honestly say i have never experienced better customer service and professionalism from anyone other than Lyne (hopefully im spelling that right). She  is an outstanding representative for Bentos and you should be very great full for having her.
8/12/2021,1,"I came for the first time, I've heard good things so I was excited to try. This is a new location, and when I showed up, they were out of rice. How is an Asian restaurant place out of rice? When I saw a big cat of rice come from the kitchen, I asked the manager why I couldn't get rice when I saw it there. She had a bad attitude and said it was the sushi rice not the normal rice. She then proceeded, with an attitude, how they had a limited menu sign up that explained everything. She was speaking to me in a very rude manner, where I had to ask her to not speak to me that way as a customer. To a normal customer, limited menu means they are out of a small menu item, not the main ingredient in all dishes. She then proceeds to tell me they are out of milk tea, after I ordered and the cashier proceed to check to make sure they had milk tea. At that point, I asked for a total refund because I did not want to give them any business . If I could give a place 0 stars I would, they had terrible customer service."
5/10/2021,2,"Only putting two stars because they used to be good. Ever since they made the price $10 for a mini poke bowl they put less portioning. On top of that, our order is always wrong. We used to come here all the time my wife and I. But since they've been so inconsistent it's been more of a chore to order from them, really bad service went down hill as of five to seven months ago."
2/8/2021,1,When they first opened they were amazing but over time the food has gotten tasteless and weak. The past 2 times I've ordered from bento the presentation and quaility of the food has decreased tremendously. Don't get me wrong I know it's no high end Chinese food but some more seasoning won't hurt. Save your money and just get your neighborhood Chinese food because this isn't worth the price
2/19/2021,3,Stopped here wanting a quick to go lunch on my way back to work. Ordered a roll nothing unusual. Service at 2pm was unbelievably slow and none of the staff seemed to be picking up slack.  Only 2-3 tables of people dining so not sure what the hold up is. At least a 30 minute wait for a roll...
4/13/2021,5,Every time we dine in the food and customer service is amazing!! Lyné is always super helpful and never rushes my order!
2/26/2021,2,service is poor and slow and they push up into giving a tip when you order. It is self service so why are are you tiping? Food is just ok .The price ok.
11/22/2020,5,The food is amazing! Customer service was great. Very friendly very clean. Food was fresh. Wayyyyyyy better then Panda Express! Way better. I will be back! I couldn't post any photos because I ate whole entire plate
11/27/2020,2,"Food quality was really poor, overall way too expensive for the quality. Really wished I explored other options.  I've had better Asian food from my local Chinese food store. Would not recommend."
11/23/2020,5,I love this spot. The Japan bagel roll is amazing! The service is great and everything I've tried on the menu is good.
1/9/2021,1,"First off, we did feel safe. It wasn't busy, and now we know why. The food, just awful!  Appetizers consisted of a very stale, old, seaweed salad, and box store crab rangoon.Ehhhhhh  Dinner, was mongolian chicken bento box. Watered down ginger dressing, cold rice, and bland chicken. I did not finish one item. Every food court in the entire country has better chinese food than this place.  Pass on by folks."
5/31/2021,5,i ordered the red curry tofu on udon noodles it was extremely amazing. it was recommended to me by the cashier abby she was extremely helpful in navigating the menu and any questions i had. i would most definitely recommend
1/8/2021,1,literally drove all the way just for them to say no cash and did nothing to help terrible service.
8/29/2022,4,"Service was great for such a ""fast casual"" dining experience. The food is good and it's quick and easy. I'd come here again because their poke tasted fresher than most fast casual restaurants and they were very attentive to our table."
9/23/2022,4,"Noodle Bowl with Pao Pao Chicken had a great flavor, big portion size, grabbed a Togo box to bring the rest home. The Rice Bowl with sesame chicken and shrimp is delicious and satisfying. Ufff the Veggie Spring Rolls were perfectly crispy and light, definitely a must!"
2/6/2022,3,"I wanted to give Bento another try, so my husband and I picked up some meals to eat at home. The emoyees who helped us were very nice and the restaurant was very clean but I'm afraid the food just wasn't very good.  This time I had the Mangolian beef with lo mein and my husband had the beef szechuan with white rice. To begin with, the quality of beef just didn't taste very good, more like a cheaper cut of meat. The veggies were good and the lomein was good but there was a lot of oil in the bottom of my bowl. My husband's meal was just ok, nothing special and mostly rice. That being said, I really wanted to like this place but I know I definitely won't be going back."
12/13/2022,5,Staff is welcoming and nice. Food is fresh and never taste like it's been sitting out. Place is clean and well kept
1/23/2022,3,"This location is a little different then the other two I've been to. I can't put my finger in it but it may be the layout? Very interesting for them to basically open during the pandemic so that's a factor too. It was mainly all delivery at first of my memory serves me correctly. Pretty scarce every time I go in there. The location in Davie is always booming, but of course it's next to Nova U. I gave this Bento three stars because it was not particularly fantastic nor was it particularly terrible. Somewhere in the middle. Service wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful. I think it has been a while since I've been somewhere like this-- just in the middle somewhere. Not much to it Lol you order, you eat and you go home. *shrugs* just a quick takeaway meal. I ate inside and took the rest home for leftovers. I would still recommend because they have some cool menu items that have me in a chokehold. Ie the pao pao chicken over udon noodles and the Mexican roll."
5/30/2022,3,"Mixed review.The Good - Location is easy to find on Pines boulevard in new strip mall w/ plenty of parking.Food was fresh, sushi roll & Hawaii Poke bowl portions were good. New location had decent decor & audio system & music.    The Bad - Counter person not very helpful for first time customer, & not providing suggestions to get thru the many food options.NO cash accepted !?!?Very large staff on duty but service was rather slow, even though the location not that busy. No low sodium soy sauce available in the condiments section Food was salty and wife got illPortion large with white rice, but could of used more protein. Prices are on the high side $70 for 2 ppl lunch (No alcohol) in this fast casual restaurant Benton staff rushed in & jump the line, left the restroom very dirty even though they knew it was in need of service."
12/19/2021,1,"Everything is cross contaminated then VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS BE AWAREWent to bento tonight and I had one shrimp on my food, I am ALLERGIC to shrimp. I stopped eating right away and call them I spoke to a manager and she stated ""oh well you always have to tell us about the allergies so we can wipe the wall off completely"" the phone conversation went on for 6 min, she went on about the signs they have ok cool, so I'm like ""so can I eat my bfs fried rice or is that also contaminated?"" She answered ""unfortunately it is cross contaminated you need to inform us"" so I went on saying that then the cashiers should ask each customer about allergies. This is unacceptable, I used to come to this location all the time, I am highly disappointed. This is NOT ok.Today I went to get my refund, the manager Angela (she said they don't give out last names) spoke to me and I was telling her that it was unacceptable that there was a shrimp there, she said ""it is the persons responsibility to tell us their allergies"" I went on ""I've been to this location since I was in college never had a problem, so you're saying all of your food is cross contaminated?"" She said ""unfortunately you have to inform us."" This is unacceptable because i read the menu and if it doesn't have shrimp I don't say I am allergic. Overall dissatisfied with the lack of empathy and urgency. I work in the Health care field and EVERYONE should be aware of this. There should be signs on the register that say this. Also if everything is cross contaminated then VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS BE AWARE they cook everything without cleaning."
12/22/2021,3,"OK this place is pass for me which I hardly ever say. I went here wanting to experience something new and I did however it wasn't that great. The veggie roll was extremely small, as in I thought it was an appetizer or that I received the wrong order. I took a picture of it and shared it. It was literally the length and width of my thumbnail. No one greeted us upon entry, there were no menus to be found anywhere. And because they didn't greet us they were unaware that it was our first time there so we had no idea what the ordering process was. We had to call out to someone for assistance because they were all engaged in other activities. We also had to ask where the menus were because there weren't any posted up or on the tables. The food was plated/boxed nicely but lacked flavor and it was expensive. If you are a true sushi eater or sushi roll connoisseur this will not be your place. This is more for willing to pay the price for a not so quick bite of non traditional rolls. I would say this is fast food sushi. With that being said I will say that the bowl and bento box had a lot of flavor. If anything stick to the those items. This is not your sushi stop. My mom order the crispy roll which was actually the normal size of a sushi roll and she was also disappointed due to the lack of flavor. It was supposed to be a seared salmon crunchy roll.Stick to the bowls and the Bento boxes. I believe those are their strong points."
2/5/2022,1,"Legal tender is a form of money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt. Each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender, but essentially it is anything which when offered in payment of a debt extinguishes the debt.   Imagine two years into the pandemic, you go to buy your dinner I'm at the end of ordering you're telling you that you can't pay with cash they are not accepting cash! Shake my head do better"
8/23/2022,1,#1 Food no good #2 Hygiene no good long hair people serving and makings food#3price 3 order.   71.96$
11/12/2021,5,"This place is my go to always!The spicy cream chicken aka Pao Pao is the absolute best thing ever. I cannot order anything else or stay away from that sauce. It takes the bento box or rice bowl or noodle bowl to another level. They do also have amazing poke but I really think the bento box is the best option. You get your choice of rice, noodles, salad, green beans and a crunch ""dessert"" all in one with your choice of proteins."
9/28/2021,5,"Absolutely love, coming to Bento Asian Kitchen. The food is always fresh, and tasty. There staff is super friendly and accommodating, and did mention how quick they get you in and out the door. Loveccominf to my Bento at Pembroke Pines City Center"
11/1/2022,5,the best quick asian food i've had. better than pf chang or panda express for sure. affordable and comes in large quantities.
12/22/2020,5,"This was my first time trying this place, someone had told me that it was really good and boy was I surprised. If you like Asian food, with a lot of options then you will enjoy this place.I would suggest ordering ahead, we had gone in for take out and ordered on the spot, it took 10-15 minutes, which is understandable but next time I'll probably order online.The food is really good, came out hot and everything was accurate to what we ordered. The one guy we talked to was super nice and helpful, showed us the different options we could go with.The sushi is surprising good, sometimes you get ok sushi from places who have it on the menu just to sell sushi but this was fresh, tasty, and fairly priced.  Overall menu, is fairly priced as well. They also have bubble tea, if you're into that.Dine in is available but they have limited seating in there, maybe 1/4 of the restaurant is open for sit in dining.Overall, great place, really good food, will be stopping in again to try the other products."
8/26/2021,5,"Nice environment, menu is very straight forward food is fresh. Customer service was good can't complain. Some of their foods were big portions which is good because I didn't stay hungry very delicious food."
7/20/2022,4,"Service is great. I am leaving a review to bring awareness of how lazy and arrogant people here are. I was picking up my food and as I was leaving, I see that a younger guy parked in the handicap spot. No handicap sticker or placard. He left his car on so he was running inside to pick up food. I proceeded to point out that he was in a handicap spot. He looked at me, looked at the sign, rolled his eyes, and walked into the restaurant. He kept watching out the window to make sure I didn't take his car. This behavior is gross and just lazy. Yet it's very ""normal"" in Florida. There is no respect for the handicap in this state."
12/9/2020,3,"I was in the area and did a search for food nearby to my location and this popped up. So here I came.  I ordered from my car - the reception was not very good, I could hardly hear them and they me. They also put me on hold for three minutes? I nearly hung up.  However he came back and I placed my order.The restaurant is located right opposite a massive car park, so plenty of spaces for patrons - so fear not.It seemed busy when I went in.  I collected my order, all went well. I proceeded to eat my Crunch sushi roll in the car.  MMMMM, it was ok. But I would definitely NOT order this again - not my fever, but I was curious to try it, as it intrigued me.  I would not go out of my way to eat here again, nor would I avoid it.  However I prefer family one off businesses with individuality for the food and decor, as opposed to generic chain restaurants, and it appears that Bento is one of those."
4/22/2022,1,"DISGUSTING TREATMENT ordered on Ubereats, the restaurant didn't give the driver my drink or put in my extra sauce, had to drive over there myself, was greeted by some guy who looked like he worked back of the house, he asked how he could help me, I explained that I had to drive over here and STILL PAY for this drink that you all forgot to give the driver, and I need my side of sauce, he gets me the drink and tells me it's a $1 for the sauce, I explain that the fact I even had to drive over here to grab this stuff, I think they can waive a $1, so he shrugs says whatever and walks away from me IN THE MIDDLE OF ME SPEAKING TO HIM, I've been in the restaurant business 8 years and have NEVER ever seen such a disgusting reaction to a customer, and I've seen A LOT in the 8 years I was in the game. I should of asked his name because he needs to be fired, or not greet customers if he's gonna be a piece of trash human to them. AAnyways got my drink, got to the car, realized they made the drink WRONG, had to go back in, grab another one, come home to find he STILL DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT RIGHT and I had to sit there and pick out the boba he added that I didn't ask for.(different guy) Onto the manager who was sitting on her phone hanging out that had the audacity to tell me that it's up to the Uber drivers to get the right order.Let me educate this business and whoever from this business reads this, As the establishment that takes the payment, and makes the food, as well as packages it, it's up to YOU to make sure what's in that bag and handed to the driver is correct, that driver could get fired for even opening our food bags, nor do we want them going through it, they're job is to get the food and deliver it. I'm sure the manager didn't say a word to the disgusting man that walked away from me, but you best believe I'll be reaching out to corporate, as someone in the business for so long it takes A LOT for me to get to this point of even writing a review, worst part is I use to order from this place ALL THE TIME, now I probably will never order again."
6/28/2022,4,"I had read reviews and was hesitant about checking it out, however we decided to check it out and it was great. Food was delicious and fresh. We got surf and turf bowl and my husband got a make it yourself. We also got two boba teas. Very good food and the employee at the register was very nice and helpful."
6/2/2020,3,"Bento, you're slipping.Imagine my surprise that this location of one of my preferred chains finally opened. Sheer bliss truly! I do think, however, that they have various kinks to work out.While it seems that they're following safety protocols during the time of the pandemic, I just don't find them very organized compared to other places. It was on a whim that I decided to check them out and so I called and called. No answer except to finally get a message. It turns out you can order online on their website through DoorDash, and so, I did just that and picked up.The entire transaction was seamless. Here's my issue. When I went in to pick up, it was extremely packed, despite six feet social distancing. Not to mention that the lines converged and I was confused where to pick up despite there being a sign. I ended up getting my food relatively quickly and I was on my way.I had ordered a house salad with ginger dressing, a spicy shrimp red curry bowl, and two strawberry boba teas. While all the food was hearty and delicious, they gave me peanut dressing instead of ginger dressing and I only noticed this way later. I usually check the bag prior to leaving an establishment and I did just that, but the colors of the dressings are more-or-less the same. It wasn't until I drenched my salad in it that I realized and it annoyed me.Meanwhile, the spicy shrimp red curry was great for two meals. I ate it with glee. The strawberry boba teas were refreshing, although the color to me was a bit off. I feel it could have been redder, but then again, the base was green tea, so I really don't know. Overall, this isn't the best or the worst experience I've had with Bento, and I'll still return as it's a chain I love, and well, it's the closest to my house. I also figure that between opening shortly prior to the pandemic and the pandemic itself are reasons as to why they're not prepared to do their best (at least at this time)."
12/17/2021,1,"This place has gone so far down fucking hill it's ridiculous. I used to come here all the time when they first opened and it was mediocre but now it's on the same level as burger king. Atleast the food at burger king is hot.Came here tonight after the gym and ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and 8 pc veggie roll with 2 friends. Food came out late and cold as if it were sitting in a sub par refrigerator with lukewarm rice under it. I took one bite and instantly sent it back.2 minutes later the girl shows back up with the SAME BOWL OF FOOD. So instead of remaking it they tried to warm it up somehow which failed. It was the exact temperature as I sent it back but looked like someone stuck their hand on top and pressed it down or something. I flipped the bowl over and walked out. F*** this place, last time me or any of my friends will come here. Ever"
10/18/2021,1,"This location is continuously disappointing. Food is never close to being ready at the time promised. Last time I went, my food was given to someone else and I had to wait almost another hour for it to be recooked. Then last night I arrived 20 mins after the promised time, and they said it would be another 15 mins. I ended up asking for a refund because I'm tired of being disappointed by this place. Getting the refund was another mission and took another 15 mins because the only person that knew how to process a refund was working the food line. Then when I was leaving, all the doors were locked with this sign. Turns out they decided to close 3 hours early."
4/28/2020,5,"This place is always a hit when you want fast sit-down restaurant food.So far the best one has been the once across from the University of Central Florida. However, this location had good food too. The staff was great and the service was fast.The only downside is that you have to cross the street to park your car.  But this is not a fault of the restaurant. It is located in the far east corner of the shops  so it is easy to see. The location is huge and even though they had their dining room closed they had a lot of employees working at that time.The service.was fast."
6/3/2022,1,19$ for a bunch of white rice. I would never order again from this place. Prob the worst I have seen when it comes to poke
5/18/2020,5,"So this was weekends in the making because I kept wanting to try this place in person. That is, until the this virus took my dining out joy!I had a taste for something new and then thought about sushi.After reviewing the menu for a good hour, since I have to be very sure when ordering delivery, I finally decided to order the Miami Roll.It was a plus that they also sold Boba Milk Tea.The Miami Roll was so delicious, I almost wished I had ordered two, but the 10 pieces got me pretty full.It had steamed shrimp, krab delite**, shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy mayo...  I did like the strawberry Boba Milk Tea. It kind of had a strong green tea taste, but was good.My only issue was that it did not have any tapioca balls which was a disappointment.I look forward to trying this place again and hopefully ordering a Poke Bowl"
6/4/2022,2,"I use to LOVE this place, especially for their pad Thai. It was my favorite. I recently moved to Pembroke Pines and I use to go to the location in Orlando by UCF. Their pad Thai was amazing. So creamy, juicy, and flavorful. So I was highly disappointed when I received my order tonight.... As you can see... it's not saucy at all. I put a pic  from the website of what it usually looks like. Might go to the location one more time to try something else out and not sure if they changed the recipe but was dissatisfied."
8/25/2021,1,I have never been so disappointed in bento ever. And today the rice bowl I ordered is just unappetizing and not well prepared. I ordered an orange chicken & tofubrown rice bowl. But when I got home to get to my lunch. There's nothing but brown rice and barely any protein! I've never seen a bento meal look so disappointing. I don't think I'll be eating at bento again. Not this location.
3/9/2021,3,"First time here. Ordered the Korean Chicken Udon noodle bowl and the chicken tempura roll. I was not impressed with the roll... at all. I paid $4 for the smallest roll I have ever seen in my life. The bowl was tasty and the smell coming from the bag was tempting. I wasn't feeling the noodles, but I would definitely order the protein/ veggie mix. If I go back, I would ordered this again but ask for no noodles and replace it with stir fried veggies."
2/12/2020,5,"Luckily, I was invited to the brand new Bento Pembroke Pines location for a ""Housewarming"" prior to their official Grand Opening, and what could be better than to have the house warming on the Chinese/Lunar New Year!I've been patiently waiting for probably over a year for this location to finally open and I'm super stoked that it's finally here!  I drive past this spot nearly everyday, and it's probably going to be my new lunch spot for most of the week, LOL.I brought my wife (Tanya G.), her parents and my kids to the event.  Just like the Davie location, and I would assume the other locations, Bento has a very cool and fun design.  The interior has ample space for lots of customers to sit and a cool feel to it.Hands down my favorite Asian fast food spot.  Yes, it's fast but that doesn't mean in healthy.  Like most spots you make the line, order and wait your food to be ready.  However, they have Rice Bowls, Noodle Bowls, Sushi, Boba Tea and more.My go to meal is the the Spicy Cream (Pao Pao) Chicken on White Rice.  It's great for lunch, dinner, or even a cure for a hangover. I also get the Poke Bowl (with White Rice, Spicy Tuna, Krab Delite, Cucumber, Wakame, Edamame Peas, Avocado, Shiitake Mushrooms, Togarashi, Tempura Flakes and Spicy Kobachi Sauce)... Yeah, that's a lot... but it's Soo good!My wife and Mother-in-Law normally get the Spicy Salmon Donburi or Sushi Rolls, while my Father-in-Law gets the Sesame Stir Fry Chicken Bowl.We all love it and are excited to finally have it in the neighborhood."
2/7/2020,5,"I've waited so long for this pembroke pines location to open! Located in the new pines shopping center that has a publix and other restaurants like coopers hawk and outback. This location is right on the corner of the shopping plaza. Parking is not trouble to find as there is a big parking lot for the plaza.Inside is very similar to the other locations but just more new. Also they have added a handwashing station next to the take out items which is great. There is only 1 bathroom though but there is the handwashing station available if you just needed to wash your hands. When ordering the employees are really nice and are patient and very helpful when ordering. One of the things I noticed now is there is a picture of all the sauces on each register and what they are called.Food: literally everything is worth trying. They have raw fish to cooked chicken, beef and shrimp. My favorites are the spicy pao pao chicken and pretty much any poke bowl or sushi roll. The sushi roll was made really fresh and the fish melted in your mouth- very delicious and it wasnt hard or cold. Overall great locations and nice employees! Will come back soon!"
8/31/2021,3,"Their food is good here but it could be cooked wrong depending on who's working that day and the managers WILL argue with you even if they're wrong!!!! Because some things are clearly written in the menu... The volcano roll with salmon is supposed to have baked salmon on top according to the description and picture from the menu. When I received under cooked salmon On my roll I was told they ""usually just flame it with a torch and it's never fully cooked"". Though I've ordered from them several times this was the ONE time I had ever received under cooked salmon. The salmon wasn't going to kill me but I don't like to consume salmon that way and he should've simply apologized and accepted that a cook messed up.  Instead, he argued with me that the rolls are always prepared that and that it wasn't going to kill me. Super unprofessional. Just saying ."
2/7/2020,4,"Me and my family had the pleasure to attend Bento's Friends And Family event. We've been anxiously waiting for this location to open and we're so excited when the opportunity came up. We're pretty  accustomed  to their menu having dined at their davie location frequently. During this event they offered an exclusive 25% off our entire order. We took advantage and ordered a bunch of  different items:Drinks:1. Lychee slushie - I always love a good slushie and this hit the spot2. Iced matcha milk tea3. Iced coconut milk tea4. Pao pao chicken bowl - my husbands most favorite 5. Spicy salmon bowl with mixed veggies6. Create your own poke bowlThe service was good, you can tell they were still working out the kinks because we were checked on more frequently as normal which isn't a complaint lol. The food came out quickly and quality was just as we've experience at previous visits at other locations. Can't wait to keep coming back :)"
2/21/2021,5,I loved Bentos when I was at UF and was sad that there weren't any closer locations. I was really happy when the location on Pines opened. I placed a to go order through the app to reduce the wait time. I ordered the Pao Pao rice bowl. This establishment is great for quick and tasty Asian inspired entrees.
12/19/2020,5,"This was my first time going here and I think I  found my new go to place. Chinese type of food had always been my favorite . When you first walk in there is someone standing there to  take your orders .or it's where you pick up your food or  dine in .we always choose the take out option so we just waited a few minutes to get our food . They have all types of  drinks ,foods , sides ,sushi I love the bento box option because you get a variety  of things . The chicken was cooked to perfection. Probably could of  used a little more sauce on the chicken but it  tasted great . The salad ,cucumbers. And string beans tasted so good they also put just a little bit of dressing on the salad . The lo main was so good. And the rice I loved how it came with so much for a great price . I can't wait to try everything else ."
12/1/2020,4,"What can I say, Bento is really good. At a higher price point than Panda with more complex offerings, it is a convenient spot to order for pick-up. BTW - Their boba tea uses dairy milk and only dairy milk. I was kinda bummed. My go-to orders is a veggie stir-fry with veggies and Udon Noodles. Packed with veggies, a flavorful soy garlic sauce and the Udon Noodles are so damn good. I have tried their sushi before and the seafood is fresh and the roll is made to order."
2/5/2022,4,"Bento is always a great place to get a really quick Japanese meal, either to go or just sit outside and watch the world go by."
6/16/2021,5,"My wife and I love going all the way to this location. I LOVE the Spicy Korean Noodles and Veggie Sushi Rolls with Cream Cheese. The cream cheese hits the spot and makes it so much more flavorful. HIGHLY recommend!But I don't recommend the Miso Soup...tastes fishy, like trash"
7/18/2021,1,"The worst. This is our first time here. There's a flyer at the entrance that says ""Order Online"". So we scan that to make our orders while we find our seats. We made our order online at 8:01. We're still waiting almost an hour later. I'm literally in the restaurant making this review. My sister was in the line to order her food with my nephew and friend...and they got ALL their food before we did half an hour ago, even though our order was placed online while they were still getting in the actual line. This place has so many people working behind the counter and so many order tickets on the pass. There's no efficiency at this location for online orders. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE."
8/4/2021,3,"You're better off buying Publix Sushi than this place, the service isn't the best  I had to wait over half and hour. If you're gonna up your prices this high at least return some good service. The food was decent but not sure if I'd visit again"
1/4/2022,3,"Smells amazing,  taste average. Wouldn't go again for the price. Boba tea was good though"
12/12/2021,4,"Bento, is a good and nice place mix fast asian food, we order Pork Egg rolls, a 16oz slush, Red Coconut curry rice bowl, and a build a Poke, all the food was really good and tasty, it take just couple of minutes for the food to arrive after ordered at cashier's, the restaurant is nice and modern, clean except for no soap at woman's bathroom, my only reason for non five stars is because after we scan the Menu SQ code, they have a AD for a 15% discount if you order online! So we decide to seat and skip the line, and place our order online and take advantage of that 15% discount!, but after spending that time putting our order online, we receive a error message at check out that say the online server was down, so we have to join the line again and please our order at cashiers, we ask if they can still owner the 15% off, and the lady say no, and she mention that that online never work!. So this is my only disappointment!"
6/5/2021,1,"Waited a ridiculous time to be served!  While waiting two parties of 8 show up AFTERWARDS and get served ALL their food while my party of two wait, and wait and wait.  Finally forced to get up and ask the manager for a refund, and no good explanation other than ""sorry, don't know why it's taking so long"".  Many other options out there folks.  I will not be returning.NOTE: a server, apparently no more than 15 years old, claimed to be the manager and was totally clueless about what was happening as far as service was concerned.SUGGESTION: Put an adult with some maturity in charge so they know how to speak properly to customers!"
8/27/2020,2,"Wanted to try a new Thai restaurant and so we came to Bento. I should have known I don't like ordering my food  up front , paying, tipping before the meal. As we entered we are asked, ordering take out or eating in? We are ushered to the front where this young man said ready to order. We have never looked at this menu and I found it confusing  and not relaxing to view the menu standing and the Man at the register not really helping or explaining the menu. We ordered the volcano roll for hubby and I ordered the veggie red curry sauce meal. We are told to sit down and someone would bring the food. My meal comes out 12 minutes before hubby and its really not edible because its  so spicy my throat is on fire. Why aren't both meals brought out together so my husband doesn't  have to stare at the wall as I try to eat which is rude.I asked the manager to change my food and I asked where is the rice that goes with the meal? I didn't know I had to ask for this . He gladly changed it to yellow curry but this still was to spicy but I ate it anyway. The manager was very nice thank God he was nearby to help.Hubbies meal was skimpy and so was mine. Hubby complained his roll was to spicy .I felt for the meal this was over priced,  and looked like something out of a cafeteria in a plastic bowl with plastic silverware that we had to get ourselves . So what was the point of leaving a 5 dollar tip if waiter didn't ask if we wanted anything else? Thank goodness the manager was near by and we could ask for eel sauce and that he asked how was everything ? For improvement I would let people study the menu sitting down, add some cushions to the hard wood chairs. Also have someone that knows how to explain the menu as well as someone not only placing the food on the table and then say go get your utensils yourself, so rude. Now why the hell did I tip? There are only two other customers and plenty workers at this place so where is the service?The restaurant is pretty but that's not enough to make me want to come back.   Our lunch cost 35.00 this is not cheap for lunch"
9/12/2020,4,"I ordered the mini Mongolian steak with noodles which came out fast, was tasty and portion was big enough that I was able to take leftovers home. I tried the strawberry Ramone drink which had a light strawberry flavor and the carbonation was strong. Its small so you'll need to order 2. My son had the poke bowl with brown rice, onions,  carrots,  fried chicken and steak with teriyaki sauce.  He said it was pretty good,  a combination of his creation. We shared the tempura shrimp sushi roll. It was descent. Today's dinner was good and satisfying.  The restaurant practice social distancing, there'sasink available for hand washing, we felt comfortable dinning in.  Mask are required and no cash accepted right now only debit or credit."
4/18/2021,3,I've ordered Bento for years and not sure if their cutting costs from covid but each of the 4 sushi pieces which i paid $4 dollars for was the size of a dime. Never had a roll this small before
7/22/2021,5,Had a great experience. Food was good service was wonderful! I would definitely go back.
12/23/2021,1,Love bento but so disappointed in this location should have listened to all of the other reviews. Both meals I ordered were inedible the chicken teriyaki was so burnt it had to be thrown away and I ordered Mongolian chicken as well and got about four pieces of chicken In that bowl so I paid 16$ for fried rice. Definitely save your self the trip.
1/10/2022,4,"Came here with a friend for the first time after passing by it a couple times in the past.  Since it wasn't lunch rush, the place was pretty quiet with plenty of tables available. I ordered a noodle bowl with orange chicken and made it a combo. Food was nice and hot and the pork egg roll was nice and crunchy. Bowl was big enough for me to take home and have leftovers for the next day. Will definitely be coming back."
8/20/2020,3,"Placed an online order, food took an extra ten minutes after the pickup time before it was ready. They have dine in, but don't let you stay in to wait for your order, which is a bit unfair to me. This is the second time ordering from here where this has happened. The rolls could be constructed a little better, but they weren't bad. Will probably continue to go to the Davie location instead."
2/20/2021,1,"Dear Bento of Pembroke Pines... you've got major competition with your Davie location!! This Pines location is in dire need of major tweaking! Your employees are not on top of their game! They forgot to prepare one of our orders. They also brought out the Japanese curry that comes with the chicken katsu thick and more thick as if it was a bowl of glue. Wasn't prepared well at all! I have been to this location twice and both times, the service is super slow which is very frustrating for a place that offers a great selection of menu items and atmosphere. I am willing to drive the extra miles to get to the Davie location. That location is always on and poppin, food never late, and always hot and fresh. They are very attentive there and will ensure everything goes right. Only thing right about this place is their location. Please do better!"
3/12/2021,1,"I can not believe the service that I received today saturday the 12, 2021.Ordered about 1 hour ago and the order was not ready. (lady at the front had a horrible attitude when I asked for my food and told me to wait) Also, the food was cold, and what I got to try was bad and they got my order wrong even after I did it online. Im on hold for over 20 minutes as I type this to try talk to a manager and no one answers. the worst experience in a long time on a restaurant.take your business elsewhere! forget this place!!!!!!!"
5/29/2022,2,"This place is not worth your money. I order take out and when I got home they had forgotten to give me one of my meals so I had to go back but the food is super tiny for the price. My rolls looked so thin and small they looked weird, the side dishes $7 or $8 for a handful of green beans and I mean probably 7 green beans in the container. Total rip-off never going back"
4/3/2021,4,"So I've ordered food from Bento's probably more than a handful of times. I was first introduced by my brother when he had the Pao Pao Spicy Cream chicken. I'll tell you right now you can't go wrong with this meal. The flavors and the sauce on the protein is really good. It's literally my go to meal. I recently had an issue with my meal where I place my order online, picked it up, and got back home to find that it was the wrong order. My initial reaction was frustration because I was so hungry but I called and asked to speak to the manager. I spoke to Albert who I believe is the kitchen manager and he was super nice. I truly appreciated the great customer service. He apologized and we arranged something for the next time I come in. I understand mistakes happen and this was the first mistake that ever happened with my order after coming by more than a handful of times. I'll definitely be back because between the Pao Pao chicken and the steamed pork dumping I can't get enough. Oh also, I always get their White Sauce on the side. It pairs really well with the Pao Pao spicy cream. Once I revisit again I'll probably change my rating to 5 starts."
5/19/2020,4,"Always fresh, this location never disappoints. My go to is the Miami Roll with brown rice! There has been a wait (especially during quarantine) but that's because so many people are ordering. Also, great location right in Pines City Center"
4/2/2021,3,"I would have given this place a 4, but the overcooked chicken in my bfs noodle bowl, and the long wait for my poke bowl made me knock it down a star. The crunch roll was sooo goood! At first, they were quick with bringing stuff out, but then my poke bowl which doesn't require any cooked ingredients took the longest to come out. My bf had to go up and ask for it when other people that came after us, started getting their food. When I finally got it, it was way too spicy. It's like the sauce they marinated the salmon and tuna, they just dumped the excess into the bed of brown rice. My bfs sriracha chicken bowl was apparently too spicy and not enjoyable. He said that it tasted like the chicken was cooked in old oil. The restaurant is mismanaged and long wait time for people who go to pick up. Also, the service there is okay. We kept seeing that the guy who kept bringing food out kept messing up other tables orders. I would like to come back again and give this place another chance, so I will update this review if I see any improvements."
1/15/2022,1,Restaurant ran out of a specific sauce therefore I respectfully requested for a refund after multiple attempts to replace the meal but nothing I was interested in. But while requesting for a refund the manager Kyra had both her AirPods in while i was trying to speak to her about the refund because i noticed she only refunded 1/2 of my order (noodle bowl and ginger salad). I was trying to ask her why she couldn't just refund the whole thing but her AirPods must've been loud so that's just rude. Never going back again
1/31/2020,5,"I've been waiting for this location to open! I got to know Bento at the Davie location. This location had a ""soft opening"", so there were no major advertising about its opening because they're still training staff and getting their workers ready. The staff was super friendly! For the price, you get a good amount of food and it's very flavorful. I got the beef udon noodles, it had plenty of beef and vegetables! Will be back to try it's other dishes. This place is probably a little bit more expensive than your typical mom & pop Chinese restaurant, but Bento has a more Asian ""fusion"" flavor as its menu offers sushi, bento boxes and some Thai dishes."
2/29/2020,5,"Was so excited when I drove by Bento and saw that it finally opened in Pembroke. They're having their ""soft open"" and while I'm not sure how that differs from the actual open, I wasn't disappointed by the experience. The interior is much more relaxed and inviting than their Davie counterpart. The food is just as good and consistent. Service was pretty quick too - a to go sushi order took ~10 minutes.Definitely the Bento I know and love from Davie. The variety and quality is excellent. I ordered the Korean chicken in gochujang sauce bento box and a separate sushi combo. The combo is a great value; a California roll and two half sushi rolls for ~11.One of my favorite fast casual spots in SoFlo."
11/5/2021,1,"Took forever to give me one roll that was sitting on the counter while the employees stood there and talked. Once I had to ask for it they got it, after asking multiple times for eel sauce and asking again when he handed it to me and told me he put it in there, get home with no sauce."
2/4/2021,5,"I love my local Bento. Although the food is not super authentic, it is definitely good. My favorite thing on the menu is the krab rangoons. They're delicious. The bento boxes are filling and I love the little cinnamon dessert that comes in them as well. Def recommend"
1/26/2020,5,"I came for the friends & family event tonight. Decided to get two noodle bowls and hot lava roll. Service was quick and friendly. The location was very cute and easy to find. The food  was spot on, they did  a good job, everything was tasty and exactly what I was expecting. This is a great addition to the Shopping plaza!"
12/1/2020,5,"As a sushi lover, Bentos is such a great option for local sushi. It's usually my go to for takeout and they never seem to disappoint. All of the food is always fresh and fulfilling. I love their crunch roll and the fried rice. The service is very fast and the staff is very accommodating. I also use their app to complete my mobile orders for pick up after work."
11/29/2020,5,Really impressed with this place! We ordered take out and it was very fresh and tasty. The poke bowl was a great portion and I love that the Hawaiian included mango slices. Thai tea was actually really good and authentic tasting! Love that they have both steamed and fried pork dumplings.
9/5/2021,1,Second time I come here and second time I am dissatisfied with the service they took my order 7:38 and it's been 40 minutes and still waiting. This happened before as well the food is good but don't come here if you are really hungry. The door says there might be a delay do to short staff but there is no way a Katsu Chicken Bento box should take that long. I asked about the food and they said it was coming out soon. Sadly this will be the last time I come here!
10/19/2020,3,"Bento is very... convenient when you have that Asian craving but don't want to do the work to research a hidden gem. It is very Americanized, so do not expect authentic. The batter on anything fried is very thick here. I've been here many times with friends when we are shopping around the shops and want a quick bite. I recently have come back due to my favorite poke place being closed  (also in the towers) and I have to admit, the poke bowls do not compare :( Bento charges they same price as poke ramen right next to it but skimps on all of the toppings and the fish."
9/24/2020,5,"It's new. It's popular. Right outside of a brand new plaza in the area. It will def get the foot track it wants post-COVID. When I drive by grabbing groceries there's always a line so I decided to finally order from Postmates. The poke bowl was great, depending on the size of your appetite I would just get the biggest one. The smaller bowls are a tease unless you are pairing it with other rolls. The milk tea was a 3/5 for me. I've had from many other restaurants in the area so it's not on the level to replace my favorite at this time. Maybe post quarantine I can dine in or pick up for the full customer service experience."
6/4/2021,1,"Poor service, when coming in after ordering your food online there is a lack of someone trying to help you, they just put the food bags on a table/shelf with the receipt not facing the customer so your just left clueless on what bag is your order and the employees look like chicken with there head cut off trying to avoid all customer. Basically had to go behind the counter to see what bag was my order, (it was there) after asking two different employees about the order and them telling me let me check. Honestly this seem like a lack in management and in training!"
9/13/2021,2,Food was dry.  Rice was stale.  Appearance was horrible.  You could tell they gave everyone stale rice and old fish.  It is definitely not worth bragging about.   I thought I would have a better review.
1/29/2020,5,"This restaurant just opened and it is surprisingly performing very well for a newly opened restaurant with new employees and a broad menu. This is a very nice location with great quality food and great prices to match. I have been several times to the Bento in Davie which is why I have been anxiously awaiting for thii location  to  open. If you've been to the Davie location toon and enjoy that lovAtion you will  love this new location. Better parking, a very nice outdoor seating area, quick service.I will add thaT my only negative as this location opted to go for a standard soda machine over the Coke Freestyle I grew used to in the Davie location."
3/11/2022,1,Never have I had a California roll come to the table and smell old and gross when I opened box cucumbers were all soggy and old tried twice same thing. nothing but kids in there making sushi it tastes like crap sorry that's the honest truth! Will never waste 8.50 again on a cheap made roll with subpar ingredients gross
10/29/2020,3,"First time dining in. For the price I wasn't impressed with the value. We ordered a tofu Bento Box, Chicken Teriyaki Ramen bowl , Crab Wonton, Hot Lava Roll, and Chicken Tempura Roll, two drinks and shared with a group of four. The meals were luke warm, the wonton crisps in the bento box were soggy, the tofu was overcooked and hard and the ginger salad not fresh. Otherwise we enjoyed the teriyaki chicken ramen noodle bowl, krab wontons, and pineapple green tea. The teriyaki chicken was seasoned and cooked well and the noodles were fresh. We spent over $50. Would not return for a family meal but would visit again for lunch for one person only. I would have spent around the same amount at my favorite local sushi bar."
7/9/2021,1,"0 stars if I could honestly...the first time I came here I waited almost 40 minutes for my takeout order. Which is fine, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, maybe the food will be worth it I thought to myself. I asked for an update on my order and the manager responded with a rude undertone stating ""it's coming"". Fast forward a couple months later, I decide to give them another shot.... this time I decided I'll order online and pickup, that way I won't have to worry about long wait times or rude customer service..... I place my order, it says it will be ready in 40 minutes...LOL... okay I'll wait, I show up at the restaurant 45 minutes later and they're telling me oh we haven't even started your order. Moral of the story, don't come here if you want your food on time."
7/21/2020,4,"Ate at bentos over quarantine, so sadly I can't rate their customer service or cleanliness. However, their food satisfied my long taste for home back in Hawaii. I had a poke bowl, a special roll, regular sushi, and a local favorite. I love sushi so this will definitely be my new sushi place. I also had miso soup & milk tea. Although I forgot to order tapioca w my tea, it didn't taste quite the same like how we make it in Hawaii, nevertheless, I finished it so it wasn't terrible. Arigato Gozaimasu, bento  I will be returning soon"
8/10/2021,1,I ordered two fried rice togo and I received one. Then it took them almost a hour to give me the second order. I was returning here after not eating here for a while I guess I was right to not come back!
10/10/2020,4,"It's a strong choice if you're hungry and want something fast but not fast food. Customizable menu with options for a hearty meal. Flavors were on point but it did strike me as a little less healthy and a little more indulgent. Hubs said, ""It'll hold down a grown mans hunger"""
8/27/2021,1,"My first time going to bento and I can promise you never again, it took over 45 mins to get my order, people after me got their meals before me, it was poorly packaged and all the food was flavorless and dry. $30 for 2 small plates and it was terrible."
2/1/2022,5,After a negative experience I spoke with the Manager Bianca and she made the situation right! Thank you and I hope to continue to enjoy the food and ambiance here!
7/13/2020,2,"I've ordered from here a bunch of times. The last 3-4x no chop sticks!! I've had to eat my sushi with a fork, which is very odd. Spending over $50 in food & no utensils."
12/2/2021,2,"I used to love Bento but my last experience was pretty terrible. They've changed/eliminated some of the original bowls that were so good and upped the prices. The management was so chaotic I had to request a refund for my boba tea after waiting over an hour only to find out they had run out of boba. The food was disappointing and overpriced and the management seemed understaffed, probably won't be returning."
8/31/2020,5,I have been going to Bento since they opened their very first location. I recently moved to South Florida and decided to place an online order at the Pembroke Pines location. I ordered my go-to which is the sushi combo box. My food was ready for pickup at the promised time and everything was fresh.
6/13/2021,5,Amazing food a little pricey for a fast food but the taste is amazing  we try the Mongolian noodles and Pad Thai and also a spicy tuna Roll everything was good
12/5/2021,1,"If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would. The only reason I've gone to this restaurant 3 times is because the food is actually very fresh and the food tastes amazing. But, however good the kitchen staff is, is overshadowed by the atrocious customer service given by the owners and front store employees. I say this because every single time I've gone, I've waited over an hour for my food. The first time, not only did they also get my order wrong, but they gave it to the wrong person so they had to remake my food. I let this slide and didn't complain because there's a sign on the front door that said they were super short staffed. As there's currently a pandemic, it's understandable that the food would take a long time. The second time I tried the restaurant, although there wasn't a mix up with the food I still waited a long time. I decided to try the restaurant one more time, and this time order on the app as I knew there would be a long wait. I get a notification from Uber saying that my food is ready. I go pick it up, and they do not have it made. And apparently, the app WAS able to send the ticket to the register but not the kitchen. I was then told by the teenage cashier to not order from Uber eats pickup anymore because it was inconvenient to the restaurant. I asked her to speak to the manager as I still wanted my food, and I wanted it rushed because I had waited long enough. Had I not paid for it through the app anymore, I would have left. After going back and forth with her a few times, she finally called her manager which didn't want to talk to customers, (I heard him tell the employee when he thought i wasn't looking) and he comped my whole meal and said that I'd need to contact Uber to get the refund through the app as he's not able to administer it on his end. If they're as short staffed as the restaurant seems to be, I can't blame the poor young manager for not wanting to talk to ""disgruntled"" customers. But unfortunately, that's his main job as a manager. When I arrived he was helping out the cooks in the kitchen. As a manager, he should drop helping the kitchen staff and deal with the customer. There were so many issues with my interactions at this restaurant. And this is so sad of an issue for me because it's SUPER close to my house and I'm obsessed with sushi and rice bowls. Although I finally ended the last experience on a good note, (the manager took care of my meal) the fact that so many small hiccups happened made them lose what could have been a loyal customer. The company should make sure, BEFORE they partner with any third party app (such as Uber or other delivery/pickup company) that everything works smoothly. The cashiers are the first point of contact for a customer, so they need to make sure that when an order is received (whether it's in person or not) that they confirm it with the kitchen. And the manager needs to actually WANT to speak to customers, and actually communicate any tech problems with the owners/ company so that it doesn't happen in the future."
5/11/2021,1,"Horrible service. I told the employee at the front my name because i ordered online. After 45 minutes of not receiving my food I approached and asked what the hold up was. She then said, ""oh we don't have salmon we can't make your roll."" This is no issue to me, but the fact that my food has just been waiting there and she couldn't have the decency to let me know earlier is frustrating. I waited one hour total for a poke bowl and a roll. Her excuse was that she had no way of contacting me when I was standing in front of her for one hour. She really needs to reconsider her job choices maybe go work at a park somewhere because she is absolutely useless. (this was on may 11, 2021 at 1pm so you could really teach her some customer service bento, come on."
4/16/2020,5,"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in town. I'm glad this business is still operating with everything going on due to covid-19. I usually build a Poke Bowl. The regular size bowl is really filling for one person. If you order a large, I'd say it's shareable for 2. Great quality, fresh food, and friendly staff. If you call ahead to place an order, you'll get 15% off too."
6/5/2020,2,"Very disappointed !!! This was my first time coming to this location, normally I go to the one by Nova University.The wait was horrendous ... not sure why because had plenty of staff working and prepping and the was not much people ordering.Ordered three bowl - - one red curry tofu bowl -rice hard and a very small portion, the tofu was dry and guess they forgot the curry sauce because had none...- one shrimp general Tao with brown rice - same thing the rice was stale, shrimps dry... no sauce - chicken general Tao- same thing!!!!!Horrible!!!!Hope you get your act together .... do not recommend this one location..."
6/25/2020,5,"I love love love Bento since first eating it during my college years in Gainesville Fl. This was the place where I first learned about and began eating sushi. My favorite at the time was the Crunch roll. Tasting this one years later was not my favorite due to their breading but all of their other sushi soooo good! Mt Fuji, Hot Lava, Caliente, Mex and Special Mex, and Fried Avocado are my go to's. I also was a fan of their General Tso's chicken but their Spicy Pao Pao Chicken although a little too sweet is my new favorite! Bento never disappoints and their food is prepared fresh and in a Flash!"
6/20/2021,2,This restaurant does not accept cash?! I wanted to try this place but it is card only. Seems sketchy.
5/13/2021,1,"Funny how they have someone responding to the negative reviews asking me to send an email, yet I did and received zero response. Not surprised!"
12/5/2020,2,My first time at the Pembroke pines location my first impression is the restaurant is clean and orderly also very empty compared to the David store anyway I ordered the Mongolian beef with extra beef and vegetables for lunch ( I ordered online for pick up) I got there and my food was ready for pickup anyway after tasting my food I could understand why the store has way fewer customers than the Davie location the rice was undercooked and rest of the meal was kinda bland but still edible i was hungry so I eat everything long story short the food gave me an upset stomach for 3 hours the lesson i learned is the bento on university Dr. Is worth the extra driving and wait ...
3/29/2021,1,"Normally this place is wonderful...today they should be ashamed of themselves. Their employees have zero hospitality skills. Our food took 25 minutes. Our cold edamame sat at the window while the ""shift manager"" sent our order back as it was wrong. She proceeded to argue with me about how long the food was taking and more so, purposely let our appetizer sit and get cold. The food was not good but after waiting so long we rushed to eat to get back to work. Restaurants have a choice how to treat customers and by the overall attitude of her and her staff she needs to be fired or retrained. There will be no next time. Stay away from this place."
12/4/2021,2,"I placed an order through the phone and I ordered a mt. Fuji roll and a chicken tempura roll with ADDED crab delight. When I got home I realized they had taken the chicken out of the roll. I called to explain the situation and they offered to fix it or replace it, I decided since I wasn't to far I'd just switch it out. When I got to the store, after explaining that I had called about my order the girl at the front took the roll I had brought in to exchange and went to the manager Linai* telling her what had happened, I heard her complaining say I had ordered it like that and that it's my fault it's wrong and afterwards her and the front staff gave me dirty looks. The guy who answered the phone twice I believe his name was javon was very nice and helpful. The food was good overall I just wish management wasn't so nasty."
2/5/2020,4,"Soft opening... the service was absolutely terrific. I hope it stays that way. The food was hot, quick and tasty - but in no way authentic to any Asian culture, lol. So let us call it Asian Fusion. We had a variety - volcano roll, crunch roll, lava roll, Szechuan sauced tofu over brown rice, Pad Thai, Korean sauced tofu over udon noodles, Korean sauced chicken over lo mein noodles, a tofu poké salad bowl, and miso soups. The Pad Thai lacked fish sauce, had no egg, bean sprouts or appropriate noodles! The sauce was also waay too sweet. Lol! Is that even Pad Thai anymore!?!? The exterior of the crunch roll was like gordon's fish sticks when I was a kid - no bueno. My 3 yr old is the miso soup connoisseur... she has it as a starter just about everywhere.. she picked out the tofu and left the broth. (Her go to is Emerald Thai where she cleans the bowl) The sauce varieties are all generic, salty and sweet. (Catered to the American palette?) You order at the counter and get a table number. Food starts coming out to tables in about 5 minutes. What the restaurant loses in terms of authenticity, it wins with service, speed, fresh/crunchy veggies, variety, and generous serving sizes. If you are looking for tasty Asian fast casual, every dish is made to order with your choice of base, protein, sauce and available substitutions. The level of variety makes it highly suited to groups. Meat eaters and vegans will all leave with happy full bellies!"
1/25/2020,5,"Came by for their family and friends event and even thought the staff is still training they were amazing can't wait for them to open officially the fooD is flavored deliciously and taste very fresh.  They offer a large variety off options from poke bowls, rice bowls, various types of noodle bowls. They also offer sushi and a variety of it."
3/2/2020,5,"I'm glad there's a location in Pembroke Pines area. I normally order the saracha garlic shrimp with rice and the poke bowl. Bento is the place to be, there is so much variety to choose from. There's so much parking spaces and friendly staff :)"
1/25/2020,4,Edit: Unfortunately I have to edit my review.This is my second time coming to the new Bento and the problem has been the same both times the sauce in their bowls is basically non existent....The one thing I love about Bento and what I also compliment is how crispy the tofu is and how much sauce is in their bowl (I usually go to the Davie location) They put enough sauce to cover the tofu and the noodles to the point where there's always leftover sauce on the bottom of the bowl. It makes it tasty and makes the meal come together.At the new Bento on Pembroke they only cover the tofu with sauce and then your noodles are left uncovered with the hopes of a miracle..I'm not sure what the difference is if it's instructions for them not to put a lot of sauce or because it's a new establishment the cooks are still getting used to it idk... I couldn't tell you. But from my experience I can't waste money anymore and I go to Bento once a week so I'm going to keep going to the Davie location. I hate being a bother and having to ask for extra stuff when most places I do. I just want one place that I don't have to instruct to make a perfect meal.So if you go to the Davie location and you're looking into this one cause it's closer I truly just suggest you go to the Davie one.Sorry PP Bento gotta keep going to the My OG They make everything at perfection and I'm sure it's just years of getting it right.Thanks for opening and wish you all the best of luck. I also Included a picture of my bowl so y'all could see what I'm saying. BENTO asian kitchen + sushi'sNew Location on Palm and Pines (I eat at the Davie one every week but this one is closer to me yay!)I had a great experience everyone was on point and super pleasant.The customer service was amazing & the location is clean and beautiful..Can't wait to come again   thank you for the invite to your family and friend rsvp housewarming The sauce in my bowl was a little too watery (I know because I eat it so often lol) and when I asked for extra sauce they insisted to remake my bowl.Everyone went above and beyond to make it feel super welcome.Sorry Davie but I got a new place in town P.s. I always order the sriracha and garlic bowl with ramen noodles and edamame (vegan friendly)If anyone suggests anything different feel free to comment.
2/15/2020,3,"The place just opened it seems and it's got great options just like the other ones.I decided to try out the szechuan noodles and it was really salty, and not spicy at all.It had some red peppers on it, but not a while lot.My mom had the chicken garlic broccoli store fry and she said it was good and not too salty.The kids meals, was actually really neat. As it came with chicken teriyaki, rice, green beans, and even some of these cinnamon dessert thing.My sister had a bento box, which is always the best deal.The bento box comes with the california roll and you pick the other 4 pc.Over all the place has potential, but it is still new.The soups were salty. The one from the combo of the bento box and the one from the noodles.I would come back, and with hope they don't put the whole salt shaker in the soups anymore."
2/9/2020,4,"You can tell this place is new because of the newly built plaza and modern dining setting inside. Very well made lay out of the restaurant. Ordering at the front was easy and quick. They bring out your food to your table, but I do think that process needs to be better organized as we had a server approach our table with the wrong food and when another server came to give us our food order they seemed unsure if it was our food until they asked us and we confirmed. But overall food quality was great! The sushi quality for Bentos is by far the best I've tasted so far compared to other locations. My sushi loving self will be back!!"
3/8/2021,5,"I have never been to this place in person, but I order from Postmates often, so I can only talk about the food. The food always tastes fresh and it's delicious. The prices are reasonable. I've never had a bad experience with food and always come back for more."
11/8/2021,1,"I placed an order using their mobile app on October 25 and never received my food. It has now been two weeks and I have not received my refund from the restaurant. DoorDash says the restaurant is responsible for paying me back. I have been overdrawn and cannot buy groceries because I have not been paid back my money. I went to the restaurant in person and was told to send an email because they could not help me. I am still not sure if I will ever get my money back. I feel this is a horrible way to treat customers, especially when it is such a large amount of money. I wish there was a way to give zero stars."
2/4/2020,5,"Just like everyone else on here - I am so excited we have a Bento further south from the Davie location! Seems this location is still in it's soft opening phase which is great and not as chaotic and packed like the Davie one. Smells like new furniture once you walk in! This location is by far spacious, clean, and has a hand washing sink near the fountain drink machine which is great for me and everyone else who likes to eat with clean hands. Haha! I always mix up my order when I come. I don't really have a particular favorite, but this time I ordered the sriracha garlic shrimp bowl with ramen noodles. It was great with it's spicy kick. I also ordered the Hot Lava roll and a cup of miso soup. So tasty! My younger sister ordered a Pao Pao Chicken Benton Box and a fruit slush. Her only complaint was that the slush was a tad too sweet but they had no problem remaking it for her. Yay for Bento and this new location!"
11/6/2021,2,Not very clean usually and I got a orange chicken bowl and they didn't give me the green beans I ask form them after and they never brought them they are my favorite I usually even buy extra. :/
3/9/2021,3,"The two guys taking my order were really nice!!!! They have lots of options in their menu. I came for their sushi. Now, the two stars I removed is because it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to finally get 8 pc of sushi!!! Everyone came and left me there. I'm guessing it's better to Uber eat or pay before you go there. Anyhoo, I had the panko fried Avo and my sister had Japanese bagel. Both was delicious. I would definitely order here again."
1/29/2020,5,"I was recently invited to check out this new location and I have to say it was up to par! The staff was very kind and understanding of my guests diet restrictions. I tried a regular poke bowls with steak, steamed shrimp and added the new sesame string beans (amazing)! I also had two mini poke bowls with spicy tuna, just different toppings. The tuna was fresh and cut perfectly. I also tried the coconut yellow curry with chicken. The vegetables were cooked just enough that they were still firm and the curry was flavorful! The management team did a great job training everyone! Thank you to Bento!"
2/10/2021,3,"I have eaten from here 5 times now, two delivery orders and three dining room orders, two out of the three restaurant visits were on the weekend.The food is so good when it comes out as you have ordered it and in a timely fashion. Both delivery orders and one dining experience was perfect the other two dining experiences were awful.Cashier doesn't even greet me and once I start my order another employee comes over and the two of them start talking. He leaves I finish up and again not a thank you or your order will be right out or anything.Two out of three dishes come out without even a word as to the third and no side of sauce. 10 minutes pass my daughter finishes her meal I get up to ask about the third dish and am told it's coming also ask for a side of sauce (which I ordered). Manager comes over and says everything will be right out. Wait another five minutes still nothing. Finally my husband gets his lunch but still no sauce, I ask again. How difficult is it to bring a side of sauce?Arrive right at opening no one eating in. Place my order.Food arrives incomplete. Bowl arrives no green beans, no sushi order. Girl says they don't come with my bowl, menu states differently. She says it's in the bowl I show her there are no green beans so I sit down she asks the kitchen. Out comes a side of green beans ok no problem. I ask about my four pieces of sushi she says they are coming. Now the place is filling with to go orders, people are coming in and out and all the staff are working on filling the orders including the one girl who was helping me. four orders, five orders filled and picked up, no sushi. I finish my bowl and I'm about to get up and ask for a refund and then finally receive the rest of my lunch. Look down no wasabi! I get some ones attention and ask for a little wasabi and again I'm waiting and waiting....Order delivery you will have better luck. Don't expect fast service here. Keep your mask on because you are going to need it every time you have to get up and ask for something you ordered!"
3/11/2021,1,Very dissatisfied with the treatment that we received today. A pharmaceutical rep ordered lunch for our entire office and one of the orders which happened to be for the doctor did not arrive. We understand that mistakes like this happen but when we called to let them know the lady who bagged the food told us it was impossible because she bagged it herself. She did not want to help us in any way and we had to deal with the backlash from the doctor here at the office. The lady acted like we were lying and we were just trying to get some free food or something. We only claimed one order was missing when we had more then 15 orders. Super disappointed. Terrible customer service
2/4/2021,1,"Ordered thru uber eats, they dont give option for sauces and now I call and get an employee by name Rene who says to me that if I want a sauce to go with my bowl that I need to order again and pay 50cents, seriously!? Uber does not offer an option to add sauce, they just lost a good customer"
2/13/2020,5,"This location was having a soft opening so I decided to drop in for a bite to eat. There was a little line to place the order however the line went quickly and allowed me time to go through the menu and decide what to eat. I decided to go with the build your own. I chose a regular in which you can select two proteins, 2 base- sushi rice, salad, brown rice, poke noodle, 5 add ins like fruit, cheese and avocado, 2 toppings like fried garlic, fried onion, tempura flakes, scallion, pickled ginger and 1 choice of sauce. For my  Poke bowl I chose 1/2 brown Rice 1/2 salad, mango, pineapple, cucumbers, avocado, scallions, crispy wonton topping, tempura flakes, tempura shrimp and fried salmon. My bowl was delicious. I enjoyed all the different textures in the food. I never had salmon fried which was a treat. It kind of makes it a little dry but with the sauces and fruits in the bowl, it adds a crunch. I was so pleased with this place. Everything was fresh and made well. I will definitely be visiting frequently."
2/1/2020,5,Love! Love! Love! I first had Bento Cafe when I was in college in Gainesville but when I moved back home I  couldn't find much to beat my sushi craving. Then when I saw they opened close to home I was soooo excited! I even brought my hometown friends to try Bento and they love it as well! Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something fun and good! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)
2/25/2020,5,"Great quick service spot! Food is affordable and great quality! For cooked food I recommend the pao pao chicken over udon noodles and for sushi I recommend the volcano roll. For appetizer the steamed dumplings are a very generous size, the garlic edamame is amazing, and the crab wontons are great!For soup, my favorite is the szechuan beef noodle soup! A little spicy but I prefer it over pho anyday. I'm not a big pho fan so if I'll take this to cure my hangover."
9/24/2021,1,"I so rarely leave reviews but this was such a disappointment. There was a sign on the door asking us to bare with them for being short staffed. That's fine. I can wait a little longer. What's not fine is waiting 45 minutes for cold rice and noodles and hot salad. The orange chicken was good. The ""Teriyaki"" udon noodle bowl was plain udon noodles with plain grilled chicken on top with some beans. After waiting 10 mins for the sauce it was better. The Hot Lava roll was the nastiest roll i ever had. I've never left so much food on the table after eating. We never got our boba tea because we had to leave. The one star goes to the staff because they were nice I hope they're treated well."
2/23/2020,5,This location just opened. I am used to going to the Plantation location. The food is so fresh and evenly seasoned. By far my favorite restaurant and I have waited patiently for this location to open. I was not disappointed. Manager is so helpful and kind. Staff is friendly and this bright airy location is ideal. Food is to die for. Everything is new and clean. I can't say enough about the food. So enjoyable! Mango Boba tea with mango boba is my very favorite! So much food I will have to take some home.
1/30/2021,2,"Online Order Pick Up-Horrible!This review is only for online pick up experience. Always the worst with this location. Of the 4 times that I have done online ordering, only once have they ever had my order ready in time. Today was the final straw, they gave away my order when I came to pick it up. I was told they would work on it right away. 40 minutes later I was given my order. I saw 6 pick up orders prepared while I waited and  customers come in and order, and they got their food before I got my order. Never was offered an apology or some kind of compensation until I said something about having to wait 40 minutes. That is not a good customer service experience."
3/19/2021,1,"This is THE WORST SERVICE i ever EVER experienced. I placed my order at 8:00 pm to be ready by 8:30. I got here at 8:45 to pick up and i am still currently waiting at 9:07 pm. I asked the cashier when my food would be ready and she said ""5 minutes, They're just cutting up your sushi roll."" Come to find out, 20 minutes later, that they hadn't even made my roll yet. This is probably the most ridiculous time i have ever waited for food. I've gotten in lines at Disney World faster then this... needless to say i WILL NOT be returning to this bento. I like the one in Davie 100000000x better. Also, this staff has A LOT to be desired. I was treated so poorly yesterday it was actually disgusting. The staff was rude and incompetent."
3/16/2021,3,This bento is makes no sense. They gave me the wrong order twice. You have to pay extra for sauce when you order online. The wait is horrible no matter how small your order and how empty the place is. They need help...
12/23/2020,1,"Absolutely dreadful experience at bento in November.  Quality was subpar, definitely don't consider dining in anymore, this place primarily caters to takeout diners now.  Fruit flys everywhere inside, staff sitting around at all the tables, everything is served in plastic soup containers.  Steak Mongolian entree was inedible, practically a soupy stirfry beef dish.  I was expecting something. Resembling pei weis version of Mongolian and didn't come close to anything in the description.  Pei wei is by far superior to bento these days.  Unfortunately pandemic has changed the quality of this venue big time :("
3/10/2021,1,"This is more a review of Bento's service. The food is fine.I have been ordering from this specific restaurant at least 10 times, mostly to deliver. They seem to be using DoorDash to do their deliveries.With my last order, the order was shown as delivered, but no one actually showed up. I tried calling repeatedly for over 30 minutes and no one would pick up the phone for me to let them know of the issue.I eventually had to drive all the way over there to talk to someone in person and was told that they actually disconnect the phones after a certain hour intentionally. It's plain dumb, but it was not the issue.After having talked to someone there, they agreed to prepare the lost order with an expedited service, which they did. But they still needed to credit the delivery fee. The agreed to, but I insisted that they also credit the tip that was given to the DoorDash driver. After much convincing and involvement of the manager, they agreed to credit the tip as well. This was not the issue, EITHER. I would have gathered that DoorDash would credit the entire amount to them for the error.I have waited over a month before posting this review to give them time to process the refund. Not only I was not credited for the tip; they did not even credit the delivery."
2/20/2020,5,"Best place ever!!! I love that I can customize my poke bowl or choose to have a noodle bowl. There's a variety of options to choose from. For me, one of the best fast food places to eat. It's clean and the employees are attentive and nice. The cherry on top is the kitchen is open, so you get to see how the chef cooks your food. 5 stars all the way. Oh, and the bubba tea and crab wonton is soooo good"
2/15/2020,2,The line was horrendous had to wait 35 minutes for our food i order a bowl and you have to pay five dollars for the brown rice and also you have to pay a dollar for the sauce that's ridiculous and it's no different than Peiwei next time I'll be going to Peiwei for sure way overpriced lots of employees and the service is horrible don't understand.
3/1/2020,5,MY FAVORITE SPOT FOR POKEBOWLS! I would have to take a 30 minute drive just to get to this spot but it was completely worth it! Love this spot the food is great.
2/15/2020,3,"Sushi Bento Box is really good but Miso soup which is complementary is too salty I was not able to eat it, don't waste you money buying this additional. Kids menu Chicken teriyaki is good, there are options of chicken or steak, One of our party ordered a noodle soup and stated that it was super salty as well. I understand that the place is soft opened but I would advise to train better the staff. Cashier was not able to split the check on two credit cards and when you go to ask something from the staff no one notice you, but you need to call them even though you have bee waiting for a while and they see you waiting for their attention."
7/13/2021,1,"The hospitality service is very minimal here along with the ridiculous amount of time you have to wait for food there is no way this place will make it for the long haul. The place was pretty empty for the long wait that we had for food. Sushi comes out pretty quickly but For hot food, it takes very long. The staff seems lost and miserable. The sushi rolls were okay but I can't believe they charged for eel sauce in a sushi place. I don't plan to come back to this Bento which is a shame as it's so close to me."
9/27/2020,3,We have ordered take-out a bunch of times. The family really likes it but I was  it so impressed with my box. It was over sauced and bit salty. I will definitely go back but next time sauce on the side.
9/1/2020,5,Ordered from here yesterday and it is the best sushi I have had in a very long time. I had the red dragon roll and spicy tuna roll and they were so good and so fresh. My husband had a pao pao chicken bowl and it was also delicious. I am so excited I have found such a great sushi place in my area. I will definitely try again.
8/28/2020,1,"Horrible service.if I could give zero stars I would.They are beyond slow I even  ordered  online to avoid waiting and ended up waiting over 45 minutes for my order.After waiting they said that I didn't order from them .... after showing them my email confirmation they said they would start the order this is ridiculous customer service.i would never again order from them.They need to get better organized especially when it comes to online orders they are beyond overwhelmed maybe having separate people do app delivery orders,online orders and walk in would help.However I will mention they had more than enough staff even having staff just standing behind the counter looking like lost sheep.Eventually after waiting another 15 minutes I told the girl behind the counter At this point I don't even want the food because I was so frustrated to which she said she couldn't do.I told her I would be calling corporate and writing a review on this experience.After that she got the manager who was nice and did give me a refund.I am very upset because their food and teas are good but not worth the time or experience.Hopefully they can correct this and be better in the future however I will not be returning any time soon"
2/20/2020,2,"Prices are Crazy high for crazy SMALL PORTION. I order a combo box and was given the wrong sushi, what waist of money. This location is too new that the cooks DO NOT KNOW THE MENU. If you want sushi avoid this place and go to a real sushi restaurant where the chefs know different sushi types. The sushi I was given had unidentifiable food ingredients and I ordered the special Mexican sushi. I was given no napkins or utensils in my to go bag. The cashiers were nice and that's the only reason why they get 2 stars or else it would be a zero."
2/19/2020,5,"I really enjoy the food here. I want to transition my diet to become fully vegan. I really like that they offer Tofu in all of their meals. The place is very clean, the food taste awesome. I really like the spicy Kobachi sauce."
1/30/2020,5,"For an evening quick fix, this is the spot! Bentos ambience ALONE is inviting to any ""good food window shopper""! However the food and prices are what will really win you in. We came around 8:10pm, ordered the following: 1. Fried tofu udon noodle bowl with pao pao sauce. 2. Fried chicken lo mein noodle bowl again with the pao pao sauce.3. Chicken tempura roll (4 pc/$3.50) Our food came hot, FAST, and fresh! The total? $25.15. We have enough for lunch the next day. For it being a soft opening, this location functions as if it has been running for a lot longer."
9/9/2020,5,It's was amazing!!! Super delicious and well presented!!!! I found them while looking for bubble tea and the name of the sushi caught my attention!!! Very affordable fast and super yummy!!! My bf and son loves it and can't wait to get more!
4/8/2020,5,"I ordered a selection of bubble teas.  I lived in China for five months, and the four herbal bubble teas (mango, lotus, green, pineapple) I ordered at Bento were comparable to those I enjoyed in Shanghai.  Packaging  of the drinks was spill-proof!"
10/17/2020,1,"I used to be a regular customer until they  went full on Gllobalist and don't allow payment by cash. So I'm glad to give their neigjbor ""Go Pho"" my business and the food is overall is way better too"
12/13/2020,5,"One of my favorite places! Any time I want sushi they are my go-to for affordable sushi with Grade A quality and presentation. For a birthday we even used them for catering and we were not dissapointed. Their selection from poke bowls, ramen, noodle bowls, rice bowls, sushi and bento boxes is vast so you can definitely  find something you like! Highly recommend getting the bento boxes it's like a sampler."
6/13/2021,1,Absolutely the worst customer service. Ordered take out on an early Sunday afternoon when the restaurant was empty. The restaurant took 45 min to prepare my food. The food is overpriced and nothing crazy. You're better off going somewhere else.
2/28/2020,4,Service was ok.Came in and had a chicken bowl.Lil bit salty.I would definitely be back to try something else.Place is very clean and nice inside.This is gonna be a good place for many many years for people to enjoy.Look forward into trying other things on menu.
6/19/2021,1,All I have to say is lower your prices you are a fast food restaurant not no high end place.
10/24/2020,1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service. Management is absolutely terrible. Go to the Davie location.
8/19/2020,1,Found this in my bowl. Reached out to the store and no one even bother to respond me. Zero customer service.
9/12/2020,5,"First time eating here, ordered through their website for my food and got it delivered via DoorDash. Delivery came 6 minutes before which was great. I ordered 2 Chicken Teriyaki Bento Boxes with Brown rice. And 2 orders of Crab  Rangoons. Food came exactly as ordered. I had to heat up again but it was tasty. Will most probably order in person.  Good place for fast Asian food. Want to try something different next time."
3/7/2020,5,"Our food was great. The service was great. The place is nice and very clean. We had 2 bowls with fried rice (up charge) and with steak, Mongolian style. Delish! Can't wait to go back for a bento box. This was a soft opening but it looks like they are headed the right way because everything was on point. Rice bowls, noodle bowls, bento boxes, sushi rolls, etc. The menu has lots to offer. This hidden gem recently opened and it's busy like they have been here forever. They definitely are doing something right and have the clients coming in like crazy. The place was packed but running smooth. The food came out very quick. Cooked perfectly. The manager was very nice and came to talk to me about my shrimp allergy and what had what and how it was cooked. Caring! 5 stars so far."
3/27/2021,5,The manager Albert made sure we were taken care of with any and everything we needed.
2/1/2020,5,"Boba and udon quick service yasssssssss!!!!!!!! Good quality for Asian fast food, alot of variety and delicious boba with a good selection of add on jelly's. Thai Thea with lychee jelly to die for....yummmm. Great vegetarian options, You can basically make anything vegetarian just ask. Nice plaza, still in development, can walk around after, and ample parking."

2/7/2020,1,"Extremely small portion sizes for higher than average prices.  The drinks are made with flavoring powder or flavoring syrup, which is completely unacceptable with some 10+ different boba places within a 15 minute drive.  The drink prices are way too high and they don't even include boba!  You have to pay extra to get boba/tapioca... even the first scoop!  Hell no.And the worst sin of them all?  PAPER STRAWS.  No.  I won't be chugging my bubble tea because the alternative is my straw disintegrates inside of the drink.  I just won't go to your restaurant."
2/10/2020,5,In love with this new location. Excellent service and all the staff was super friendly! The food was very fresh an delicious. I'm very happy that we have a Bento closer to Miami!
2/1/2020,5,Absolutely great food here! Bento box and the rice bowls are awesome. Hopefully they're going to add more to the Suushi lineup like Nigiri. I totally recommend this place.
2/1/2020,5,"We went to the soft opening, and we were  pleasantly surprised. More items on the menu than I expected. The fish tasted  fresh, the portions were good. And the service was very attentive.  We finally found a local sushi place that we love!"
4/15/2020,5,Great staff great food great service. Even with the world on fire due to this outbreak. Bento still came through. If you order please be Patient it's a wait they work as fast as they can besides the wait  it's great. Support your local restaurants and be safe out there.
4/14/2020,2,"I ordered veggie spring rolls, and pao pao (spicy cream chicken) from them through door dash. I was excited about getting this I am 7 months pregnant, so I was ready for my craving. When the food arrived it was in perfect condition as far as being from doordash, it was still warm, and all; it clearly hadn't been tampered with, so I was pleased. Now the quality of the food was pretty bad, both the spring rolls and the chicken tasted like it had been left in oil, but it wasn't crispy it was soggy, and just tasted like oil."
8/7/2021,1,"So hubby and I were undecided where to eat and he been wanting to come back to Bento  since our first experience was great the food was delicious and fresh. We decided to come in today and we placed our order and the young lady super nice great customer service took our order and reviewed our order before sending order to chef to cook our meals. We ordered lychee slush with passion fruit pops so some young man come to our table and tell me oh sorry we don't have passion fruit pops. So I'm like ok what y'all have he said ONLY MANGO. So I'm like ok that ok. Hubby orders his Florida roll sushi and they bring it to the table and the waiter comes and bring it to the table and leave and I'm asking my hubby honey where is your soy sauce for your sushi he's like let me go get it in the station. Hubby did not fine no soy. My son orders siracha something the young lady is like sorry no siracha. My son is like dam really no siracha . My son is like ok no siracha dam YALL can go to Walmart and buy it and satisfy your customers just don't say we don't have find a solution to the problem. Mind you my son is 15. I tell the waiter hey can we have soy Sauce he's like ummm sorry we don't have none. So the second item that I ask for and they done have.  ok and this place been open less than 4 months? He's reply was sorry ma'am but our supplier has not come in to bring in our shipment. I'm like ok I pay 80 bucks for 3 meals and ya don't have crap. So i asked him is there a manager in store now, he was yes we actually have 2 today would you like to speak to one of them? I'm like sure guess what IM STILL WAITING.  they are joke. 3-4 months open they are better of closing it down. This was the Third time trying them anf my last. Like if y'all have no soy sauce or siracha or any type of condiments FIND A SOLUTION JUST DONT SAY WE DONT HAVE IT OR WAIT FOR THE VENDOR TO SUPPLY YOU WITH YOUR ITEMS NO IN INVENTORY. Too bad that such a great place has gone down to crap. I would not recommend it. Not even to the animals."
3/13/2020,4,"Love the Bento Box, especially the noodles. I've had majority takeout ( like 10  times since it opened), and ate in once, and the customer service was excellent! Fair price , good food!"
3/2/2020,2,Came here 3 weeks ago during their soft opening. Ordered a chicken katsu bento box. Encountered some very chewy chicken. Kindly told the manager because feedback is important especially when you are first opening. He said he would address it with their QA manager. Waited 3 weeks and decided to give it a try again. Still soft opening so I was a tad hesitant and decided to get chicken teriyaki instead of katsu. The teriyaki sauce didn't taste like teriyaki sauce at all. That's not what bothered me though. It was the countless pieces of fatty chicken and to top it off I had a piece that was hard. Which I spit out right away because it shouldn't have been there at all. I won't be coming back to this location anytime soon.
3/1/2020,2,"As a regular customer for the Davie location, I must say the pines location has really let me down. Their food is good yet their customer service experience is bad. They regularly miss items from your order. They don't provide the proper quantity of sauces per rolls ordered either. Overall, I must say I will continue my visits at the Davie location not Pembroke Pines."
12/20/2020,1,"This is my second time coming here. First time, food was cold and blah. Second time, the brown rice was hard and cold."
6/17/2020,3,not sure why i called ahead to place an order only to be waiting 30 mins for my food to sit behind this girl for 20 mins while she's entering orders into the computer and guy in the back is ONLY concerned about making drinks???? nova location would never do me like this
2/12/2020,5,"Delicious!! Totally recommend the bubble tea here! We tried the crunch roll and it was amazing, really big and tasty. Hubby got a noodle bowl also delicious. Nice people, good service. We live walking distance from this restaurant so we will come back."
1/10/2021,5,Bento is amazing every time. I am always full with atleast 5 pieces of sushi left from the sushi combo box. You will not be disappointed with any food from Bento
1/26/2020,5,Went to the F&F event! Food was great and staff were super friendly! Will be back after their official opening on the 27th!
9/6/2020,2,"The chicken katsu,  Korean bowl, and kids chicken tereyaki were good. We went on a limb and ordered sushi. I've had the rainbow roll twice and the bamboo roll once. First it smells and tastes fishier than fish. I know sushi. I've had sushi from Hawaii to the FL keys so I'm hardly a novice. This is by far the worst and it's made me sick both times. Actually the last time I had their sushi, a piece of tuna fell off my rainbow roll as I picked it up and the rice under the fish was stained and pigmented from the fish. That tells me the roll was not made fresh and that the fish had been sitting on the roll for quite some time. I will NEVER eat here again. The only reason they got the 2 stars was because the cooked food was good but the sushi was not worth the food poisoning. Oh and if you're thinking, why did I try the sushi twice after 1 bad experience, well my husband ate the first time and had no issue so I thought it was just me but we noticed it was when I ate the sushi and had same symptoms. This place is exorbitantly expensive for selling expired food."
9/4/2020,4,"Been eating here several times, it is not consistent in portion and in taste.  Overall it is still a good meal option.  Just hate to have a good meal and the next is not so good.  Ordered poke bowl mainly.  Curry is surprisingly good.  Steak is on the salty side for my taste.  Give 4 stars because I will still go back at least one more time."
2/29/2020,3,"First time coming here, I placed a takeout order. I order the sushi combo that comes with a full Cali roll & choice of two 4pc classic rolls. I prefer to have cream cheese in my sushi, I asked to add it and I was told no, which is very unusual for a sushi restaurant because sushi is made to order ... however I also ordered a rice bowl for someone who is vegetarian, so of course we don't want any protein(meat) options, instead they'd prefer to add asparagus ....couldn't do that either. I'm curious if this restaurant limits their modifications because if so, I wouldn't be coming back. However, it was still the soft opening, so maybe another chance later on. On to the taste of the food. Wasn't too bad, the rice bowl lacked flavor. Other than that, sushi was pretty good. Really liked the special mex roll."
9/17/2020,2,"I think that the price are very high for what they give you, I got a noodle bowl and taste like the whole bottle of soy sauce was poured into it, my husband had a fried rice bowl with steak and he got 6 little pieces of steak and a whole lot of soy sauce (we counted it) the price was 40.00, will never order again"
7/12/2020,5,I ordered the brisket soup and oh em gee it was sooooooo good!! My hubby had the poke and a sushi roll of some kind and also enjoyed it
12/20/2020,1,"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would! This is the 3rd time I place an order, whether on the phone, or online and when I get there at least 10-15 mins after the estimated arrival time, it's still not ready!!! This last time I went I placed an order at 10:47am to pick up at 11:30am. I get there at 11:45am in a rush to get my food and go and there was no sign of my order. The employees were all looking at each other cluelessly and when I asked for a manager to refund me they said there wasn't one but I would get refunded on my card in a couple days. I called later and spoke to the manager, Ingrid I believe, and she mentioned that she had been there all day, and her only solution was to next time ask for a manager to make the order or call and not place any orders online, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE WHY MUST I CALL IF THERE IS AN ONLINE SYSTEM? EVEN WHEN I DO CALL THEY STILL DON'T GET IT RIGHT. Super unfortunate that this location SUCKS."
4/5/2020,1,"I understand we are all going through difficult times.  However, there are still ways to manage situations appropriately.  We ordered takeout.  When we got home , they gave my son soy sauce instead of Terriyaki.  He couldn't eat it.  We called to speak to a manager to get a new one made and we would pick it up. He hung up.  My husband went to the location.  The manager would not expedite the order but said we would have to wait for all the orders ahead of us, which was about 30 minutes.  We got a refund.  Not cool.  This is the time to build your customer service, when businesses are hurting. We won't be back."
5/29/2020,5,First time here at Bentos. Super clean atmosphere. Great service. The food was fresh & delicious. Mike the manager was super professional & checked on us frequently. Jayla was our server she was the sweetest. Def will be back.
3/14/2020,4,"My boyfriend and I decided to give this new restaurant a try while I'm in town to visit. It was extremely clean and had a hand washing station. We both got bento boxes, which were good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the portions were smaller for how expensive it was. The ginger salad could've been a lot better. Overall, yummy but pricey!"
3/28/2020,1,This was the biggest waste of $40 ive ever spent in my life before you take time out of your day or waist you're money you can just go to the mall or panda express and get food 100x better than this wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy this place will not last long.
3/3/2020,1,Awful service!!!! I ordered through DoorDash and it took the restaurant 45mins to realize they can't fulfill the order and canceled it! The fact that it took 45 to realize that is ridiculous!! Not to mention the customer service to follow was even worse!
1/28/2020,5,I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl.  They used good quality chicken meat and the teriyaki sauce is not too salty or sweet and very delicious.  Will for sure come back and try other dishes.
2/3/2020,3,"The only reason this is getting three stars is because I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant! I love the food here. I often get the Pao Pao chicken. I used to drive all the way to Davie just to get it. So, I was very excited when I heard about this location opening up. HOWEVER, I was disgusted with the customer service!! I've never been treated this poorly at the Davie location. It seems as if they employ a lot of children with no experience.I wish I had gotten her name. She brought the food to the table, and did not offer any sauce. I tried to hold a conversation with her and ask her what sauces she recommended but, she seemed to be annoyed by my question and had an attitude. I asked her for extra forks and she never returned with any. I had to ask another worker. I could not enjoy my meal because I was so upset at the lack of good customer service.  I asked for her name and I told her I would be speaking with her manager. I called the next day, and no one answered so, I've resorted to yelp.  It really hurts me to write this review considering my love for Bento and that it was a fellow latina sister. However, I would not like to see anyone else treated in this manner."
12/15/2022,1,"Ordered Bento from the Collab kitchen. The Avocado Roll as you can see had very little avocado. LoL. The roll was made with regular white rice was not good at all. The Garlic Broccoli Bowl has what looks to be freezer burnt Broccoli, carrot ends that should be discarded, it was cold after the cook asked me to wait an additional 4 minutes and the chicken was awful and gummy. 0/10 would not ever recommend. My first and last time."
8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant. The noodle bowl was delicious, as well. I loved all the different sauce options they had, and how much food you receive for the price. My Husband and I will definitely be back! We love sushi, and we were very pleased with the sushi served here."
9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."
2/26/2022,4,"I liked the noodle bowl with chicken teriyaki. The price is little bit higher than the other restaurants but if you thinking about to try go ahead, you wont regret."
12/31/2020,3,"I frequent the Bento chain quite often, to the point where I have self titled as ""professional bento review writer depending on who you ask"". I am putting it in my bio as soon as I finish writing this. But let's get to it. 3 stars because:Wait time:I used DoorDash to place the order and went to pick it up myself. I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids. It was very quiet prior, with no orders on the shelves waiting for pickup. I walked up and said my name, the employee said it's not ready yet. 20 more minutes go by, it's finally ready. But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent. This is a typical bento, some are better than others. Sometimes they rotate depending on staff or current chefs. But I can't help but wonder if it's a chain, the food should be pretty consistent right? It's not, at least not yet. This visit got the job done, I left full. Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
6/11/2022,1,"Good food but terribly slow. 45 + mins for a bowl of orange chicken?? Are you guys serious? Very slow. Will not be coming back. Waiting for the food is not worth it. When I go to places like bento or similar, I am expecting relatively quick service, maybe my expectations are too high but 45 mins for a bowl of orange chicken is unacceptable."

I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
6/11/2022,1,"Good food but terribly slow. 45 + mins for a bowl of orange chicken?? Are you guys serious? Very slow. Will not be coming back. Waiting for the food is not worth it. When I go to places like bento or similar, I am expecting relatively quick service, maybe my expectations are too high but 45 mins for a bowl of orange chicken is unacceptable."
8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant.

9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."

I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids.

But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent.

Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
6/11/2022,1,"Good food but terribly slow. 45 + mins for a bowl of orange chicken?? Are you guys serious? Very slow. Will not be coming back. Waiting for the food is not worth it. When I go to places like bento or similar, I am expecting relatively quick service, maybe my expectations are too high but 45 mins for a bowl of orange chicken is unacceptable."
8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant.

9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."

But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time.

Brought the untouched veggie bowl with $1 side sauce to my partner at home, which he never ate (unusual for him). He simply replied ""I don't like bento leftovers, only kind I won't eat"". I did add a bit of water to reheat the fried rice to eat on the way back to Jax the next morning but that same flavor was there (thought maybe it was from an outside source) and it found its way to the trash. Disappointing. This was Christmas night, which I do take into consideration prior to reviewing. They were not busy, I'm sure employees did not want to be there, but that's the fault of the company then, they should have closed rather than have upset employees (who deserve to be) then try to keep customers happy. Oh well, on to the next one soon enough."
8/1/2020,3,"My roommate only orders their sushi platters/boxes, but I've only had the bowls here, and they're satisfying and filling. I like the mini udon noodles with a chicken based entrée. I've tried the Pao Pao Spicy Cream (wok fried in signature spicy cream glaze with green and red bell peppers), Sesame Stir Fry (with snap peas, mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, sweet soy), and Korean (with onion, mushroom, bell pepper, scallion, gochujang sauce). Overall, my favorite is the Pao Pao Spicy Cream when I'm feeling for an Asian-style creamy red sauce. It's not too spicy. If I'm looking for a lighter dish I go for the sesame stir fry."
11/6/2021,5,FAVORITE PLACE EVER SO GOOD!! 10/10 recommend the bento boxes are a little pricey but so worth it and a large amount of food for the price. Also great sushi bowls!!
6/11/2022,1,"Good food but terribly slow. 45 + mins for a bowl of orange chicken?? Are you guys serious? Very slow. Will not be coming back. Waiting for the food is not worth it. When I go to places like bento or similar, I am expecting relatively quick service, maybe my expectations are too high but 45 mins for a bowl of orange chicken is unacceptable."
8/14/2022,5,"After reading couple of negative reviews, I was hesitant on going in...but wanted a nice poke bowl.Service was fast enough,considering it was Sunday in a college town. The food was super fresh and tasty.My new fav!"
2/15/2022,5,"Poke bowl make your own, great selection, be sure to decide before you go up or you might be like us and can't decide on 5 toppings cuz they all sound good!Spicy salmon, great texture on fish and nice fat content.  Krab delite perfect seasoning and very tasty.Sushi rice was cooked perfect, soft, delicate, and seasoned well.Sushi chef Kim is on point!"
12/9/2022,3,"Food is really good! I always get the Katsu Chicken with Pao Pao sauce. However, the boba is made with a green tea base and it's not made well. Also, the wait for food it terrible. All of the delivery app orders get theirs before you, which is usually understood however... a 20 minutes wait was a bit too much. So, unless you're an FSU student and want the discount order ahead by phone!"
2/24/2022,5,"I couldn't believe how much sushi came with the tray! The sushi was great quality, tasty, and very filling. Our order was out fast, even in a busy restaurant. The noodle bowl was delicious, as well. I loved all the different sauce options they had, and how much food you receive for the price. My Husband and I will definitely be back! We love sushi, and we were very pleased with the sushi served here."
9/30/2022,2,"Visiting our son at FSU, and saw they had a Bento. I LOVED the Bento at their Gainesville location. We ordered 3 bowls, and 2 salads to go.  When we arrived, it wasn't ready- no problem- we waited. The restaurant was clean, and the employees were friendly.  When we got home we realized my meal (shrimp and Tofu) only had tofu. Not only that, my tofu was EXTREMELY hard. There was a TON of sauce (way too much) and a small amount of noodles (I am not a big eater, so the amount of noodles was sufficient for me, but wouldn't have been for my husband or son) Extremely disappointed in my meal. My husband has red curry with chicken, ordered level 2, it was spicier then he would have thought (he does enjoy heat!) He said the taste was fine, might order again.  My son ordered general Tso chicken, and was good (he isn't a man of many words) I am unsure if I would come back to this location, if I did maybe eat in the restaurant so if there is a mistake it can be fixed."
2/26/2022,4,"I liked the noodle bowl with chicken teriyaki. The price is little bit higher than the other restaurants but if you thinking about to try go ahead, you wont regret."
12/31/2020,3,"I frequent the Bento chain quite often, to the point where I have self titled as ""professional bento review writer depending on who you ask"". I am putting it in my bio as soon as I finish writing this. But let's get to it. 3 stars because:Wait time:I used DoorDash to place the order and went to pick it up myself. I was visiting Tallahassee for the holiday and this was on Christmas night. As expected there wasn't very many people there, I arrived before a slight crowd of younger kids. It was very quiet prior, with no orders on the shelves waiting for pickup. I walked up and said my name, the employee said it's not ready yet. 20 more minutes go by, it's finally ready. But it's cold. Food:I ordered my usual: Veggie Stir Fry Bowl with Chicken & White Rice. They usually put a more generous amount of sauce on top, but this time it looked non existent. I walked up to ask for more sauce, she charged me a $1 for the sauce that should have been on my meal. Waiting another 8 minutes for it to be made. At this point I realized my food was still cold, so I ordered a side of egg fried rice, miso soup, and edamame. All in which came out at a decent time. The fried rice had a weird chemical flavor, it wasn't my favorite. Edamame was good, but didn't have any salt. Used a salt packet from the mountain I have in my car. Miso soup was excellent. This is a typical bento, some are better than others. Sometimes they rotate depending on staff or current chefs. But I can't help but wonder if it's a chain, the food should be pretty consistent right? It's not, at least not yet. This visit got the job done, I left full.

12/5/2022,5,"I've been to Bento in tallahasee before and so i had lunch here because it was familiar. The quality of the chicken itself could be better, but it was redeemable with the sauce (I had orange chicken). The rice and vegetables taste pretty nice too. I love that I could see the kitchen while I was placing my order, and I could tell where my order was (guaranteed freshness!). Quick service too."
4/13/2022,3,"Ordered:Steak & Shrimp Combo Garlic Broccoli Box with White Rice (~$18)Diet Coke (~$4)Aya's take:Although this place was super average, I'm a bit confused by the extremely low ratings. The one thing I will say is that the quality does not justify the price of the food. The portion is pretty solid, though. The box comes with a pretty well-rounded meal although a lot of it seems like ""fillers"" - things you wouldn't normally get but will eat just because it's there. I mainly ate the steak and shrimp with broccoli along with the white rice. Considering the plethora of options at this food court, I would recommend trying other places before deciding on this one."
10/17/2021,2,"I was really looking forward to eating here but food quality is not great! I'm disappointed!! I came here with a friend for the first time and there is a variety of itemsThere so I wanted to try something good and Asian food is always good. The chicken wasn't cooked as good, it was very greasy and I would say it tasted like it was old food! I will not return!"
6/20/2022,4,"Really good Chinese food! The General Tsos chicken and rice was my favorite and I would get it again. The sichuan was ok, definitely not spicy enough! I preferred the rice over the noodles. Overall good food and decent prices. 4/5 because no free water ;("
9/24/2021,4,"My volunteer group met at Armature Works because they have a huge outside seating area and in the time of Covid that's a great thing.Before our meeting I went to Bento to pick up some dinner. I went with the Korean bowl with chicken because it sounded like everything I like. It was delicious! Also, it was pretty quick too. I didn't have to wait long for it to be ready. My only complaint is they didn't have brown rice. It is listed as a choice on their website.I would definitely eat here again."
11/27/2022,2,"Food was just ok; nothing worth going back for.  Excessively greasy, vegetables not cooked correctly (Mongolian noodle bowl with steak).  Watched a colleague unwrap and pop a candy in his mouth with his gloved hand.  For a place with so many up charges, you'd expect better quality.  I have it on good authority that the restaurant in Orlando is better, so I'll try it again, but not at the Armature Works location."
10/13/2022,2,"This place wasn't terrible. If you like Panda express, don't mind paying double the price, and a $5 upcharge for fried rice, this is the place for you. Avoid our mistake and look around for better food in armature works. The food was OK but not worth the exorbitant prices. $6.50 for a drink and egg roll?"
2/20/2022,3,"Mediocre dish (I got the red curry rice bowl with veggies) at a decent price in Armature Works. Very long wait on a Sunday around 2pm, but that was my fault for coming on a Sunday!"
6/9/2022,4,"I see a lot of not the best reviews for this place but I have ordered many times, I get the same thing and I LOVE it. The Pao Pao chicken bowl with an upgrade to fried rice is so good. It has the perfect amount of sauce with it drowning. The chicken is crispy and the sauce adheres well. I got there late to pick up my online order and it was still warm when I got home. The portion generous, I saved leftovers for the next day. I'm a happy camper =]"
10/10/2021,4,Last night I tried Bentos for the first time. I liked the vegetarian options they had available. I ordered the pineapple sweet and sour tofu noodles. The tofu was fried and had a nice texture (usually places just cut it up and leave it as is). The noodles were fresh and the vegetables were crisp and not over cooked. I would compare it to Pei Wei and would definitely do it again. I didn't feel gross after eating it and will probably try the General Tso's Tofu or Korean Tofu. The food did take a while to come but it was a Saturday night and was very busy. The food came hot and freshly made. I will definitely have it again in the future. The other people in my group really liked their food too.

9/6/2022,4,"No, this isn't a place for authentic Asian food, but it's fast, and most of the food is reasonably tasty.I came with low expectations, having reviewed the yelp reviews. But I needed a quick meal close to MOSI, and I was tired of feeding American fast food to my kids.We ordered a veggie sushi roll, a kid's chicken katsu box, regular edamame, and a chicken katsu with Japanese curry bento box. The kids also got strawberry Ramune, and I had a honeydew milk tea with honey boba.The food came out as it was prepared (you order at the counter or online, but they do bring the food to your table), and the sushi came out about 5 minutes after we ordered and paid. My kids previously hadn't liked sushi, but my son decided he liked sushi on this visit. Score! There's nothing mind blowing about a veggie sushi roll, but if this was a first positive step towards more global tastebuds, I'll take it.The food overall was reasonably tasty and reasonably well made. My chicken katsu was crispy. The Japanese curry tasted correct (I'm assuming they use the same box curry blend that most people use and/or buy from MD Oriental). The noodles and green beans in the bento box were room temperature. The salad was forgettable. I'd have preferred that they not do the sugared fried potsticker wrappers as they were oily nothings that no one liked. But the rice, chicken and curry were fine.All in all, we enjoyed our meal at Bento, and my son has requested that we return. I thought the restaurant was clean, the service competent, and the prices were about right for a fast casual restaurant."
6/13/2022,4,"Based on the previous reviews, I did not have high expectations, but I actually really enjoyed my meal here. The counter person did her best to be helpful when finding out I had never been, and I appreciated the effort. I ended up ordering the sushi bento box, which came with a California roll, choice of two half rolls off the classic roll menu, some noodles, and a small salad.  I also ordered some miso soup and a fountain drink.The restaurant was clean, with a crisp, minimalistic look, and there were plenty of tables available.  I love that they had blue Powerade at their fountain, which was perfect after working out. The sushi bento box came out very quickly; the miso soup took a bit longer.The miso soup was outstanding. Very flavorful, with fresh mushrooms floating on top. The bento box was good, and though the noodles were bland, the highlights were the half Rainbow Roll and other classic roll I chose.  Not the best sushi rolls ever, but very enjoyable.I would definitely stop here again if I was in the area. Yes, it was more expensive than the average sushi restaurant's bento boxes, but it was also more convenient and quicker than going to an actual full service restaurant."
6/20/2022,5,"This location of Bento is top notch!  Very friendly staff! The food options were slightly overwhelming though because everything on the menu sounded fantastic! We got the garlic string beans, lo mein, make your own poke bowl, miso soup, orange chicken bowl, crab Rangoon, and spring rolls. EVERYTHING HIT! The spring rolls were extremely flavorful. The sauce that comes with it is not that good. Probably my least favorite part of the meal but the rolls are so good the sauce is not needed. The lo mein was spot on! Really enjoyed the build your own poke option. They have pretty much any combination you would want. If your in the area definitely go check out this location!"
12/21/2022,5,"I'm born and raised in Hawaii, when I saw Bento I got so excited!! And I was even more impressed with the quality of food. Love this place!! Will definitely be one of my favorite spots to eat!!"
5/9/2022,5,"Super worth meal with big portions, and I even had leftovers.I had the LoMein Bowl with Shrimp. It has red bell peppers, onion, bean sprouts, carrots and scallions. Natalie at the cash register was super sweet and was very knowledgeable about the menu. Pro Tip: ask the cashier their opinion or even for fan faves. Next time, I'll have to come by and try the LoMein with their fan favorite Pao Pao Chicken."
8/2/2022,3,"Dunno what it is about this place but they always take 15-30 minutes longer than advertised when you place an online order. consistently great noodles and fried rice, though. skip any of the fried meats, they're always soggy and gross."
6/5/2022,2,"Their main dishes are good but over priced to the max. I paid $15 for a main meal, some rice, noodles, noodle crackers, and undressed salad (handful of lettuce). The rice is not enough and the noodles are unseasoned. My total for this meal was $15 when I think it should be around $9. If anyone is interested in an authentic bento box, I highly recommend Sa Ri One Kitchen. Their bento boxes come with so much more and cost around $11. I understand the restaurant is a chain but I'm highly disappointed with how highly my meal cost."
11/22/2020,5,"Since Bento had their Grand opening I've been back 2 more times. All 3 times I ordered online and picked up my order. Each time I got the dragon roll with no Japanese mayo.  I'm addicted. Did you see how red the tuna was on my roll? Great quality and it didn't break the bank!I'm a sushi lover, so when I find a great affordable roll I crave it! I go to East Tampa either once a week or every other week and I always get on Fowler to get what I can't get on my side of town. Affordable sushi and poke bowls happen to be 2 of those things.So, the next time I go I have to try one of the bento boxes. Not sure if I can stay away from the dragon roll, but I have to try something else.The food is clean and delicious. service is fast, the restaurant is clean and online ordering is on point. What else can you ask for?"
10/15/2020,4,"This Bento has great setup among many Bento I have been to. Set up is very nice with indoor or outdoor dining. The elevated outdoor concrete floor serve a very good view and away from the vehicles. I have sushi box with yellowtail caliente roll and salmon roll. It come with California roll, goyoza, salad and spicy cucumber pickles. This bento box is fresh and good. The food do improve a lot from old day. My wife have bento box of chicken katsu. The chicken was two flat pieces. It also accompanied with noodle and brown rice. The salad and wonton skin also includes in the box. There is not much of service. It is order at the counter and bring a number to your table. Food was delivered by your number."
2/21/2022,1,An Asian restaurant that doesn't serve tea. Overpriced menu and it is OILY.Not to mention girls who work there are picking their scalp.SERVICE: 2.4/10AMBIENCE: 5.8/10FOOD: 2.3/10First and last.
11/6/2020,5,"I went to Bento for their grand opening today and it was amazing! Shame on anyone who came on here before their opening today and left a less than stellar review. I've been to the St. Pete location previously and loved it. So when I heard they were opening up a Tampa location I was so excited.Today I ate the Mongolian beef Bento box, the garlic edamame, fried pork dumplings, miso soup and a Thai tea with honey Boba. Everything was fantastic. The Mongolian beef had so much flavor and I loved the options that came with the Bento box. I did not have to choose between rice and noodles... I got both! The Bento box also comes with a ginger salad and cinnamon sugar wonton crisps for dessert. Every single item in the box was amazing. The garlic edamame was really good as well. The miso soup was perfect for fall-ish weather and the fried dumplings were also great. I wasn't expecting the Thai tea Boba to be as good as it was.. I liked it so much that I ordered a second one before leaving. The texture of their Boba was the perfect texture and the Thai tea was delicious.Aside from the food being stellar I thought the staff was awesome. They were very attentive all of my needs and believe me I asked for a bunch of things! While the location near USF is a 30 minute drive from my house, I will definitely be frequenting Bento in Tampa."
5/6/2022,5,"My go to is always a Build-A-Poke with salmon and tuna. Love how many different topping options there are! The fish was fresh and the rice was cooked just right. I always get the dressing on the side, that way the rice doesn't get soggy from it. Would recommend, 10/10!"
5/4/2022,5,"Ordered the Orange Chicken bento box and everything was delicious! I thought the portion size was good and had enough leftovers to bring home. Next time, I want to try their Pao Pao Chicken (their signature sauce)"
1/30/2022,3,"Kinda disappointed, food was ok. I got the orange chicken and some of the pieces were raw. We also got the rice bowl with chicken and it was good. Pretty expensive for the quality and we waitied about 35 min for the food."
12/1/2021,1,"The customer service is poor and cleanliness is below average. The cashier that took my order had a terrible attitude and handled my order unprofessionally. I also observed one of the employees use a cleaning cloth on multiple surfaces to wipe down the tables, the fountain drink dispenser, and seats. There was a delay between the time I place my order and when my food was prepared, I had to walk up to the counter get the attention of one of the cooks to inquire about my order. Only after the cashier heard me questioning the whereabouts of my food to the kitchen did she make any attempt grab my food and bring it to my table. To make matters worst the restaurant wasn't busy at all, there were only 7 patrons in the establishment counting myself. I will not be visiting the restaurant again and I wouldn't advise it to my colleagues to visit."
3/20/2021,2,"This was my first time here, and I told the cashier that and she was really nice her name was Issa. Explained the whole menu to me and was very friendly. Customer service overall was good. The food took a really long time to come out which I thought was weird because it wasn't really busy. The prices do not match the portions size. A side of fried rice was 6$ and they up charge for fried rice. They need to have a small bowl and a large bowl because the regular size bowl is way to small for 10$. The fried rice wasn't really that great quality wise. I wouldn't come here again, I will definitely just stick with the Asian mom and pop shops they are less stingy with the fried rice lol."
5/3/2022,1,Nothing ruins your Bento experience than getting to a Bento that is empty and has a 20 minute wait on the kitchen... and no boba teas available!
6/1/2022,2,Let me start this review off on a positive note. The food is really good. I recently tried the katsu noodle bowl and the mt fuji sushi. It was really good but the service not so much. I'm not sure if it's just because they were busy but this has happened the last two times I've came here. I did my order online and they gave me a time. I came to the establishment at said time. I was advised that it's coming soon. 20 minutes later I'm being told the same thing despite the fact that I did my order almost an hour ago. They are very slow when it comes to bringing out your order. It's crazy because what's the point of ordering the food online if it's not going to be ready by the time you get there. I can understand waiting another 5 or 10 minutes but 20? That's ridiculous
8/28/2021,5,"This is a delivery review.Delivery is difficult to get right. It either soggy, wet, cold, overcompensated for in some way, or just plain out terrible. Bento is hands down the best delivery order I've had (not including pizza, of course) on Uber Eats. It was delicious, appropriately sauced and arrived quickly and HOT! Good enough I wasn't sure whether to plow through or save for later. I order the veggie spring rolls and Pao Pao Bowl.  Keep it up guys it was great."
9/4/2021,4,My first time going here. It was pretty little that great for first date. I got red coconut curry it chicken n shrimp bento box. The curry was really good with little sweet but with little kick also. The chicken was tinderbox not dry. The shrimp was perfectly cooked n not rubber. Highly recommend it if your for some Southeast Asian curry.
11/29/2020,3,"I stopped here for a late lunch ona Saturday afternoon.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I had a rice bowl with teriyaki chicken and an order of spring rolls. The spring rolls were sort of crispy, but very mushy inside, a sure sign they were previously frozen and reheated.  The rice bowl was tasty.  Rice was fresh, chicken cooked properly and veggies were crunchy. I may return and try some of their other options."
10/1/2020,1,"I was soooo excited to finally try this place after seeing their promotional news segment on YouTube. However, after receiving my order I was immediately underwhelmed by the  strand of hair found inside my entrée (see picture). During Covid, I trust that every restaurant establishment is aware of the necessary precautions that should be taken to ensure the safety and health of the public. Upon receiving my order from door dash, this was not the case. I give this place 5 stars for packaging, they really have honed in on providing an excellent presentation. However, I didn't want to chance the possibility of getting sick from eating my order, given the additional human hair garnishment. Needless to say, I unfortunately had to throw away my order but may try them again in the near future."
9/21/2020,5,"My eyes almost popped out of my head when I saw that there was activity at Bento when I was across the street at Blaze Pizza. It turns out that they are in a soft opening right now. From what I've already experienced I know that I am going to be a regular customer here. Bento provides a wide variety of dishes to choose from with sushi, bowls, and bento boxes being some of the many choices. You can add/remove proteins and ingredients to make your perfect dish. What I was really excited about was udon noodle soup. It's extremely difficult to find a restaurant around here that serves it with chicken. And finding one that I actually like has felt impossible. Ichiban sushi down the street on Fowler used to sell it, but they stopped years ago and now only offer a seafood variety. The udon noodles were cooked exactly how I like them and on top was some delicious chicken katsu. Honestly even though I'm looking forward to trying their other dishes if they only offered this I would be happy. The lo mein noodle bowl was a hefty serving and would be quite filling. The fried dumplings were a miss for me. They are more of the crunchy kind and the dipping sauce was spicy. That's just personal preference though and some people will prefer both of these. I can't wait to try more of their bowls and Bento boxes.Another thing that made me really excited was that they sell boba tea! Right now during covid-19 I am only getting food from places that offer curbside or delivery. My favorite boba tea place isn't doing this and I have been suffering Boba withdrawal. While it's nowhere near my favorite, I did enjoy their boba tea. They get massive points for having large paper Boba straws that did not get soggy while I was consuming my drink. I wish that we could adjust the sweetness level of our drinks because mine was sweeter than I normally would prefer. The Boba was more of a mini Boba variety, but again some people might prefer that.Right now they are delivery only during this soft opening. I had a little hiccup with their website in that it would not allow me to place an order because it said it was too close to closing time. However, I was able to use DoorDash without a problem and place an order a few minutes later. Small problems are expected during a soft opening and hopefully this is something they can work out. I think this is a great addition to the USF area!"
12/1/2020,1,"This was our first and, likely, our only visit. We ordered online but ate at the restaurant. The only thing we had that was appealing was the miso soup. It had a great umami flavor, the portion was generous, and it had plenty of tofu and seaweed. That's where the my enjoyment ended. I had the katsu bento box with steak. Calling it steak was a gross overstatement. The texture of the meat was incredibly off-putting. It was almost mushy. Aside from the color, it was not actually identifiable as beef. The order was not quite ready when we got there, yet when I tried the first bit of katsu, even the breading wasn't crisp. The only nice thing I can say about the bento box was that the rice was properly cooked, and the ginger sesame dressing on the salad had good flavor. Beyond that, a total miss.Same with the beef bulgogi bowl my husband had. We both love Korean food, but the sauce didn't even taste like bulgogi. We ordered a 4 piece roll and wakame salad, too, just so we could try different things on the menu. The roll was sloppily made, fell apart easily, and tasted utterly bland. I'd wager Publix sushi is better. As for the salad, my husband said it was ""decent.""  Not exactly a glowing review. Between food and beverages, we spent more than $60 for food that was a major disappointment. I'm not sure why or how the Yelp reviews are so complimentary."
12/7/2021,1,"Food is bearable, service is decent hence the one star. What I can't stand is how sushi rolls used to be eight dollars an hour $10 also some rolls for 1115. That's price gouging if any, you are in a student/university town. If you're going to charge this much, at least step up the quality."
4/12/2022,1,"Peak lunch and they were dead. And they are located at a great location so that should tell you something about the food. However, my review is base on sevice only because I didn't even get a chance to eat. Starving, I ordered 2 bento boxes and a roll of sushi. Came up to $63. A bit much for a single and lunch at that, but I couldnt of cared less. I just wanted to eat. Before I could even pull out my cash, the cashier gave me a disgusted look and told me they were a no cash business. Okay... I was extremely surprised because there were zero signs. I could of easily paid with my card, but this little toot made me feel as if I was behind the times. That cash was so prehistoric.  Apple pay and cards only you old hag. I was starving so I took the abuse. I reached down for my credit card only to look up and found her sitting back down at one of the booths. I walked out and walked over to Pollo Trop. They were super nice, food was good and accepted  both cash and credit. But man, they were packed! I wonder why..."
12/13/2021,1,Less than a mile from my workplace and they don't deliver.  Instead chose another company that did.  Oh well.
3/23/2021,4,"5 stars for the staff. They were so friendly and helpful! 3 stars for the food. I got the sesame stir fry and it was good but not great. The veggies were fresh, which I appreciate. The noodles were just okay. I did not care for the dressing on the salad. I'll probably go back and try the sushi and a boba tea."
6/23/2022,5,"BENTO - moved here about 5 years ago - Temple Terrace is lacking in good, consistent, and delicious food. Have not had a let alone decent but edible Asian cuisine since Chattanooga and prior to that Metro-Detroit; Toronto. Love, Asian particularly like Cantonese - Bento's Cantonese type dishes are so wonderful, prices are very good for the great high quality food and amount. FINALLY, after two long years of cooking and ordering a few really bad meals from the small selections of restaurants in Temple Terrace we have a clear winner BENTO'S EXCELLENT 10 STARS. PS not sure if there are deserts will have to check into that. We ordered: Pot Stickers; Egg Rolls; Sushi SPECIAL-MEX (order more wasabi and ginger); General Tao's Chicken and Shrimp Yellow Coconut Curry Box. YUM!"
6/18/2022,1,Went to get two rolls for lunch right around a little after they opened check out was nice and fast and was hoping to get the food at a reasonable time but from the time we ordered to actually getting the food was 30 minutes. The restaurant was pretty dead too but there were several orders that where served to a table after I had ordered mine. When I went to address my concern I wasn't even addressed until I politely made got the cashiers attention after 5 or so minutes watching the server pack to go orders. When I asked about my order she's said it would be coming out right now which made me think she forgot about my order entirely. The food isn't bad but this isn't the first time I had orders get ready 20-30 later after I ordered. A couple times I ordered to go and the time the site said it would be ready the order would take an additional 20-30 minutes. I don't usually write bad reviews but it's just been consistent with the problems I been having.
3/14/2022,1,"Decided to go to Bento sushi with my wonderful family. I was excited for my Sweet and Sour chicken. While eating I was surprised to find an excessively long pube in my first few bites. I decided to ignore the first one, however I continued to find surprise pubes spread throughout it. Overall would not recommend unless you like finding moderate to excessively long pubes in your meals. Enjoy :)"
1/4/2021,3,"I would first like to say that this rating is based only on how I feel about the menu for this location. The quality and service at Bento is always tops - five stars. I have been going to Bento restaurants (in Orlando and Gainesville) for years now so I was super excited for this Tampa location. The restaurant inside is very clean, and spacious. I had no problem dining-in, I was safely distant from other tables. They also have hand-sanitizers installed for you to use and they are following all safety Covid protocols. When it comes to their menu, it kind of looks overwhelming at first, because there are so many options for how you want your bento box, rice bowl, poke bowl, or sushi combo box. Once you get through the menu though, you will realize it's quite easy to order what you want and the staff are more than willing to help with any questions you have. The Tampa location menu offers a lot, BUT I AM TRULY SAD about this one item that is missing from the Tampa menu. It is available at other Bento locations and I always order it when I eat at Bento. The item I'm talking about is the SZECHUAN NOODLE SOUP - soy braised brisket, bok choy, scallion with ramen noodles. I even checked on Bento's official website to see if they still have this item on their menu, and they do! It's available in Orlando and other locations in FL, but not Tampa. Since I was bummed out about this item not being served at this Tampa location, it kind of dampened my mood to want to eat here. Also, I brought my mom with me to eat here for the first time and raved about how she would love the Szechuan Noodle Soup dish ( my fault for assuming this was offered at the Tampa location and not checking the menu beforehand) But not all hope was lost! They have the Spicy Donburi bowl (tuna or salmon, avocado, masago,cucumber, wakame, spicy mayo) on this Tampa menu which is one of my favorites at Bento. Also, I tried something that I've never gotten before - the Garlic Broccoli Beef Bento Box which was pretty good but I would like to try a different option next time. Honestly, the Szechuan Noodle Soup is my ultimate go-to favorite and since this Tampa location doesn't have it on their menu, I will continue to support Bento at the locations that I am used to going to in Orlando and Gainesville."
11/7/2020,5,"Have been waiting for a Bento in this area for so long! Was sad that it wasn't a full menu like the other cities - please bring the noodle soups here! This is a great go-to when you need a good, cheap, and fast Asian meal. Lots of choices! Rice bowls that we love are the pao pao chicken, general tsos, spicy korean, bulgogi, udon soup, and curry/katsu. There's not a lot of sushi choices around here, and their rolls are pretty good. Not much for sushi/sashimi choices, but you can get poke bowls and dons which are decent (DIY mini poke bowls are a good small size for me or they have premade choices like salmon dons). Mt Fuji, hot lava, and TNT are my favorite rolls! Plenty of space indoors and a few outdoor tables. Employees are wearing masks so that's good. There's also an easy ordering system when you download their app and pick up on the shelf. Takes almost 30 minutes to be ready though. Enjoy!"
11/9/2020,1,"We had food delivered from Bento by Postmates. It was awful. Tasteless teriyaki sauce, miso that only tasted like salt and the worst was the meat. I paid extra for steak but what I received was a disgusting mystery meat. It had neither the texture nor flavor of beef. It was soaked in a ton of liquid smoke flavor which made it even worse. I suspect it was some sort of vegan meat substitute.  We won't be ordering from this place again."
8/25/2021,2,"Service *Food ***Price *Value *Cleanliness ****Ambiance  ***The S O works nearby so always looking for new lunch spots and decided to try this place. As you can see from 2 stars ,not impressed! When placing our order ( Hawaiian ""poke"" style rice bowl, and a Stir fried noodlebowl), it would have been nice to have been told  at that time the noodle bowl was going to take nearly a whole hour to prepare! My wife had to go back to the office so after waiting a half an hour she inquired about the order and said we were waiting on my noodle bowl. Another 10 minutes and it has not come out , I ask this time and was told waiting for 1 thing.‍ I was offered a  complimentary ""meatless"" soup or salad but I declined , said I just wanted our food we had ordered. I asked for my wife's order so she could eat, they gave it to me and The Hawiian bowl with tuna had maybe 2 oz of tuna, 4 small cubes. Now 55 minutes after ordering my wife went in ready to ask to be refunded for the other food but it was now ready. Seriously? 55 minutes for stir fry shrimp veggies and noodles? I could have gone to China Star a block away for basically the same thing and it would have taken 10 minutes or less! And it would have been half the price ...Our 2 bowls, 1 as a combo , was 35.00!! Outrageous! I don't mind paying for great food and amazing service , but this, I am sorry to say, was neither. On the plus side the food tasted okay and the restaurant appeared to be clean. An hour for stir fry?? SMH."
9/25/2021,3,I ordered the Volcano sushi and the Sesame Stir Fry Noodle Bowl. The sushi was SUPERB. The Noodle Bowl pissed me off. The noodles were overcooked and sticking to each other at the bottom of the bowl. The other items in it were decent. I really only ate the chicken and shrimp out it because the noodles made me gag they were so mushy. So upsetting and a waste of money tbh. I would say I prefer one of the rice bowls as I had it before but my mother had an order of it this time the rice was burnt.
11/27/2020,3,My partner and I ordered takeout from the newly opened Tampa location this Friday evening. We ordered two ginger salads and two red curry katsu rice bowls. The dressing on the salad was forgotten as well as one of the curry sauces for the main dish. Although we were very dissatisfied the food we did receive was great. I know it take a while for a new business to get their bearings but I expected a little more thoroughness from this company after frequenting other locations often.
2/15/2022,3,"I enjoyed my poke bowl but I paid over $19 which is too expensive for a fast food type place. That price included a 12% tip which you feel obligated to leave when you pay with a credit card and it prompts you to tip. This always leaves a bad taste for me. I tip waiters who served me, but I don't want to tip someone for ringing up my food. For that reason I wouldn't go back."
4/5/2021,1,"Food was bland and overpriced, service was horrible, would never eat here again. Stay away!"
12/7/2021,2,"Over all the service was fine but the food was beyond not worth 60$. The miso soup was okay at best, the boba was absolute garbage. Didn't cook the boba pearls all the way through so they were hard and there was some flavor in the smoothie itself that was just odd. Overall, I should have just gone to one of my regular places but I certainly won't be wasting my money there again"
11/22/2020,5,"We had a great experience at Bentos today. We walked into a beautiful, and clean restaurant where our cashier was very helpful and personable. After sitting down to eat, we were treated with great courtesy. I was visiting my daughter who goes to USF and my other kids (22, and 25) were with me. Everyone was doing what it took to keep it clean and safe during this uncertain COVID time and I appreciated the extra care they took to keep the restaurant open.Julie Heitman"
5/8/2021,5,Good place but I wish they could have more variety of sushi it would of be so good i love the boba drinks also
4/10/2021,3,"So I like the place, SOMETIMES. The reason I say only sometimes is because I've had occasions wheee the chicken is plentiful and thick and times where a chicken box would have chicken crumbs or fat/skin breaded and fried to crispy chunks of nothing. Another thing to be prepared for when coming here is to know they only take card, no cash! This was a big surprise to me as I ordered over the phone one day and came with only cash. Would be a good heads up to mention this over the phone and posted online. What I do recommend to be good consistently are the poke bowls, I love getting steak teriyaki, shrimp and extra crab sticks for $4 it's super filling and you get to play with all the mix ins. Place is very hit or miss and service is alright, they take a good amount of time to make orders especially when busy."
5/5/2021,5,Our fave for quick and easy dinner. Order the family meal deal ahead for a party in a hurry. We always go for Pao Pao and Coconut Yellow Curry with a Japanese Bagel sushi box. 5 stars every time!
3/16/2021,4,"First time visiting Bento...I got a rice bowl w/ Teriyaki chicken, sushi and an egg roll. The hubby got steak noodle bowl, fried rice with steak and sushi. IMO I would give it a 9/10 only because my rice was cold and my husband noodles were cold other that that the food was good. The wait was about 10-15 minutes."
8/18/2021,4,"The food is good, but the service is slow. Go with plenty of time to eat. In other words, if you are thinking of popping in for a quick lunch, this is not the place."
12/29/2020,5,I was pleasantly surprised by Bento. It was my first visit and I ordered a Volcano roll (freshly delicious) and Szechuan with Chicken. The portions were great and everything was delicious.
1/2/2021,5,"Our new favorite Bento. Their Saturday night crew today was awesome. They took care of all our needs in a friendly and welcoming manner. The guy at the cash register had an especially great attitude. Food was fast, fresh, and delicious. Perfect end to a long theme park day."
3/12/2021,2,"I love bento and have eaten their food countless times, but since moving to Tampa I have been horribly disappointed. I would never leave a bad review, but I have had my order messed up every single time I have come to this location. I have had the shrimp I ordered substituted for chicken multiple times without being asked first and without getting money back (shrimp is an up charge) and they never have white sauce which is the only thing that makes their fried rice good in my opinion. I love bento but if this location doesn't improve, then they have lost my business for good."
10/18/2020,5,Our first time eating here. The place is super clean and serene. The food is fresh and just perfect. It is not overbearing with sodium like usual asian restaurants.  Definitely found a new favorite place to go.
12/30/2020,4,"Order delivery a good bit, usually spot on and pretty quick. Have had a few minor mishaps, but it happens. Will continue to order."
2/3/2021,5,Loved this place back in Orlando and glad they have one in Tampa near USF. Had the Mex roll and Mt. Muji- SO GOOD!! Also- first time I was able to actually tolerate wasabi.
11/17/2020,5,I ate there for lunch. I got a rice bowl which was fresh and absolutely amazing. The large had much more food than I could eat so there are leftovers. The staff was attentive. This was my first visit. I will be back.
10/6/2020,5,Ordered online and got my food In a timely manner. Tasted great and decent price. Will definitely be back!
3/16/2021,5,Had heard about this new restaurant on Facebook and it is awesome!  Curry was delicious. Mongolian beef was superb  and the steamed pork dumplings were some of the best we've ever had.  We can't wait to come back again!
4/9/2021,2,Just to make everyone aware.. this is not an authentic Asian  restaurant.. you will like it if you like Americanized Mall Food Court food. Not awful however it's not my cup of tea. Service was good..
12/4/2020,1,"It took 45 minutes to get our food no manager apologized for the wait. No one came and told us oh your food is taking longer I'm sorry. And people who ordered after us got there food before us. When we went to ask where our food was at the 30 minute mark they said ""working on it now"" with no apology again. We were super excited to try this place for the first time just super disappointed about customer service."
11/24/2020,2,"Food is great! This is the second time ordering. The reason for the two stars is because they forgot about my order. 30 minutes later walked in, it was not busy and people that came in after me got their orders. They did apologize but to easily forget someone's whole order, and no where near busy, is upsetting. Spent pretty much my whole lunch break waiting."
3/16/2021,1,Went here for dinner a few nights ago and my family and I witnessed a female worker being harassed by a male worker. My kids even knew what was going on and said it wasn't right. The girl served our table and was so sweet.
1/8/2021,2,"This spot was unique but the food selection was terrible. They were out of nearly everything! They ran out of dark chicken, teriyaki chicken, and brown rice, and that's only in our order. They did not offer fountain drinks and only had a few drinks in their fridge. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. Our server did not offer us our complimentary sauces and did not seem very enjoyable. They messed up my order by adding white rice instead of fried rice."
9/25/2020,4,Tried this place out tonight got the sushi combo. You get 16 pieces of average size. They also have a lot of other things poke bowls and soups and main dishes. sushi was good.I'll go back. I'd give it 41/2 but can't get it to give me a half
9/29/2020,5,Great hospitality! Everyone was great there. Food was awesome too. I got the orange chicken with ramen noodles and must say it was the best food out of any other bento locations I've been to.
4/13/2021,5,"favorite sushi in all of tampa, it's a bit pricey for the quality but oh well. the sushi is hit or miss though, if your roll isn't good one time, DONT GIVE UP ON BENTO!! THE NEXT TIME IT WILL BE BETTER! their chicken tempura roll is pretty delicious, something unique about them, pao pao bowl is yummy as well"
8/14/2022,5,"***VEGAN/ PLANT BASED REVIEW***Discovered Bento last night on DoorDash. Super appreciative that they have vegan options. Got the avo roll (without the spicy mayo), and tofu fried rice (no egg). It was delicious and super filling! I spit the entrees over two meals. Will definitely be ordering again and may even go to dine in."
7/22/2022,4,"Got a good deal through a delivery app, their bowls look good, so we ordered General Tso (breaded, fried) chicken with lo mein noodles and garlic gochujang tofu with udon noodles. Portions were great, almost a little big for me. The gochujang sauce had a beautiful heat, the one that goes in crescendo until your whole mouth (and throat) have a nice lingering burn. Not too spicy--somewhat medium high heat--but may be too much for those who don't tolerate spicy foods. For those of us who find like every single Asian restaurant tones down (or turns off!) heat for Americans, this will be a nice dish. The tofu squares were perfectly cooked, big, slightly fried, absorbing quite a bit of the sauce, and many of them! Udin noodles were the good kind of chewy.  Wish there were a bit more scallions or other veggies in addition or in lieu of the green beans and peppers, but still tasty. 5/5 to me.The General Tso's bowl, however, was somewhat disappointing. It was sweet, no heat at all. Quite a bit of sauce though. Tasted like  average Asian takeout.  My husband thought it was very good though, sp because it wasn't so greasy like many Asian lo mein takeouts.This is our 2nd or 3rd order with them and I think they are pretty consistent. Would order again!"
6/26/2022,1,Omg I haven't ordered here in a long time and I said I wasn't to anymore. I should've listened to myself. It was raining so this was the closest restaurant to my apartment. The sushi was like 90% rice. I got a very slim piece of tuna in the roll. One of the pieces was plain rice!!! Ridiculous for paying $10+ for mostly rice. Sloppy work. I also ordered the veggie udon stir fry and the sauce tasted weird and artificial. It tasted like a bunch of chemicals. I remember the garlic soy was pretty good but they definitely used a different bottle of sauce this time. It was thick and they drenched my noodles in it. I had to rinse off the sauce in a strainer when I got home. Yes. It was THAT bad. I did not enjoy my meal at all. I want a refund. It ended up going in the trash even after I rinsed off the sauce. Disgusting. Stay away.
3/27/2022,5,"Soooo good! I had the katsu box with tofu, white rice, and Japanese curry sauce with a side of spicy mayo sauce. I loved the noodles, they were so flavorful! The tofu was perfectly breaded and fried and tasted wonderfully with the curry sauce! The green beans were tasty although I did wish they would've been just a tad bit more flavorful, perhaps with a hint of garlic. The rice also paired very well with the curry sauce.I really wish I lived closer to this place because if I did, I would eat there all the time!"
3/16/2022,2,"When Bento first opened in Saint Pete, we were so thrilled :) the service was wonderful, the food was plentiful and the entire place was always clean. Even during Covid when they reopened, it was still pretty good and clean. Now, this is what they're serving for eight dollars a roll. It's a thin cut piece of salmon, not sushi, but these thinnest piece they could cut. The sushi at Lure or even Publix far surpasses it. The crab wontons are literally a no crab oily mess with just some cheese, absolutely terrible. I'm so sad about how downhill this is gone.This has nothing to do with supply demands or anything else, it's overspending, poor management and too many store openings without keeping quality control. Such a shame."
3/3/2022,5,"5 stars simply for the food itself. Location is pretty as well. I ended up ordering the pow pow chicken with rice and green beans and will definitely will be coming back for it. It was crispy sweet and creamy at the same time. I'm confident you will be addicted to it after just one bowl. The boba on the other hand is just ok. I was also not allowed to pay cash, card only at the time I visited so If you're one to use cash only I'd recommend having a card to try this gem out."
11/4/2022,4,Only found out the special from the website. Set price for 4 entrees. Decent deal
3/24/2022,2,"I have eaten here twice now and each time it has been nothing but disappointing! The food just doesn't taste fresh. It's more like a fast food place. The sauce tastes canned/bottled and so artificial.The tofu was so deep fried and hard, both times, no wonder why my friend who ate here hates tofu.If you like fast food/panda express Asian food, you might like this. Definitely not for me."
4/19/2022,2,"So disappointing.  Came in and picked up a menu at the door...we chose to order their signature udon noodle bowl with katsu chicken, the signature wok bowl, and a Hawaiian poke bowl.  But I can't write this review on any of those dishes.  Upon getting to the order/cash register, there was a laminated sheet on the counter with a lengthy list of the ingredients they were temporarily out of.  I don't know how you could order anything other than a simple sushi roll off of the menu, because the list of ingredients they were out of was so long!  No peas+carrots, onions, katsu chicken, garlic broccoli, udon noodles, veggie spring rolls, pineapple, mango, lavender lemonade...the list goes on and on.  Seriously, there is a Publix next door...couldn't management have sent one of the many employees to go buy some onion and frozen pea+carrot mix in order for their kitchen to be able to execute any of the rice dishes?   The kitchen staff couldn't have been busy cooking much of anything!  Seriously, these are staple ingredients.  I'm sure the Chinese fast food place in the next plaza wouldn't run out of the basics needed to make any fried rice. Since we had no other choice but to order sushi rolls, we did...the tnt and spicy tuna roll were ok.  Would not recommend this place."
8/23/2022,2,I had a very disappointing poke bowl.  The salmon and tuna did not taste fresh and most pieces had the silver skin still on. Toppings were lacking. The spicy pickled cucumbers were actually not pickled at all. The wonton strips taste like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They hardly gave me any avocado. I don't know if I'd eat this food again. There are much better options.
6/6/2022,5,"Really good sushi and bento offerings. Kids even enjoyed their boxes and were excited to try some sushi! Never eaten there before, but we WILL again!"
8/8/2022,5,Bento is my go to for sushi on a budget. It's consistently good food! They also have amazing boba and Thai tea
8/4/2021,5,This place was so good! And beautiful presentation of the very flavorful food. Very clean. Staff was friendly & helpful when trying to decide on what to order. I just wish I lived closer:(
1/25/2022,2,"Make sure you get some sort of rice with the protein. Do not get the vegetables ($2 upgrade) with the teriyaki bento bowl. I'm guessing the steam/moisture? Made it make my chicken teriyaki taste bad, rubbery, fatty.My bf got the teriyaki chicken too w rice and his bowl was good but he said the chicken used to be more charbroiled. He prefers charbroiled. He agreed mine tasted bad... when the only difference was vegetables. Place was clean and employees/manage were very helpful and pleasant."
1/3/2022,4,"I love the area around Armature Works. It is super family and pet friendly. There is great space to walk, jump on the Riverwalk, and people watch. But it is really nice to go into the historical site of Armature Works and grab a Bento box. Fresh Asian cuisine with little bits of different flavors all in one box. It has everything from your salad to your dessert in the handy little container. What a great idea, small amounts of everything you could want leading to 1 big meal. My Bento was teriyaki chicken, steamed rice, lo mein noodles, green beans, ginger salad, and to wrap up- a desert of sweet and crispy won tons. Not a bad gig. All good flavors and fresh. Service was quick. It's not a sit down - service place. Order at a window and when your beeper goes off, you pick it up. But they were fast and efficient. The building was hopping with a lot of people, but we still did not have to wait too long. Recommend giving them a try. The history of the building is quite cool, too. Spoiler alert- the building is old. LOL"
2/7/2022,4,The place was pretty good. I got the bento with beef. It was pretty good. Nice asian style drinks. Good atmosphere to hang out at.
11/23/2021,3,"Tried this spot after being out running errands. It was in a good location. The staff was courteous. I wanted the TNT roll but they were out of spicy tuna, so I got the hot lava instead. It did take about 20 for my food to come out, which seems like a long time since it was only like 3 people inside. The roll was worth the wait. It came out hot and the very tasty."
10/1/2020,3,"First time ordering from here.  Ordered through a meal delivery service.  Menu selection was decent with a pretty good description of each dish and its ingredients.I ordered the Garlic Broccoli Noodle bowl with Udon noodles, along with an order of Crunch Roll Sushi, and Veggie Spring Rolls.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a sushi fan but the Crunch Roll caught my attention.  It's a roll made up of Tuna, Krab Delite, Cream Cheese, Avacado, Eel Sauce, Spicy Mayo, and then Panko Fried.  The noodle bowl was really good and one that I would certainly get again.  The sushi roll was also good, although I would likely opt to try a different one next time.Food here was ok.  Definitely would order from here again."
3/20/2022,3,"For having experienced some pandemic related shortages while trying to order takeout here, the food is always acceptable & the service friendly."
5/26/2020,2,"Picked up dinner tonight At the 3rd St location. First off, the guy who gathered up our order was pushing his gloved hand thru his sweaty curly hair, then touching my food containers with the same hand. What happened to people with long hair wearing hair nets?When we got home they had mixed up our orders and had switched the base on them (rice vs ramen.) We didn't take it back; we were hungry. Given the lack of care tow cleanliness we will probably not go back anyway. So, after Jade's heartfelt response I decided to give it another try. I even tried to make it easy by ordering two of the same thing, except I didn't want mushrooms on one of them. Sure enough, neither one had mushrooms. As much as I dislike mushrooms, my husband loves them 10 times that. They weren't crowded, they just don't pay attention. I'm done."
2/19/2022,1,"This place was great... I used to go to the Bento in Gainesville when I was at UF so I was really excited about the St Pete location. When the St Pete location opened it was decent but has gone downhill so fast. The service takes forever and the prices have gotten completely outrageous. The quality of food has also gone down hill. Last time I was here 6 months ago I said it was the last time, but I was in a pinch with my family tonight and gave it one more try and it was a terrible experience. They were out of sushi rice, which was bummer because we came here for sushi. Then we had to order something else and it took 30+ min for the food to come out."
4/20/2022,2,"My oh my! Just take your money elsewhere. Walking up to it-pretty fresh and neat looking place. Walking in-sticky floors, cashier expecting you to order quickly as though you've been there before and know everything. The little plate of sushi wasn't worth the $11 or $14 (can't recall) I spent on it and the fried rice sesame chicken dish was just not that good either. It's almost midnight and I still can't get over the disappointment of spending $37+tip and the food was so not worth the money."
1/15/2020,3,"It was alright. Casual/fast food type of place. You order at the counter and they bring you the food.I ordered a tofu Korean rice bowl. It was ok. Flavor could have been better. It was a bit bland. Good portion sizes though. My sister had a poke bowl that she enjoyed. I've been to the locations in Gainesville as well, experiences there were just alright too.I can see how this would be popular for college students but for me it was just ok."
11/28/2019,4,"The Yellow Curry explosion I experienced with a good amount of chicken with noodles as a base was so goood and compared to the Red Curry, it wasn't nearly as spicy. For some reason when I drink, my heat tolerance is low, so the sweet coconut in the Yellow Curry was tastier to me at the moment, but both curries are outstanding. It did take +15 min. for the Red Curry to arrive at our table, so I think it could've been a shorter wait considering it wasn't busy on a Sat. afternoon. We got an order of Japanese Bagel sushi with their current promo - it's 4 pieces vs. traditional 8, but can't complain because it was free & included decent chunks of smoked salmon!I looove the modern interior design with red backsplash including the register area, which is a walk up counter (order + pay) & plenty of seating with great prices (def. would be a fantastic lunch spot if I worked in St. Pete)!"
7/3/2022,3,"The food is average. I've eaten here a lot and it's always usually the same. Not bad not great. Today I got the hot lava roll and it was super salty. I also got a bowl and it was salty, too much saucy. Just not great. I'm not sure if I'll be back. It's pretty average sushi and I'm not very impressed."
7/14/2021,3,"I've gone to Bento several times and the food is pretty good. Today I had the poke and it was tasty. My only complaint about it was the toppings could definitely be cut smaller, I've never had such big chucks of mango or cucumber in poke before. It makes it difficult to eat all mixed together with chopsticks but it's not that big of a deal. I also ordered the Bobo and that's where things went downhill. It's probably the worst boba I've ever had, most of my pieces were rock hard and hurt my jaw to chew. It's obvious they are not making fresh tapioca and it should definitely be advertised that way because for $4.50 I could get real boba."
9/9/2019,5,"Much like Bento, I am a product of the University of Florida and cut my teeth in majestic Gainesville, Florida. Bento was such a college mainstay for me that I was ecstatic when I heard they were opening in my hometown.If you've never been here before, don't expect extremely authentic cultural masterpieces or Michelin-starred cuisine. Bento does Pan-Asian fast casual and they do it well. The food here overall is fresher, less greasy, and a bit more elevated than the other Pan-Asian options we've had in Tampa Bay.I'm a big fan of the surf-and-turf don. The katsu is crispy and makes for such a nice texture against the tuna sashimi. It comes with a drizzle of their famous (and secretly recipe) spicy mayo and avocado pieces along with a side of wakame aka seaweed salad.Another must-get for me from Bento is the spicy cream chicken! Perfect mashup of spicy, creamy, and savory. Definitely not macro friendly but it's such a worthwhile splurge.I was also impressed with this Bento's store design. The lines are extremely clean and the restaurant is nice and airy, letting that famous St. Pete sunshine in. It actually reminds me a lot of the restaurants I saw on high streets backpacking through Seoul, Hong Kong, and Singapore.TL;DR: Bento does Americanized Pan-Asian food and does it really well. Get the surf-and-turf don or the spicy cream chicken. Restaurant itself is sleek and IG-worthy."
2/19/2022,3,Great food. Waited an hour for a simple order. It was annoying watching to go orders fly out while sitting and waiting.
2/14/2022,2,My wife and I came here for lunch and it was okay.  She got a sushi roll and I had a poke bowl and we split a couple of side.  There was not much flavor in anything.  I was amazed at how expensive this place is.  With tip we paid over $90 for a very mediocre lunch.
7/13/2021,4,"We ordered the Surf n Turf with Katsu and the Spicy Donburi with salmon in the late afternoon, and both came out so well, the tonkatsu was tossed on a little carelessly presentation-wise, but it still tasted great! The cucumber was so fresh and crunchy, and the salmon was so toro toro. The miso soup was also so good and warm, perfect for a rainy day, but we were a bit surprised when it came in a plastic container.I was a little thrown off by the name too, since for a restaurant named Bento, there was only one bento choice. In all honesty, I think they'd profit more if they advertised more for their bowls rather than bento haha! The workers were so nice, and the wait wasn't too long!It is also really clean and neat! I loved it!(also at the fountain, they have an own faucet for water instead of it being a tiny button under the lemonade category yknow what I mean? I love my water not getting mixed with lemonade)"
8/3/2020,2,"Got the general Tso bento box, side of lo mein, veggie spring rolls. Presentation was great but after you start getting into it, I'm not sure why I bought it. I don't really know what I was expecting but honestly tasted like a Panda Express. Like a Chinese restaurant in a strip mall but somehow not as good? The general Tso sauce was salty and it was more like a soup than a sauce. I liked the idea of having a salad but that also was drown in peanut sauce dressing. The lo mein was greasy, the rice was dry. The deep fried sugar dumpling triangles were pretty good and so were the spring rolls. Would try again but I think I would skip bento box or anything that that comes at your neighborhood Chinese place. Idono, I just think if your calling yourself bento box, that should be the star of the show."
2/10/2022,4,Staff was amazing and food was so good. First time going will definitely return. Weird it's by a Publix but who cares it's still good
10/3/2020,5,So delicious!!!! Everything fresh!!! Cooked perfectly!! Nice portion! Ordered thru Uber eats! Food arrived hot! Love this place...
7/25/2021,1,"My friend and I were so excited about trying something new. This place totally disappointed us. The food taste like Asian food from the mall. Well...to be honest mall food taste a lot better than this place. The prices was extremely high for the quality of food. The food was cold, over cooked and lifeless. It was exciting to eat from a bento box and use chopsticks but that was the ONLY excitement. Don't waste your money here. I spent $25 for a Bento Box meal and added an egg roll. I wish I could get a refund. Never going again."
9/8/2020,4,"This is the 5th bento location I have ordered from in FL. The first time I ordered they forgot my boba tea and sauces, even though they charged me for them. From looking at the other reviews, it seems like this particular location has a hard time fulfilling orders so I would recommend always double checking your bag if you are picking up. The second time everything was great and the food was fresh.I recommend trying the sriracha garlic chicken bowl with lo mein, as well as the rainbow and mt fuji rolls.I do not recommend the pad thai."
10/30/2021,1,"After sitting on the order for 30 mins each time, You've canceled my order 3 times in a row via delivery service, over just a month. Get off the app if you don't want to use the delivery service. Horrible. I used to be a regular."
5/27/2021,3,"The food would have been great, if it was warm..I came in here with my family the other night. We ordered a good amount of food, including:-A noodle bowl teriyaki style with chicken-a chicken and rice bowl -miso soups-snow peas The soup was very good. It was very warm with little squares of tofu and mushroom in it. The broth was mild, but rich enough for the Happy Hour special they were having. The happy hour meant that you could get a free side if you ordered between a certain time. The noodles and chicken were both lukewarm at best. I question if they ever went into a wok or some sort of heating apparatus at all. The chicken was very good! It was tender, and had skin on giving a very authentic feel. However, it was also room temperature. I even dug around my bowl a little, thinking that I'd find some hot noodles in the center just to taste. Nothing. The whole bowl was just room temperature. Had this been takeout, I would have chalked the lack of warmth to the fact that I had to drive home. This wasn't the case. I ate these noodles In the Store in their lovely big bowls. Heat can really change flavor profile, and it tasted subpar without any kind of physical warmth. For the money we paid, I really wish it had been at least mildly hot... I won't be back."
3/6/2020,4,"I received a gift card after my last review and used that today. I ordered the same thing as last time I was there and my take out food wasn't very good. This meal I decided to dine in. All the food was hot and fresh, I was in around noon. However they didn't listen to my order and my food was on rice and missing the red peppers. I ordered it without green peppers, I still wanted the red. Decent price for fresh made food."
11/1/2018,3,"It is a fast food joint. Order and paid at counter. Nothing fancy. Just like mall food. Except more personal touch with cooking after order. Seem like fried rice and noodle being pre-cook for assembly. I hope for Bento to be here at Bay Area and now they are here which has not impress me. The best thing about this place is their bento box with many items and reasonable price. I would come back lack of time to eat but not for date night. We got the Korean beef and the Katsu bento box. The Korean beef did not fare well. But the katsu is good. The string beans has no salt in the bento box. We also got the spicy tuna small with 4 pieces. This item is a bit expensive. However, it has good flavor. We got the boba tea which is fun to have. Something I don't understand is when you paid and order at counter, the alway have a tip box to check for 18% to 20%. The only service is bring the food on table. That always doesn't make sense for cafeteria type food service industry."
10/6/2018,4,"Very good and brand spanking new. Bento Cafe is a Florida chain and I see they like to be close to college towns. I've been to a Bento Cafe years ago in Gainesville and I was excited to see an opening here.They have bowls with noodles, rice, veggies, they have bento boxes with sushi rolls or other rice and noodle options with beef, steak, and chicken. They have sides like egg rolls, dumplings, Wakame salad, and crab Rangoon. There r definitely options for meat eaters and veggie eaters. Prices r a step lower than usual which is nice probably bc it's close to USF St. Pete.They also have boba drinks too!Free parking for an with validation is available. Parking lot on 2nd street. They also have about 6-8 outside tables - dog friendly after you are coming back from the Farmers Market!"
4/28/2022,5,Ordered sushi for delivery and it was delicious! I got the florida roll and the spicy tuna roll! I would recommend this place! The only thing they forgot in our Togo order was missing chop sticks. All in all good experience and great food!
10/7/2018,5,"I'm a fan. Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi (Bento Café on FB) is a smaller chain of restaurants based in Florida, currently consisting of ten locations. Don't let the word ""chain"" prevent you from dining here. We were pleasantly surprised with our recent visit. After we placed our menu choices with the cashier, the whole order process was quick and efficient. The wait for our meal was minimal. We started with the Pork Egg Rolls and then chose the Mongolian Beef Bento Box and the Japanese Curry Katsu Noodle Bowl as our entrées. Everything was delicious and the generous portions were a great value.There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating available and the staff was pleasant to deal with. As with most DTSP restaurants and bars, street parking is minimal. Patrons can park in the attached Camden Pier Garage for a limited time. We are placing this restaurant in our repertoire and will be back to try more items on their menu."
10/1/2018,5,"Gainesville, Jacksonville, Orlando, Davie... and now FINALLY St. Petersburg!Bento Cafe has finally landed in the Tampa/DTSP area.  Located on Third  Street South, Bento serves cooked foods and sushi in a fast casual setting.  You order your food with the cashier, get a number, grab your seat, and a server brings your food right to your table.  You can place an order to-go if you're on the move.  You can also call ahead and place an order for pickup.I've been eating Bento since my college days in UF.  It's nice to see them taking over Florida and never losing their quality taste or quick service.I ordered my usual build-your-own poke bowl.  They have 3 sizes: mini, regular, and large.  The regular has 2 proteins + 1 base (white rice, brown rice, or greens) + 4 mix-ins + 2 toppings.  For $11, you get a good sized portion of ingredients made to your specific liking.I also ordered a boba milk tea, which is just average in my opinion.  It is now one of the few places in DTSP where you can order boba tea quickly to-go.There is indoor and outdoor seating.  Although it was just a soft open, the servers were quick to clean vacated tables so new customers could sit right away.  I imagine that during peak hours, it will get crowded quickly.If you are craving some good pan-Asian cuisine, definitely check out Bento Cafe."
9/17/2021,2,"The sushi here was among the worst I've ever had. The rolls fell apart as I ate them, the rice was cold, and the rolls without sauce tasted like supermarket sushi. The worst part, though, is that the rice was undercooked and semi-chewy/semi-crunchy. It was mostly inedible. Maybe the noodle dishes are more palatable, but stay away from the sushi!The other reviews saying it tasted like mall or fast food restaurants are spot on. I won't be back."
3/6/2019,5,"I love love love the amount of choices this place has for our picking! For my first time I tried the Bento Box with sesame soy chicken! The bento box included rice, lo mein, a ginger salad and some little wonton triangles. Super good and very filling! We got spring rolls to share - 3 per order which is different than most places that have 4. But none the less - very good! My boyfriend got a orange chicken noodle bowl and a flying dragon roll. We were both stuffed to a brim but not enough to not drink our boba teas!For the boba we tried a mix for each of us. One milk tea chocolate taro mix and a pineapple mango blended ice tea! Both were great and gave us a sugar buzz for sure.Overall this place is great and I will be returning! I and excited to try out other options they offer"
10/3/2019,5,"It's always a treat when I eat at Bento. As a recent UF grad, I'm much more familiar with the Archer and Newberry Rd locations in Gainesville. Today I stopped in and grabbed a Red Dragon roll for lunch and added eel sauce to it. If I'm being honest, I looked up the contents of a roll I often pick up from a different sushi restaurant and found the closest thing on Bento's menu. It was good! There was a bit of a wait for my takeout order, but it was peak lunch time so it was to be expected. I usually get pao pao chicken bowls or poke bowls from here. I've had their ginger salad before too. All are fair game. Love Bento!"
10/27/2020,2,"This Bento is so hit or miss it is painful to make a visit here. When this location first opened I went once a week. They had great happy hour specials and the food always came out within 10 minutes. I am not sure what has happened but ever since Covid began they ended happy hour specials  and their food quality, speed of service, and customer service has all greatly declined. I stopped going because one time my chicken stir fry took 30 minutes to make. When I asked the rep what happened she gave me a very short answer and did not even apologize for my wait. Then last week I received some coupons in the mail and decided to try it again. To my disappointment I quickly found out nothing has gotten better. Even though it only took 22 minutes for my order to come out the quality was terrible. I got the chicken stir fry bento box. There was barely any chicken, the rice was hard, the salad was soaked in dressing, the green beans were soggy, and the noodles were Tasteless. I understand covid precautions take precedent and I don't mind waiting a little bit longer now a days and I understand they need to make up the money they lost but eliminating happy hour but it doesn't mean quality and customer service need to suffer. I really do enjoy Bento and their crab wontons are the best in town but I don't believe I can continue to go back to this location until they start to make their customers a priority."
10/13/2018,5,"This newly opened (Oct 2018) quick/casual restaurant just opened under the retail space in Camden Pier District's retail space. The space is modern, clean and conveniently located. Service was fantastic and all the employees were super friendly and willing to accommodate. They have many vegan and vegetarian options and are very open and transparent about their menu. I wanted nigiri and sashimi but it wasn't listed on their menu, so I asked about it and they showed me a ""secret menu"" where they had their options listed. It came about 7 minutes after we ordered which was super quick!  The quality of my smoked salmon and eel nigiri was fantastic and it was very fresh. My friends ordered the chicken pad Thai and chicken with udon noodles. They both raved about their meals. I would definitely come back here again and I love how versatile the menu is."
11/8/2021,3,"The place looked clean and although it was empty, the staff was very busy.  It seems like they were filling many take out orders.  It took a very long time to get a simple order of sushi.  Other than the wait it was a decent experience."
7/2/2021,1,When did COMMON SENSE go out the window. We used to love Bentos now this is what they serve because they are out of ingredients they could easily get at the Publix next door. Sad to see. You just lost 2 long time customers. Good Luck!
4/21/2021,2,"I used to love bento so much and worked there when they only had like 2 locations. Since then I've been disappointed as the quality of their food seemed have an inverse relationship with their growth. They used to have a good portion of the side of beans that come along with their bowls and now they put 3 as a garnish. The price has increased as well with smaller meat and veggie portions so it doesn't make sense. I ordered a matcha milk tea and found several crumbs of what I think is burned boba mixed in, making the drink inedible. I've given it a shot time and time again but this may be my last visit."
11/13/2019,4,"Updated review on 11-13-2019: Because I found the food so good at Bento, I've now revisited another 6 or so times. Food is still excellent and a very good value, and the staff have been fine. I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars (up from 3). Consistency could still be better, and the staff could still be 'happier' and more engaging, but overall I love eating here.Original review:Food was excellent (yellow curry lo mein bowl and pork dumplings), but the counter girl/order taker was terrible-arms folded, leaning on counter, and a look of total displeasure at having to be at work. And she mumbled and I had to ask her repeatedly to repeat what she was asking. This was so off putting that I deduced 2 stars. Hopefully it was just this one employee."
6/18/2021,2,I understand restaurants are struggling so I recommend you order ahead of time. It looked like they had a decent amount of staff but It took a half hour to get my order. I only got a small salad and the cucumbers were bad. Won't stop me from going back because i like the food but I will definitely order ahead. Just hope they will get back to having better service.
6/17/2019,4,"The place was nice and clean, cashier and waiter were friendly, the food was good but just a few things about my order left me slightly bummed. First off, you can order an entree from their ""From The Kitchen"" section or ""Sushi/Build-Your-Poke Bowl"" section. ""From the Kitchen"" section give you few types of bases: Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or their Bento Box. They have a Kids Bowl option too, so extra points for that! For their ""Sushi"" section, they have a huge variety of signature rolls and some poke bowls. I ordered their bento box because I felt given their name, the bento box would be the star of the show. However, I'm not sure if it was just my order, but they could've honestly improved it. I ordered the Pao Pao Spicy Cream as my entree selection. With this entree, you have an option to choose if you wanted Pao Pao Spicy Cream with either chicken, tofu, or shrimp. I chose the shrimp and these are honestly to die for! Their sauce is amazing and so delicious. It's almost like a honey walnut sauce but spicy. While the main entree was great, the sides were a little disappointing. The salad I had was drenched in their ginger salad dressing which tasted a little bit too salty for my liking. Also, because it was a lot of dressing, it really made the greens soggy. The dressing was just too watery. Also, I was not a fan of their Lo Mein noodles. It was cooked in a potent type of oil or sauce (maybe too much sesame oil?) that just did not tasted appealing. The rest of the sides on the bento box such as the green beans, the white rice, and fried wontons with a white sauce (I'm assuming it's condensed milk), were all cooked perfectly and tasty! Ohh and try out their Krab Wontons- it was really crispy and yummy! Overall, still a good place to try out! I would still go back to try out the other foods on the menu but because it was my first time time here, I wished my order could've been better."
1/13/2022,3,Love the food here but they ALWAYS give different portions sizes. sometimes i will order double meat and it comes out to a smaller portion than if i just ordered a regular portion. ALSO. don't expect to get your food quickly. i ordered to go food on my food and waited 20 minutes before coming inside to pick it up. when i got inside the lady at the counter told me my ticket JUST came through and it will be another 20 minutes. doesn't make sense to me why the machine doesn't print my ticket for 20 minutes after my order was placed.
6/5/2021,5,Amazing delivery - everything was fresh& tasted amazing! I got a poke bowl and my boyfriend ordered the Schezuapn spicy bowl - both great plus the dumplings and spring rolls we shared. Will definitely order again!
11/7/2021,2,The dinners we ordered were okay but the staff were overwhelmed with the number of orders and were way behind schedule. My order was supposed to be ready in a half after after ordering but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes at the restaurant because the order was not completed. This is not the first time we (and our hungry toddler) have had to wait--Just beware that pickups around 6-7:30 often run late.
12/30/2020,2,"Unfortunately I have to update my latest review. I ordered the poke bowl with chilled sesame noodles. The noodles were drenched in a congealed sauce, it was so thick it layered the bottom of the bowl. I'm actually kinda worried they were really old, and I'm gonna get sick."
6/26/2021,5,"I bumped up my rating, manager reached out to me. I think that shows seriousness and appreciated it.Food tastes great but way overpriced and super slow. Ordered katsu rice bowl and a sushi roll. There was one other table in restaurant. I feel the issue is they get a lot of take out orders and like many places, tend to devote their time to serving mobile requests and not the customers in the store. Plus spent almost $30 for a rice bowl and sushi roll. Little crazy. Rice bowl came out first. The roll took almost 20 mins more. Very disappointed."
8/25/2020,1,First time ordering online lunch for pick up The website promises a 15% discount for first time online orderCompany did. Not give the discount at check out even after using the code as suggested Very unethical in my opinion to bait and switch
2/27/2019,4,My perfect curry. O how I've searched for thee! The Japanese Curry is a brown savory curry with umami out the wazoo and has just a bit of a kick to get your sinuses buzzing. Even though I was full I wanted to order more rice so I could soak up every last drop. It's a little salty but the jasmine rice balances it out well and I don't know if I'll ever order anything else because I know nothing can compare.
5/14/2019,5,It was so goodA little pricey but worth it. We tried 2 different things and are looking forward to going again!
3/24/2019,4,"Bento is a great spot throughout Florida for a quick pan-Asian bite! Their menu selection is pretty inclusive of typical meals like pad thai, katsu, udon, rice bowls, bento boxes, etc.  Depending on time of day, this place can be pretty busy!  Don't get caught parking in the Publix parking lot or you could get towed.Value - priced well. You get a good amount of food in the bowls and a good variety in the bento box to make it worth.My recommends - Pineapple fried rice, Spicy Cream chicken/tofu/shrimp...now called Pao Pao, pad thai, and curry katsu!  If you want something a bit more fresh I would recommend the Chirashi bowl!  The service is typically great and quick!"
11/18/2021,4,My boyfriend and I used to order from Bento basically weekly to get poke bowls and he still loves it but i'm so sad I can't find your teriyaki steak on your menu anymore! Please bring it back!
4/8/2019,4,"I have a love for poke bowls so I had to try out Bento! I ordered my bowl, it came out perfect. I was there for lunch and got a mini, which was a perfect size for me to be full but not overstuffed. Everything was fresh and delicious. I am a huge fan of the size into OK no because as I said the mini was perfect size and with tax around 7.50, I love pacific counter which is also downtown but the bowls are way too big and this way I save money and don't waste food, not to mention the fish seemed more fresh and the sauce options were better here. I'll definitely be back. I chose 4/5 because the service was a little iffy/rude, if it was just based on food I would have chosen 5/5."
6/9/2021,5,Wonderful and convenient place to get a quick lunch. Right downtown with ink walking distance. Food was excellent staff even better.
11/8/2021,5,"I have never been to Bento before however just having moved to the area I was excited to try it. We ordered sushi, apps and 4 meals. The food was delicious and I was so impressed with the service. However, I did have a couple issues with my order at first. The red headed Manager, I believe her name is Ashley, couldn't have been nicer and more willing to help correct it. She was super friendly and understanding and turned an inconvenience into a pleasurable experience. I was quite impressed with the customer service. Great service and great food!"
3/17/2021,2,"My family and I went here for lunch and it was not great...at all. It was our first (and last) time ever. Shortly after arriving, (again first timers) we asked an employee a question which was rudely (and quickly) answered that they couldn't help us and to ask the cashier. They have an extremely abbreviated menu (which we could deal with given the pandemic and has no impact on the rating) but $96 dollars later, my bf was served his General Tso's chicken and shrimp way under cooked. It actually made him physically ill! Not happening again!"
11/8/2018,5,"I first had Bentos when I was in college in Gainesville,FL.   Over the years I've had a chance to also try their Jacksonville and Orlando locations.   I am so excited that we now have one of our own locations in St.Pete.It's located right next to the Simple Greek and is very close the All Children's Hospital.  The ambiance is nice for this type of restaurant and it is very clean.   I usually get their bento box and change up the main dish frequently so I get a variety of flavors. However,  they have so many more options as well.  There is some street parking right in front. Overall,  their quality and consistency of food compared to all their locations is great. I love when a franchise can keep the same standards at every restaurant. I will continue to recommend this place for anyone that wants a relatively quick bite to eat and will be coming back often!!!"
11/26/2018,4,"Quick, delicious option in downtown St. Pete. I stopped in for a bento box that came with chicken, rice, noodles, ginger salad and crispy wonton dessert. Everything in the box was great. I also ordered garlic edamame, which I would not order again. I was hoping the Garlic edamame would be a saucy garlic edamame but it was just edamame tossed in minced garlic. At that point, I prefer soy sauce and salt. I ordered a boba and was shocked to learn their teas were sweetened so I sent it back and returned it for a Thai tea."
11/9/2018,4,Nice open space with outside seating. Grab a menu as you walk in to pick your order. Lots of really good choices!  Even though I love tonkatsu I opted for the pineapple Thai fried rice.  The chicken had a nice flavor and was very tender but it was just ok. Got some pork egg rolls as well. I liked these a lot. They were not as heavily breaded as some I have had. Overall nothing really wow'd me but it was not bad by any means.
1/7/2019,4,"Stopped in here for lunch today - if you can find parking it's definitely a nice place to stop in while on a lunch break. That was our biggest problem, finding parking. We ended up in the Publix lot next door after circling around it for about 10 mins. Beforehand we were circling the blocks at least 3 times with no luck on street parking. Once we got parked & made it to the restaurant, we saw a sign saying free 1 hour parking in the garage behind them, but it was such a tiny print that anyone from the road wouldn't've seen it. As for the food, some of the freshest fast food seafood I've had. My boyfriend got a spicy tuna roll & I had a mini custom poke bowl also with tuna; both were super tasty, but the roll was smaller than what we get at other places like Rollbotto and Locale. We also split a Terriyaki pork noodle bowl & it was incredibly tasty! It was also quite a big portion, so if ordering it I'd suggest splitting it with someone or making sure you're going in quite hungry. The waitstaff was all super nice too and very welcoming. It was nice and modern inside, cleaned well, & there was outdoor seating too which we'll probably take advantage of next time. So if you can find parking, by all means check out this new place downtown!"
10/25/2018,5,"Finally Bento comes to St. Pete! What an amazing location.I had the pleasure of joining in on the Open Media Night  and oh my was it a blast! Their sushi was just so vibrant and the atmosphere is amazing. The place is cool, the food is AMAZING every bite was better then the last.Great place for lunch in the area. Their options vary from bentos, to sushi, to build your own poke, amazing appetizers and boba! Come check it out for yourself!"
10/25/2018,5,"Bento did a great job on meeting my expectation just as much as the original place where they first opened in Gainesville. I bragged to my friend how their food is good quality. She was hesitant to try the food, but she was impressed with the taste, price, and what's even better is the convenience to the location close by to her job . The chicken teriyaki was tasty, the portions was perfect. She had to take some home because she wasn't able to finish it. My orange chicken wasn't dry. I shall meet up with her again future lunches."
10/5/2018,5,"This is our 4th time eating here in the two weeks it has been open and we love it. Bento is still in soft opening but they are doing an amazing job to serve great pan-Asian fast casual food. Thank you for coming to downtown St. Pete!We are vegetarians and they have a great tofu selection on almost every dish. The fried rice, the tofu bento box, the pad Thai have all been great. Our friends have all said they love it as well. The atmosphere is casual and modern, the service is friendly and the prices are very reasonable. We love Bento!"
11/16/2018,5,"I really liked the Japanese Curry Katsu with pork on Lo Mein Noodles. There is a lot of meat that comes with the order. There could be more noodles and less meat in my opinion, but it will fill you up. I didn't finish the meal the three times I ordered it. I ate there at lunch. Then I went back to get To Go at dinner. Then my friend picked it up for me the next time before we left town. I had it two days in a row. I did order extra gravy the third time since I love to soak it all in curry and there wasn't as much in the To Go order as when I ate there. I wish there was a location close to where I live. The strawberry ice drink I had was really good. The thai tea was just ok. I really recommend the place. The price is decent too. The employees are nice."
11/15/2018,5,"The sushi and bento boxes here are excellent. This is my go-to spot for Uber Eats, too. The staff is friendly and you can tell they genuinely are enjoying their new spot in St. Pete!"
9/18/2019,5,"I originally found this place returning home from a road trip in Gainesville. My college roommates were from Jacksonville and talked non stop about it so I had to try it. Between locations, they are very consistent. Although I remember them having more options in Gainesville, especially when it comes to boba, the food is delicious. The restaurants are always clean and have plenty of space. This location has parking in the garage but you do need to ask for a parking pass before you walk out of the restaurant or it is $5 to get out of the garage. There are also a few spaces on the street that are parallel.When you first walk in, they have plenty of menus to look at (the menu is not on the wall.) The staff is also quick to greet and help and check you out. They offer plenty of sushi, build-a-poke bowls and various rice and noodle combinations. My favorite is to ask for a bento box. It typically comes with a protein, white or brown rice, ginger salad, lo mein and string beans. I have also had a poke bowl from here. They allow you to personalize it and they it laid out on the menu to make it easier to order.  They have plently of protein options and do also offer tofu as a selection. One time I was there, they were out of it, but every other time I have gone, they have had all proteins. The sushi is good and usually is served as 4 or 8 pieces. I wouldn't personally recommend getting the boba. It is okay, but seems to be pre-made. Everything I have gotten has been fresh, hot and worth the price. They also have quite a few sauces to choose from but you do have to ask, they will not just give them to you.There are typically chopsticks on the table and the plastic silverware is closer to the drink station.They have two nice single use bathrooms inside the restaurant towards the back of the restaurant. They also allow dogs on the patio. Seating is first-come, first-serve."
2/18/2021,5,Great quality sushi! Loveeeee that the straws were paper. I very much so support limiting plastic. Can't wait to try other dishes.
12/6/2019,1,"Prior to going to this restaurant, we studied the menu online and decided it sounded like it would have vegan options. When it came time to order at the counter my husband asked what exactly was in the Veggie Spring rolls. The girl at the counter said ""I don't know. Lettuce and and some vegetables? I don't eat that kind of stuff."" Alllrighty then. My husband said he was interested in the Garlic Broccoli but asked if she knows if it is vegan. She looked confused. So, she turned to the girl expediting orders and echoed his question. She said ""I don't even know what you're asking."" The girl expediting asked his question to another girl on the line in the kitchen. She was very exasperated and said ""No. None of our stuff here is vegan."" On that note, we turned around and left. But, I couldn't help but wonder what on earth they put on their edamame that made it NON-vegan. Lol!They clearly did not care and have no idea what goes into the food they are preparing. We went next door to Simply Greek. The staff at Simply Greek were  super friendly and provided a healthy dinner."
1/4/2021,2,"It's not that the food is bad, it's just never correct. My first visit there was no boba in my boba tea, I thought I had ordered wrong so I didnt think much of it. Today they atleast informed me that they were put of boba for the tea. I ordered a bowl that didnt have bell pepper listed on the menu because I cant stand them... my bowl was supposed to have string beans in it. I get home, no string beans and but it did have red bell pepper. Twice a disappointment. After I picked out all the nastiness it dorsnt taste bad... just not what I ordered."
6/13/2020,2,"I have been a fan until the shutdown.  My first visit back to the St. Pete location on June 7th was terrible. The sushi chefs were different, sushi rice was dry, fish was not fresh, the rolls were tiny and overall very old and cheap and dry. .I also ordered the Mongolian beef and the white rice had a burnt flavor. I ended up up making a quick Uncle Ben's at home. The egg roll also was burnt. The fried crust was literally burnt. Dumplings have been okay in the past, but even these didn't taste right.  Very disappointing and I will not eat there again. I live 2 blocks away. This was a bi-weekly treat that I will not waste my paycheck on anymore.Bye Bento"
1/6/2021,2,"I ordered 2 bento boxes for pickup(currently doing only pickup and delivery).  Neither one came with the side sauce and I even paid for an extra sauce. Of course it's pickup and delivery so it's not like you can somehow get your sauce .  I won't be ordering from here again., such a disappointment. Everyone wants you to cut them a break since COVID19. Why? Just do your job."
3/17/2020,4,"Decently priced, but the bowl lacked flavor. Even with sauce, I was missing something. The interior is really nice, service was mediocre."
3/28/2021,2,Loved Bento near UCF in school and recently moved to St. Pete and was so excited since I've missed Bento so much. Tried ordering for pickup on a Sunday night around 7:00 and their online ordering was down. No problem decided to give them a call and order over the phone. Well low and behold I have been on the call for about 15 minutes now and nobody has answered. I've triple checked their hours and confirmed that they are open. Such a shame because I know how good the Orlando Bento is.
12/13/2020,1,Nasty female manager. They're out of noodles for the bento box and would only substitute a lower cost item because it would be too much trouble for them to substitute a different type of noodle. Other locations have decent staff but not here.
10/1/2019,5,I started at the original in Gainesville and the expanded locations keep up the quality. The Spicy Cream Chicken is my go to meal and it hits the spot every time. My wife got sushi on this visit and it was delicious as always. If you want a big step up in quality over your typical Chinese / Japanese take out definitely go to Bento!!
12/8/2020,1,"Awful service, I would not recommend going to this place. After placing my order 30 minutes earlier online, I get there at the scheduled pick up time. I don't like to wait around restaurants during COVID-19. I order ahead, and I am in and out quick. However, when I requested my order is when they started to work on my order. So why did I order ahead? I tipped ahead online, and then after waiting 10-15 minutes for the food to be ready, I requested my tip be refunded as I didn't see the service meet the expectations. They said they couldn't do that now, and I'd have to wait an undetermined amount of time later."
12/7/2019,4,"Sushi Combo Box  with spicy mex,  fried avo, and Cali. Tasty and fresh!  Service just ok. Not a fan of the cali but the rest was good."
8/4/2019,3,"The food was good and the restaura Tnt desing was net, but front staft were not very nice with new customers. They were not friendly suggesting plates or answering questions."
9/19/2020,5,"I was asked by a co-worker to pick a place and meal I wanted for my send off from an 11.5yr work tenure. It was a hard choice but since I'm no longer living and now working in downtown st.pete I had to choose Bento! Since we were all stuck at work they used Uber eats to order for delivery online. I REALLY wanted the fried tofu I first tried in what I believe was teriyaki sauce or something sweet and savory. But the only option for fried was the pokè bowls. I really wanted a Bento box. I chose the Mongolian Box with shrimp and white rice. I read some negative reviews for the ginger salad. I know ginger can be an acquired taste and pickled ginger depends on the way it's pickled. I personally love ginger and have been greatly disappointed with bought pickled jars and restaurants meals with ginger. I would have to disagree with the negative reviews for the salad here. My negative would be, I wish the salad was full sized cause I loved it and it was a basic salad. The ginger made all the difference. The whole meal was delicious. I hate to say I have a small negative but the lo mein wasn't as good as I've had at hole in the walls. Maybe it wasn't drenched in grease or drenched in oil to give that savory flavor. I added teriyaki sauce to it and it was edible. That would be maybe half a star negative from the review since the fried tofu is what originally sold me. Everything else was top notch. I also had the veggie spring rolls which were also very tasty. I was very satisfied with my meal but I hope my next and future experiences are with the fried tofu that I fell in love with and mouth water over."
7/10/2021,2,I went to get some boba & food. No one told me till they handed me my drink with a paper straw & spoon that they ran out of boba straws. I wish someone could've at least told me before. How am I supposed to enjoy my drink with a tiny paper straw & spoon. So unprofessional.
7/17/2019,2,"Not as good as I had hoped. Upon arrival, the first thing that I noticed was a dirty bowl at the counter where they had stacks of ""clean"" bowls. I told the counter person and it was promptly removed. Then when I had my order brought to me, I thought it looked great. Only after the first bite did I realize that they had not removed the tails from the shrimp. Yuck! And I felt that the rice was cold. Overall, not impressed with portion size compared to price."
11/6/2020,1,"We were the only people in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes for us to get our order. They kept putting to go orders on the shelf but had no priority for us, who were sitting there waiting. Mind you, we only ordered two things: 1 bento box and 1 poke bowl. After 30 minutes goes by, I had drank my whole large boba tea and my food finally came out, only for half my toppings on my poke bowl to be missing. They did not offer any compensation for our time or their error besides a half apology. We will not be returning to any Bento Box."
12/20/2020,2,"Poor service all around. I ordered delivery online. My order was assigned to DoorDash. Time was 60 minutes, order to arrive by 7:15 pm. I checked status at 7:25 and it still just said received. I called Bento. He said ""it's here"" so I ask about DoorDash and what's up? His reply was ""I don't know, I've never ordered from us online."" Seriously? So I hang up and call DoorDash. That guy tells me they don't have any active dashers and it could be 45 more minutes. What?!  I call Bento back to inform them we are coming to PICK UP our DELIVERY order that is now 20 minutes late that we've waited over an hour for because they assigned it to a delivery service that has no drivers.  His answer, ""ok, it's here.""  Wow.  Just wow.  Food was average.  And cold."
3/1/2019,2,"I'm struggling about whether to give this two or three stars. I think I will focus on the food and therefore give it 2 stars.   The people were very nice and the place is clean and they cook fast. First time visiting. I got the bento box to go.   The lo mein noodles were covered in oil, I couldn't finish them they were so oily.  They were good noodles though, nice n firm and well cooked.  The green beans were old and cold and were a very tiny portion.  They were also greasy.  I was looking forward to the green beans as the healthy portion of the meal but it was about 1 table spoon of green beans. The salad was wilted and had so much dressing on it that it was like a half a centimeter of liquid at the bottom of that partition. And the dressing tasted terrible, really terrible, it was just SO SALTY and that was the only note.  it didn't have any of the fresh essence of good Thai carrot ginger dressings.  I couldn't eat the salad it was so bad.  It tasted like it's 1/2 soy sauce.  Ok... you get the idea!The little desert wonton with condensed milk was yummy and a super cute idea. Brown Rice was cooked just right.Unfortunately the main dish was absolutely drenched in orange sauce-- I mean like again a pool of it at the bottom that was totally unnecessary and overwhelming.  If I had to estimate I would say they took my one portion of chicken and poured about half a cup of sauce into it.  Thankfully it was a tasty sauce.  I will probably order it again and ask for light sauce.  I ordered it with the no-batter chicken, and that is definitely worth it because it was good white meat chicken.All in all it comes out as a fast food level execution because of the temperature and sauce and oil and dressing issues.  It could be so much better if they just control the cook's heavy hand.Staff was great."
5/26/2021,1,I've been coming to this place since they opened. The menu is less and less interesting. I waited 20 min today for a simple order. By then a disinterested employee told me they had many online orders so maybe another 10-15 minutes. I left and I will not return.
5/22/2021,5,"I enjoyed the Japanese Bagel sushi roll, Korean Rice Bowl, and Orange Noodle Bowl (though I added my own spices to those last two). Certainly worth an UberEats craving order!"
8/16/2020,3,I come to bento occasionally and it's always been consistent food quality! As we know it's typically a walk up service but during COVID things have change. Understandable so. So now walk up orders are taking 28 mins I guess and counting to be fulfilled awhile we stand here. It's just a bowl! For a normally walk up to order restaurant their neighborhood clients that walk up spend more time waiting then they ever did! It's now 35 mins still waiting. Luckily they told just me what the issue was. So I'll continue to wait bc that's all you can do. Total wait time - 37 mins
2/7/2019,1,"So after 1 month since my review, they finally commented here asking me to e-mail so they can "" Fix it"".   I e-mailed them 3 days ago but I have not heard yet.  Though I totally agree if you comment like that, maybe people think this restaurant cares about their customers BUT NOT.  Oh well... if anyone ask me if I know any good Asian restaurants around, this place is on my NO-GO list. As an Asian I get that question often by the way"
4/24/2020,2,Ordered take out via grub hub for shrimp wok fried  rice and sushi. Picked up the order and opened the box to find chicken wok fried rice. Chicken is my least favorite protein hence why I ordered shrimp. Did not take it back due it was raining hard and i was read to eat something even if it was wrong. Not sure if the failure is on grub hub or the restaurant. Still will probably deter me from returning.
7/10/2020,5,"Excellent food, very tasty, reasonably priced... and they're watching out for our health by providing truly sanitary contactless delivery!!"
4/28/2020,5,You can't go wrong. My favorite is the beef with lo mein noodles and veggies and the poke bowls are to die for. Oh and did I mention the sushi! Yum
12/28/2018,4,"A colleague and I tried this place out for lunch the other day.  It is quick serve, order at the counter bowls and sushi.  They had lo mein bowls with lots of Chinese standards for topping; Pao Pao, General Tso's, etc.  Poke bowls with two proteins and lots of topping choices.  Brown rice alternative for all dishes available, didn't notice an upcharge.  Sushi rolls, many with krab.  It was clean and tasted fresh.  A good amount of food for price paid.  I would do lunch again or a bowl for dinner on the run.  Enjoy!"
10/20/2018,5,"Honestly, I went to the CVS across this place and after I was done decided to have a late lunch at Bento. The symbol looked somewhat familiar and after reading the reviews I remember the ones I had been to in Gainesville and Orlando. Nice to see it here in St Pete. The menu is quite extensive. You can choose stir fry, poke bowl, sushi or a Bento box. I wanted to try their poke bowl. It had 3 sizes: mini, regular, large. I chose the regular. You get up to 2 proteins (I chose tuna), up to 2 bases (I chose brown rice and greens), up to 4 toppers (I chose edamame, avocado, wakame and asparagus) and you get to choose 2 sauces (I chose ginger dressing and poke soy which is basic garlic sesame soy). You need to order your dish at the counter and take a number. The food arrived within about 5 minutes. Really nice size with the dressings on the side. It tasted really good. Wasn't too excited about the brown rice but it blended well with the dish. The people that worked there were all nice and worked well together. Glad we have a Bento Cafe now in St Pete."

10/16/2018,5,"I worked at the Gainesville location in college for two years and I still crave it to this day. The amount of excitement I felt when they finally opened the St. Pete location was beyond wordsSome 10/10 favorites would be the red curry katsu rice bowl, the bulgogi noodle bowl (sub udon), and the mt Fuji roll. Do yourself a favor and support this great company!"
1/11/2019,5,I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this place on bitesquad ! I love bento box anything and oh my goodness this place does not disappoint! They give you so much food for what you pay for and that really says a lot about a restaurant. It was so good I ordered 3 days in a row  the only thing I would say is the Thai tea tastes like the powdered Thai tea but the boba pearls were perfect !!
4/6/2020,2,"I just received my order via Uber Eats. I ordered orange chicken and tofu with curry sauce. I received 1) sweet and sour coated chicken and 2) chicken with curry sauce. Dish 1) is so sweet that it's inedible. Dish 2) looks tasty, but it was for a vegetarian, so inedible. I'll try it later. Also, the rice is inseparable, like it had been sitting for a while or steamed after it was prepared. I will not order from this restaurant again. Now, I have to go cook dinner after spending $36.00 on an inedible dinner."
12/8/2018,3,"I live 2 blocks away so it is very convenient for me. The food is good, nothing special but good. I love sushi but my husband likes cooked food. We both enjoy it for a night when we don't want to cook. I too have a problem with the service. They act like they don't want to be there. If you order something wrong they belittle you. The other day the cashier was telling me something but walked away to help someone else. I kept asking her waist she said but never looked at me again."
3/28/2021,5,The food was good and I got a lot of Katsu. Wish there was more rice but it was all very tasty. I got Japanese curry sauce for dipping and that was so good I could've eaten just the sauce and been happy. Also I got a slush with popping pearls which did not disappoint. All in all very tasty and I'll be eating more from here.
12/4/2018,2,"I'd give the food probably 4 stars. I had to subtract two cuz of the poor service I got from the girl who took my order. I first said I wanted the Spicy Donburi. And I asked if she can add extra salmon to my bowl.  Then she said it doesn't come with salmon, only steak. And she directed me to go to the front door and take another look at the menu. So I did. And I did see with my real eyes that the bowl I tried to order comes with either tuna or salmon. And then I held that menu and reordered it with her. And she just pretended nothing had happened. And I asked her again if I could order extra salmon, she said ""im sure there is a way"". I think this is really rude. And it wasted me 15min cuz by the time I came back to reorder, there were a couple ahead of me already. I would urge the management to do something to ensure better customer experience."
6/28/2020,5,"I go to Bento RELIGIOUSLY and I can't thank them enough for their efforts during these trying times to provide OUTSTANDING customer service on a consistent basis while taking every measure to insure safety and cleanliness. Their staff is absolutely amazing, thoughtful and prompt! You won't find better sushi or poke bowls downtown and the personal touch in service provided by the manager Doug shines through. Keep up the stellar work!"
3/15/2021,3,"I paid almost 20$ for my Poke bowl, I barely got any ingredients besides rice, it's like they are making it look big by putting all that rice and then cover it with 3 pieces of mushrooms, 1 piece of cabbage from kimchi, literally, a bite worth of crab salad ( cost me 3$ to add it by the way) and 3 pieces of fish. I understand that you have to make money but it is not acceptable. I love poke and I've tried poke bowls all over Tampa and St. Pete area, they are usually cheaper and you can get a lot more for that price. Not coming back unfortunately."
7/16/2020,1,70$ worth of food-- not good! Definitely think we should have gotten more food for the price. The food was good but pricy for the amount.
8/7/2019,1,"Customer service: poor. The line had about 15 people and it didn't get to me until about 30 minutes. Being a cafe, self serve/ordering, this sure was not fast whatsoever. And I came to realized it's because the staff at the ordering counter could not give a damn. My friend wanted a bento box, and it was sold out. We asked why, and the reason isn't because the food or ingredients were out, but it's because the bento box container were all out and that might be because they were all dirty and not washed yet. So having said that, the counter person said the manager said it's sold out. Then the manager was this young lady standing right behind him, with even worse attitude and even less care about the business, said it is sold out to the counter clerk while we are standing right there and she could have just explained to us. Then we said, we don't care about it being in a bento box. Is your box is out, they can just put all the food comes in the box on a plate or something and the manager rolled her eyes and said I guess. When the food arrived, it was actually in a bento box.... ???Food: it's not bad at all. But they didn't have the Japanese spicy red chili pepper when they have udon on the menu was a little disappointing. Speed: very very slow to order. But the food came out really fast"
12/28/2019,5,"This place was AMAZING! Food quality and flavor was excellent, and the portions were very generous despite reasonable prices. It's an easy walk if wore unfortunate enough to be staying at the very horrible Hilton in south St. Petersburg."
6/12/2019,5,This place is awesome it's clean it's fast and it has a very reasonable price for sushi. If you like sushi go here. Also all the employees are very nice to the customers. I recommend the sushi box and the Rainbow roll.
9/29/2018,5,"The Build-A-Poke bowl is perfection! The regular size is more than ample. Pick two proteins, one base, up to three additions, two toppings and one sauce. Then prepare to be in a food coma! The best part is it is right next door to our apartment complex!!!"
2/7/2021,4,"I'm a regular at Bento and have not had anything from the menu that I haven't liked. Just like everywhere else, they are human and make mistakes. My orders are very often incorrect, occasionally i receive wrong items or they will forget to include something altogether. They are also very often out of menu items such as crab rangoon or boba. Wait times are also very inconsistent, sometimes the wait is less than 10 minutes, other times it's at least 30. I still come back frequently because the food is so good. I recommend ordering online and checking your order before leaving the store."
3/25/2020,5,Very good sushi. I got the chicken tempura roll and the special mex roll and they were both so good. I called in to order and picked it up. Very convenient and delicious.
12/1/2018,5,"This is probably the only place I would go to for Asian food in St. Pete, my boyfriend and I would typically go to vegan Asian places but we have decided to check this place out because of how much recommendation we heard from our friends. The first time here I ordered their large poke bowl but was disappointed in proportion of the toppings for the price. 2nd time we ordered the food here, I was so mind blown how good it is. I ordered the Pao pao tofu, I'm not even a big fan of tofu but the way they cook it is so addicting (keep in mind their pao pao recipe is different from the original, it's a spicy cream and not a teriyaki base). My boyfriend ordered the red curry chicken katsu which was also amazing. I did ordered sushi the 3rd visit and was disappointed so we will stick with the Asian food."
5/4/2020,1,Stay away from their sushi.  It's priced like it's good sushi but tastes like something you would get at a buffet.  Just awful.  The tuna was starting to turn dark from sitting too long.  I threw away $30 of sushi last night and spent $15 at grumpy gringo and got a great dinner.  This was my second time ordering here as they are always discounted on Uber eats.  I will never go back and I caution anyone to be careful.  Sushi is one thing that can get you very sick and this place is like fast food.
1/26/2021,2,Keep the rice crispy treats off of the sushi please..chicken pretty rubbery- very disappointed
1/24/2021,1,"Every time I call ahead once I get there I still have to wait 20+ minutes, I always call before work and I end up never having time to eat...6 people waked in after me and they all got their food before mine was even ready and I had called ahead of time..I ended up waiting 40 minutes and had to go straight to work I'm not one to complain but this is the 5th time now"
7/19/2019,5,"SO YUM ask for the spicy cream chicken you will not be disappointed!  Also all the sushi is great, and if you have to park in the garage let them know and they will give you a voucher."
6/14/2019,5,Bento has become a weekly visit for me... I absolutely love this place. There are so many options on the menu that I could easily eat here seven days a week and not repeat the same meal twice! Everything is cooked to order. It's outstanding!
10/15/2019,5,"In downtown St Pete, with an explosion of options, this is a core go-to place for me.  Food quality is great.  Portions are generous for the price.  Can customize my bowl to my mood. Service is reasonably quick.  A pleasant setting that isnt too noisy (which is exceedingly rare).  Centrally located.I always walk away delighted!"
12/17/2019,5,Fast quick and efficient service Amethyst remembered me and my order  I'm so glad Bentos has a remembering employee thank you Amethyst for your service I recommend every customer to Ask for Amethyst if yo want quick and efficient service
10/6/2019,1,Canceled our Uber eats order twenty five minutes after we placed it. Won't say why.i called up they say it's because they're out of gen Taos shrimp. I say can you make it with chicken they say yes but we have to reorder through Uber. Go to reorder and it's unavailable. You get one chance to make a first impression and this was a terrible first impression. Highly doubt we'll ever eat here.
10/5/2019,4,"Great for lunch. I would compare to an Asian-style chipotle because one had the option of creating their own bowls. I got a chicken- brown rice poke bowl (not a tuna fan) with shredded carrot, cucumber, avocado, snap peas and Siracha for 7 bucks, not bad for lunch."
6/1/2019,1,"My coworker and I were in st Pete visiting on a work trip. We both got two completely different things and returned to our hotel to get some sleep for the event the following day. We both woke up in the middle of the night throwing up.  Work event didn't go so well. Not sure why but, both of got really sick and the only thing we ate all day was from bento"
12/2/2020,1,Place is awful. Have been to several bentos but this location messes the order up every time. When I addresses it with the cashier they didn't say sorry or do an
1/24/2019,4,"This is a nice addition to the area. I recommend bento for the bento boxes. I've been there twice and both times had the bento box with chicken. It's a ton of food and you get to choose one sauce to accompany your meal.. don't know about you but I'm a fan of sauces. My husband who said he wanted a dinner with ""a lot of food"" was pleased with the amount of food in the bento. We also tried the tuna sushi roll. There is an option to do a half roll, which is what did as an appetizer. The food quality also is good, service is good, wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tea, though. Overall, a satisfying lunch or dinner spot that I'll definitely visit again."
10/4/2019,5,Great atmosphere! Great food! Great drinks! You need to try the dragon drink. The food was delicious.
7/11/2020,5,"We got them thru uber eats and everything was great! I got the sushi combo box and it had the sushi I wanted and noodle and salad side dishes. We also ordered the chicken pad Thai and that was tasty as well. A lot of uber eats orders aren't that great, especially sushi, but this place was really good!!"
9/7/2020,1,"We are regulars at Bento, unfortunately  the St Pete location continues to disappoint. We ordered online and PAID for extra spicy mayo, yet it never came, along with requested silverware, chopsticks, AND soy sauce. I have never ordered sushi and it had NOT come with chopsticks and soy sauce at the least. A COMPLETE disappointment. BEWARE"
11/6/2018,5,"YAY!! A Bento in St. Pete!! I'm so excited! Bento is one of my Gainesville favorites. I insisted my dad (who lives in St. Pete) meet me for lunch the exact moment I found out it existed. I parked right out front and paid the meter because I didn't know any better but for all of you reading this, Bento has an agreement with the apartment complex building where you can park there for free to visit Bento and you basically receive validated parking. I always appreciate a restaurant doing their best to create parking for their customers. We ordered and received our food promptly. I always order the spicy cream chicken (Pao Pao) with mini udon noodles and my dad ordered the sweet and sour pineapple chicken with brown rice. They always give you huge portions and my dad ate all of it so I'm pretty sure he was pleased. I ate 2/3s and took the remainder home for the hubby. It was just as delicious as the food at their flagship location so I will be making the hike to St. Pete regularly for my Bento fix. For a new restaurant, there were no issues to report and that is saying something."
6/9/2020,1,"Love the food however the guy bagging the food was using the same gloves running the register , touching and finger combing his hair and packing and boxing the food. Talk about NASTY! Even mentioned to a manager and he didn't say anything to him. Just Bagged our food for us instead. And he would wipe his face and finger comb again touch the food stuff and repeat. Not sanitary at all. But the food is good I must say."
1/8/2019,5,"Interesting sushi concept. I loved the fact that you can make a meal with your roll that includes soft drink, edamame, miso soup or salad. Pretty reasonably priced, quick lunch service. Would return for lunch again!"
10/5/2018,1,"I went into this restaurant for lunch today, thinking I'd be in and out in 2 seconds, and the entire time I was in there my photograph was being taken without my consent - only after I was already sitting down and multiple pictures of me (looking terrible) had already been taken, was a sign placed on the door that said ""Shoot in progress... If you do not feel comfortable with this, please attend a different location."" Well, I wouldn't have gone in the restaurant had I known I was going to be immortalized forever in sweatpants w/ no bra. Thanks a lot for violating my privacy."
1/1/2019,5,Ordered last minute for New Years Eve. Loved everything we got. Will definitely be back
4/16/2019,5,This place is being added to my list of great places to eat in Downtown St. Pete. I ordered take out and was very back and forth about trying a new place but the quality of the food was amazing! I put special instructions to prepare the chicken extra crispy because sometimes orange chicken can get too breaded and they nailed it. I will definitely be ordering again in the future.
10/27/2018,5,"Their sushi bowls are delicious! Great options, very fast, and super fresh. Been back a few times!"
11/14/2019,5,"Another favorite eatery from our Gainesville days, now with a location near us (over the bridge in St. Pete)!  Spicy creamy chicken (now called Pao Pao chicken) is such a creamy and crunchy delight!  The sushi bowls are fresh and well portioned!  The sushi is outstanding and nothing here will break the bank.  Great flavors and selection.  Great casual date location or family dinner.   Katsu chicken with ramen noodles is also great to share!  Boba tea is available for those who are into it.    For families with children, I'd recommend you start with the chicken katsu and pao pao chicken.  Crunch roll on the side.  This is our children's favorite restaurant. Very excited to see a new location coming to the Tampa USF area but still holding out hope they will open a location in South Tampa!   How else will able be able to cater my group's and family events without a closer location?  I'm getting hungry writing this review...gotta go back."
1/4/2019,5,"I love Bento.  Used to stop by everytime I was in Orlando, so happy they opened a St. Pete location.  Everything I've ordered is great.  Good service / friendly staff as well."
3/9/2019,5,Had a great first visit to the St Pete location. Ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken and some krab wontons which are like crab Rangoon. Also ordered some small sushi rolls. The food was excellent and the fried rice bowl was large enough for 3 people.  Clean restaurant and the staff was very friendly. Will be back.
2/25/2020,2,"I have been here several times and the food is usually pretty good, however this time I got the poke bowl with tuna and chicken. The tuna and the bowl was fairly good, but the chicken was a little suspect. I ordered grilled teriyaki chicken and expected to find white meat chicken but what I received was grizzly dark meat chicken which was horrible. I will return but will steer clear of the chicken unless it's changed."
2/11/2020,5,"Highly recommended. Chipotle style Asian food. Nicely designed, clean, good food, friendly staff, affordable, healthy, large portions."
2/4/2020,5,"I typically bring my lunch to work but recently, have had to order take out using various delivery services (ie: uber eats).  In my experience using these delivery services, I mentally prepare for the food to not be as up to par as if you were to physically eat in the establishment.  I chop that up to the price we pay for the convenience of ordering food through a third party vendor for pick up/delivery.  This has not been an issue when ordering from Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi.  The food has always been made with love and packaged carefully.  I've ordered everything from sushi bento boxes to lo mein dishes and Bento Asian Kitchen has not sacrificed their food preparation when preparing take out orders.  Veggies are always cooked perfectly, different flavors stand out on their own and dishes have not been overcooked.  The sushi shows up just as expected.  Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi will continue to be my go to on those days when I'm forced to order delivery."
7/20/2019,1,so I   just ordered sushi from here on uber eats I   honestly couldn't even eat it! it tasted so flipping fishy and the fish was so rubbery!! CLEARLY the fish they use isn't good and they arent properly rotating it!
10/15/2018,4,Thought it was pretty good and really liked the Bento Box concept. As someone who tends to over eat it provides just the right portions. Felt full but not over stuffed. Will definitely go back for more.
10/13/2018,4,"Though the prices had us a little wary, fixed incomers that we are, Bento Cafe's ample portions, great flavors, vibrant decore and hospitable staff won our wallets! Seldom does my husband carry home left-overs, but some of his katsu pork cutlet came home with us. Just a block from our apartment, we'll be thinking inside the box often."
10/6/2018,5,"Great food, clean environment, friendly staff. Sushi rolls and poke bowl were delicious. Loved the different size options for poke bowls. Will frequent this location way too often."
11/7/2019,1,"Came here for lunch and it took over 30 minutes for them to prepare our to go order and when we got it, it was only half of the order. Luckily my friend was able to get a refund for her part but no one apologized or tried to help in anyway. The crowd of people waiting for pick up and to go orders completely clogged the entrance. The food I got was good but didn't make up for the wait."
7/26/2019,3,"First time here and ordered the Szechuan chicken over brown rice. The portion size is rather small for the price and there was way too much sauce that totally drenched everything. The sauce also had way too much salt in it and I felt like I was going to have a hypernatremic episode. All in all, this place was just okay. Nothing special whatsoever and I could get better quality and taste elsewhere."
11/11/2018,5,"I had the best Bento box ever! They serve fresh amazing sushi, bento boxes, boba teas, and the best udon noodles! Highly recommend! The staff was super friendly and gave great suggestions!"
6/29/2019,3,"Was just alright, first time in a poke bowl the krab was strips and not krab salad, didn't really taste fresh."
1/16/2019,4,"I was super excited to finally have a Bento in the St.Pete area because of all the hype I had gotten from all my friends in the Gainesville area. My sister and I stopped in for dinner with the my nieces and nephew the first week the opened, and to our surprise it was not super crazy busy. Totally not complaining because we did not wait long at all to order or for our meals to be brought out. So if you have never been here before, you will view a menu and order at the register. Once your order is placed, you will receive a number and you can have a seat at any open table. A Bento team member will deliver your order to you at your table. There were 3 adults, 3 kids, and we spent a pretty good amount on our dinner for ""Chinese"" food. My sister felt it was a little pricey for the amount of meals we ordered, but I felt the portions were a good size, the ambience was nice, and the quality of food was worth it. The kids even ate all of their food which was pretty shocking especially my nephew who is the pickiest eater I know! I actually think it's an added bonus for kids because their meals came in cute little bento boxes that they all wanted to take home (but of course didn't). We ordered a mix of bento box meals, sushi, and tuna bowl. I enjoyed everything, but I did not really care for the tuna bowl. It was just lacking flavor in the tuna since it was not marinated and was just topped with different sauces that we requested. My favorite had to be the katsu and the pao pao spicy shrimp (which is not at all spicy just super delicious)!"
6/26/2019,1,"So their statement on the menu 'substitute brown rice upon request' isn't actually true.  I attempted to order the Combo Box and was told no I couldn't have the brown rice.  I then asked if I ordered the items separately could I have the brown rice, she said yes.  I told her that made no sense.  She never even offered an upcharge as an option.  Won't be going there again which is a shame since I live next door.  Too many great options in downtown St Pete to deal with this lunacy."
5/31/2019,5,So glad we stopped by this place before our concert just blocks away. Fresh taste and perfect temperature when served. We both loved our entrees so much that we decided to eat half and take the other half home.
6/12/2019,5,"I visited Bento yesterday evening, it was honestly an amazing experience. The environment was so clean and inviting and the workers were so friendly and looked happy to be there. The food was absolutely to die for, I'm a sucker for Asian cuisine. I  had the Sriracha Garlic Chicken and their Wontons (it's definitely a must try)! The employees made sure I had everything I needed and didn't make me feel uncomfortable or stupid when I asked for something. The one employee with the braids was super sweet to me and made me feel super welcome. I 100% recommend visiting Bento, whether it is to try the food or not. I have been to many restaurant chains, none that have made me feel so welcome all while having good food and quick service. I will be coming back eventually and I look forward to it!"
6/2/2019,4,"1st time - took the dogs, seating outside, water bowls.  2 orders - took about 10 mins.  Rice bowl with veg stir fry, noodle bowl with tofu, spring rolls. Very tasty,  rice was clumpy though!  We parked in Publix, were in and out in 15 mins.  7 PM on Saturday night,  not busy, walked right up to the counter."
11/27/2018,5,Tried it for the first time yesterday. It was busy at dinner time. The restaurant smelled amazing.  We ordered a somewhat mainstream Signature bowl and an 8-piece sushi roll to-go and both were fresh and really good. The go packaging included all the condiments you would expect. Will definitely go back and try some of the more inventive menu items. Great new concept for DTSP.
2/2/2019,3,The food is always tasty. But I have yet to get a fully correct order from them. There's always something missing. Or the cooks just completely ignored a simple modification of an item or subtraction. Laziness or ticket error? The food is good enough to give it one more ( of many) attempts. But it's things like these that just turn me off of ordering out from anywhere and keep me cooking at home. And I am not picky.
1/30/2019,5,This place is really good! I went around peak lunch time and the line moved easily - didn't take long to get food either. I got a sesame chicken bowl with rice; it had really good flavor and wasn't too salty (as some foods in Asian cuisine can be). Big portions for the price! Very clean and overall a great atmosphere. This is a great addition to downtown St. Pete's lunch spots. I'll definitely be back
7/6/2022,4,"What a great surprise deciding to eat lunch here!  It was not busy at all and the service and ticket times were excellent.  Service is a tricky aspect of dining out for the past few years and the ""Covid"" excuse is overused as an excuse for poor service and attitudes.We ordered:-cup of soup of the day ""Shrimp Tom Yum""-Shrimp Tempura Udon Soup-Pao Pao Noodle Bowl with Chicken -Gochujang Garlic Noodle w/chicken EVERYTHING was fresh, hot and delicious!  I tried for a picture but didn't make it!!...sorry!!!I will definitely go back as soon as I can and HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone!!"
12/23/2022,1,"I wish 0 stars was an option that's HOW BAD it was. Service, horrible, food, not worth $16 for those cheap sushi roles and hard gross app. To make it even worst i paid almost $100 and they gave me my food in Togo boxes not even in regular plates because i arrived 50 minutes before closing. My 2 sons and I went out to have a nice family night and instead we ended up grumpy because we waited almost 45 minutes for our food!!!!!!!!! Then when the 35 minute mark hit i went up to the kitchen to ask how much longer and the kitchen staff said ""oh it's sushi it's not ready."" I said how much longer it's been almost 40 minutes? He quickly snapped loudly and said "" we will get to it when it's ready!!!!"" And i told him he should not speak to a customer that's been waiting 40 minutes that way. The cashier was super rude which was a sign i should have left from the beginning. The reason why we talked in was because of the boba sign outside and when we got there at 8:10pm they said they closed the boba machine.Other customers that were also waiting 30-40 min heard the kitchen staff snap at me and told me that he too snapped at them. One guy said he asked for a Togo box and he gave him attitude saying you know they're over there and just pointed. All around the staff is a bunch of young kids that are RUDE.We ended up having our family dinner outside in our Togo boxes because i was so turned off by how rude the staff was being and being around other unhappy customers that were also starving. The floors were disgustingly wet and sticky one staff member even slipped and fell in front of the customers. I feel like i wasted my money. So sad. Don't go there trust me the food is not worth it and the experience is horrible."
10/31/2022,3,"On my first visit, the fried rice was much better than I expected. My first visit I ordered red curry and it was delicious. I couldn't wait to go back.The 2nd visit, I ordered the green curry. It was bland and some of the rice seemed bland and crunchy (undercooked). It left much to be desired. I haven't made any plans to return, but I'll chalk it up to the chef having a bad night. I would give them one more chance - but that's it."
1/10/2022,2,"... it's hard to give this place even 3 stars. I'll tell you why. The interior of this place is fantastic, and the design of website makes it look so visually appealing... BUT here's the kicker. The foooood.... Is okay... at best. The entrées and menu are promising (photos, etc) but not the taste. I got a bento box, miso soup, and kimchi. My favorite thing out of it all was probably the kimchi. Spicy, earthy, and tasty. Everything else, makes me question the freshness and sourcing of the ingredients. The Sichuan bento box has white rice, which sits in the container soaking up a overly sweet... soy sauce? I didn't think it was super great because white rice helps cleanse your palette and make you feel less saturated with all of the strong flavors. The soup tasted okay, seemed a bit like the base came from a package though. The salad was plain, covered in something similar to a ginger sauce, it was fine. The noodles were a liiittle weird though... haha strange tasting and had a pungent stinky, stale smell (like cat pee... YIKES LOL so I didn't finish those). Green beans were also a bit odd tasting, and had a layer of oldness to it. The chicken and steak were just very underwhelming and also heavily carried  by the sweet sauce. Which was fine, and no fault of the chefs/employees. But the company should try to buy fresh meat and nice quality produce, this tastes like it came out of a box too.Something funny was the Wonton strips they add, they taste exactly like the cinnamon twists from Taco Bell... LOL And for 18.00 (added steak to the box; 15-16$ usually) you sort of expect better. I could have went to an actual Asian restaurant and got a whole meal... expected this place to be somewhat nicer, or authentic because of its presentation, but it is not haha... Panda Express is similar in concept, but better because their ingredients taste real/fresh without funky flavors. And don't even try the boba, if you're a big boba fan LOL it's quite disappointing, but again it's not a Boba place. Anyways, I'm not sure if it was just a bad day, but I'm sure it's more of a corporate supply choice for the food/ingredients for the boba and entrees. Maybe someone who works in the offices can look into making the food better. Because it looks great and is nice/calming to sit in, alongside a nice staff and a very appealing menu. But it really does miss the mark unfortunately. Would love to try it again if they redid their food/boba.TLDR: looks upscale, charges upscale, but doesn't taste upscale. The food value does not match the cost. Interior is sleek, fresh, fun and cool. This place has no problem attracting people, the food just needs a bit of improvement"
6/16/2022,5,What can I say? Ever since I tried the Pao Pao chicken rice bowl I have been addicted to this place. I go at least once a week. Yea I know that's pretty unhealthy but man this bowl has my number. I love it so much. You have to try it!! It never misses-- and the veggies are great too. The peppers are delicious. Try this bowl and then you can thank me later.
12/19/2022,3,"Service great, food not so much. Staff were very nice and helpful but food very plain not much flavor we were actually surprised."
12/19/2021,4,"This is located in the University Town Center, just off I-75 and University.  The food is good for a semi-fast food concept.  You order at the counter and are provided a number.  You take your choice of seats either inside or outside (which is primarily a view of the next door California Kitchen, which typically has a TV with sports on).  They bring the food to your table when readyFood options are both sushi and bowls.  I tried a Bento box for $15 with chicken. You could then select the style of the box, where I chose Mongolian.  There is a lot of good food in the box (4 stars).Others in my party tried the Florida roll sushi (4 stars) and the chicken fried rice (3.5 stars).  The sushi was pretty standard and gluten free.  You are also given the option for one sauce on the side, which everyone choose Spicy Mayo (5 stars).Service: 2 stars. The lone person taking orders at the register had the personality of a newt.  Absolutely no desire to be there.  The person who brought the food out was nice and made sure the orders were right.  Beyond that you are on your own, including taking all your trash to a return window that reminded me of a cafeteria diner. Parking can be tight when it it busy, but there is usually plenty of additional parking across the street towards the main mall."
3/30/2022,5,"A great place for a quick lunch or dinner.   Serving asian fusion ""fast food"", so you can satisfy several cravings here whether it be a Mongolian beef bento box or some sushi.  Options for everyone here."
11/9/2022,3,Had a teriyaki chicken bowl with fried rice and a sushi roll. The bowl was good but the sushi was not. The roll was bland with no sauce topping. Put a little soy sauce on it and that's all you taste. Stick with the bowls and save your sushi appetite for a real sushi restaurant.
6/16/2022,4,"Some really good options! Tried the sushi and it did not disappoint, can't wait to try the boba and other offerings! A lot of room sit, takes a while to get your food but worth it."
11/3/2021,4,"Nice to dine at a clean and upscale fast Asian restaurant. They served sushi, bento boxes, and even have boba. The kid size was just enough for me and had great flavor."
7/13/2022,5,Staff was super friendly and ready to help with your order. They answered all my questions and I didnt feel bad asking. Food was fast and fresh. Bobba tea is always a classic and they know how to make it right!
7/1/2022,5,"Bento is by far one of the best Sushi places around. Also, if you like COCONUT YELLOW CURRY chicken dishes they got you covered. The service is super nice and the atmosphere is chill. I like ordering from the app and come in to pick up counter. Super friendly staff. Enjoy."
4/27/2022,1,Bring your own spoon!I ordered the tofu udon soup. Luckily I was watching the server put in the order because he put in chicken udon and I do not eat meat. I asked if the udon soup came with vegetables in it. When a different server brought my udon the tofu was on the side and the vegetables were in a bowl on the side. I asked the server for a spoon and she pointed me to the plastic utensils. The only option to eat soup was a very shallow small plastic teaspoon. What?  The broth had no flavor. The vegetables looked like they came out of a bag. I got the bill and saw that they had charged me $4.50 for the vegetables. If you are going to charge someone $4.50 for a tiny bowl of vegetables that you inferred came with the soup. PLEASE let them know. If you are going to sell someone a bowl of soup PLEASE ask them if they brought their own spoon because you will not be providing one for them.
1/3/2022,2,"This place is awful, it is clearly not ran by someone who understands food and customer service/experience. Microwave quality at best, ordered stir fry bowls, both were swimming in sauce and extremely salty (I guess like this review ). Same for miso soup, way too salty, also, keep miso soup simple, leave out the cheap mushrooms, no one asked for them.We initially came in for sushi, as named and advertised, only to be told by the cashier that they are currently not doing sushi... what kind of restaurant has sushi in their name and doesn't do sushi. The poor guy taking our order didn't even have a solid answer as to why they don't have sushi.Menu: the menu is vast and is best suited for waiter service type of a restaurant, there are far too many choices to decide upon in a matter of a couple of minutes. Tip: either simplify the menu if you're trying to be like chipotle or blaze pizza, or consider having waiter service.Price: too much for what we received, and I actually don't care how much I pay as long as I'm wowed, I wasn't even a little bit.It is sad that the best item were the dumplings, I guess it's pretty hard to mess them up, especially if they came out of a bag and into the deep fryer.This place has potential, but won't be here much longer if changes aren't made.Also, I despise being offered to leave a tip at the register, not knowing what my service will be like or what my food will taste like, both were very disappointing.Good luck, you'll need it."
6/19/2022,1,Ordered on ubereats while staying in sarasota. The food was terrible. The chicken smelled strange and tasted horrible. The best part of the bento box was the white rice. Overpriced and inedible. Save your money.
1/8/2021,3,We tried the Pad Thai and the Korean bowls. We were just ok with the flavors and the value. This had just opened at the UTC. I just think the local operated restaurants beat the pants off the chain restaurants.The restaurant was clean and service was good.
7/30/2022,2,It's a beautiful building but the food didn't live up to expectations . Wanted to love it ! Source better quality steak please .. haven't tasted meat like that since frozen dinners as a kid .
12/24/2021,1,Very bad food. Don't waste your money. I just wasted $65 for 3 very bad tasting dishes.
1/16/2022,1,"What a terrible disappointment.  Our Mongolian steak bento box was utterly tasteless. The sauce on the Mongolian steak was bland and watery.  Everything else in the box was equally without any flavorand just didn't look or taste fresh.They charge as if they are an upscale restaurant, but serve food of less than fast food quality.  Shame on them.  Is the publicthat gullible to accept this as an acceptable Asian restaurant?Don't bother with this one.  A waste of money."
4/3/2021,5,The service is excellent. You order then they give you a table number and you place it on the table and they will bring it to you. You will have to pick up your extra spice but you won't need it. Also get the chopsticks before you sit. The food is really top quality. Better than other restaurants with full services. Really good and fresh food.
9/5/2021,2,Overpriced supermarket sushi and frozen reheated Orange chicken.  The Garlic Endamne was good.  My daughters meal came before the Endamne and then the it  came 5 minutes later.  My meal came a good 15 minutes after my daughters meal.  Everything was just okay.   The girl working the counter didn't know what came with my meal. I asked what  came with the sushi box I was ordering and she said nothing just the rolls you order.  When the meal came it had two different types of salad.  They refuse to except cash and are rude about it. I won't be back.
3/28/2021,4,I'm all about second chances and I decided to give bento one. I'm so glad I did. I definitely think there was improvement. With that being said I definitely think this place is hot or miss. Sometimes it's great other times not so much. I don't know if I just went at a better time and things where fresher. I went around 6:00 this time and 5:30 last time. I got a orange chicken bento box and a poke bowl and both where delicious. Each item in the bento box where hot and just better this time. The poke bowl had good flavor and overall things where better this time.
1/31/2021,4,Great boba tea and great food.  I'm excited Bentos finally opened up in Sarasota.  It was my go to place in college back in the day.  I usually go for the Mongolian rice bowl and never disappoints
1/29/2021,3,"Yes I know places are doing their best during COVID however it should not take 30 mins for a rice bowl. The food was OK but not $15 for a bowl. They add $5 if you want fried rice. Also, when asked about how much longer the lady had the nerve to tell me "" you know it's not easy work"". Good luck hope you figure things out. I will stick with the Yummy house for authentic Asian food"
1/19/2022,4,"I was a little concerned after reading the reviews of this place, but we decided to try it anyways and I was glad we did. They do not have sushi right now, just as a warning to those that are going there for that. It is a little pricey for a fast casual place. The food, however, was good. My sons both loved their food (Korean rice bowl with steak and fried rice, Garlic Broccoli rice bowl with steak) and my youngest son is pretty picky when it comes to Asian restaurants. I had the Sichuan bento box with chicken, I wasn't crazy about the sauce but the chicken and vegetables in it were fresh, not frozen like some reviewers mentioned. The green beans on the side were delicious, the noodles were plain on their own but a good complement to the chicken. My husband had the Gochujang bento box with chicken, his chicken was fried which I don't think he expected and was pretty spicy but good. We also had no issues with service except that my youngest son's meal came out a few minutes later than the rest of our food. Overall we will definitely be back! Oh and they do have outdoor seating which was great and unexpected."
8/19/2021,3,"The food here is really good, but they have a limited menu and it is not clear what they do and do not have. I went in twice and ended up leaving without food due to them being out of what I wanted. I hope they can recover from the pandemic and get their full menu back so I can update my review."
6/1/2021,1,"Usually, an establishment works out their kinks after being open for a while. Not in this case. We visited them in their first few days and were not impressed, so we wanted to give them another chance. It seems as if the staff doesn't care and is completely satisfied with a less than mediocre restaurant. We ordered two things for lunch; a noodle bowl and a poke bowl. The noodle bowl came out in less than 10 minutes. The poke bowl, with all cold ingredients, took more than 30 minutes. It may have taken longer but we had to go to the cashier to find out when the other half of our order would arrive. This would be fine if the food had some flavor, but it truly is nothing to write home about. If they would just add some positive energy to their atmosphere it might make a difference. Instead, this restaurant makes you feel as if you are dining with a group of depressed sloths unable to prepare the menu or clean the dining room (it was filthy). Unfortunately, we will not return."
12/3/2021,5,Always a winner! The rolls are decent sized and the poke bowls are generous. Must tries: sushi combo box and surf n' turf poke bowl
6/10/2021,1,Pissed!  All I wanted after a 2 hour drive was dinner.  I walked in and stood in line to get to the counter to be turned away and told that the kitchen was closed.  They did take the order from the group in front of me.  I wish I could give no stars.  Sucky service!
7/9/2021,3,"Too much rice, too little vegetables. Teriyaki steak didn't come with teriyaki on the steak. Came in a plastic container on the side. You want to do something awesome for your bowls? Go take a look at Fresh Kitchen and make an Asian version of that. Over there I pick my rice, protein, two vegetables all for $11 and the portions are perfect."
10/19/2021,5,Love coming here once a week with my kids. They enjoy the boba teas. Staff is always friendly and the quality of food it's amazing for the price point. My favorite are the orange chicken and Mongolian steak.
1/10/2021,1,"We waiting 30 minutes for our to-go food with the restaurant not busy. We live maybe 5 minutes away and after we got our food, both meals were cold, had incorrect items and had no flavor. I would advise skipping this place and going to Shake Shake next door."
2/27/2021,3,I like bento Asian a lot but this specific one I've had issues with recently. Just this week I've ordered 3 times with Uber eats. The first time I ordered a poke bowl with salmon and they gave me tuna instead. And I just ordered one today with salmon and they gave me spicy salmon which I can't eat. They don't look at the tickets and read them they just throw whatever in your bowl. I will likely not be ordering from here as often if I'm going to continue paying $17 to get it delivered and then get the wrong food.
1/10/2021,5,"The food was excellent! I had the pineapple fried rice, while my fiancé had General Tso Rice bowl. They are definitely in a soft opening and working out kinks with the inside seating, but the food quality and taste more than made up for it."
7/16/2021,1,Employees were nice BUT the food is not authentic. I was very disappointed because I was craving Asian food and was very excited to eat here. There are better places to eat than here.
6/28/2021,5,Food was great! I ordered during a busy time and it was clear they were understaffed - the staff was friendly and even thought it took a while for me food to come out (poke bowl) it was great (:
6/4/2021,2,"I really wanted to support  a local business but after several times the service is really bad , food is cold but somehow takes forever to be ready, and it's pricey. I tried going again because their popping boba is really good! I give a star for that but there's no large size for 2  small /regular cup it's 10$ (including popping boba add on) . I don't mind that but when I wanted to order all the staff ignored me and what seemed to be the manager told me to wait while she was on the tablet.  And then I had to wait AGAIN to order some staff weren't even doing anything they were just wiping stuff down . The atmosphere in that place is bunch of kids who don't want to work. And the food is pretty bland unless your getting sushi. Plus paper straws get soggy but it's good to be sustainable. I hope the best for the future of this business. On top of of me waiting to order I had to wait 10 minutes for 2 slushies."
1/21/2021,3,"I will say that the sushi was good, but our vegetable stir fry was very bland. The mex and special mex roll had good flavor, but the chicken tempura had barely any taste. My boyfriend likes the caliente sushi, but all I could taste was the jalepenos and nothing else. Our friend said the Szechuan sauce was not very good. I would order the mex roll again but probably not anything else."
2/26/2021,2,"well, i'll start out with the good.  the mt fuji sushi was very tasty. but the ""manager"" putting her finger less than an inch away from my food!...  absolutely left it waaay less enjoyable!  i had 2 sushi orders for 2 separate people,  and for some reason they thought they should put both orders in the same container! where do they do that at???!  that was about 3 weeks ago.  thought i'd give it another shot today and boy, i really should have went somewhere else.  i had to ask if they had a problem serving black people here when i watched the person before me and ""4""... four customers ""after me"" get their take out food ahead of me!   i was the only black person in the restaurant waiting & watching other non black people  ordered their food, wait a few reasonable minutes for their food, get their food, eat their food and then leave . all the while im still sitting their waiting until i finally ask the server ( turned out to be ""the manager"") "" is there a problem with my food?""... it took another 5 minutes to get my food! she didnt even offer any sort of compensation, just an ""im sorry & ill get your order out in just axfew more minutes""  took 5 more minutes!  im just asking... does this establishment have a problem serving black people???"
