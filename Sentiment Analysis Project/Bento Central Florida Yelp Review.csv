11/13/2022,5,Wow this place is def worth the 5 stars Food was delicious !!!Crunchy roll and pao pao shrimp was amazingly good !!!!  I def recommend coming here. Portions were big for the price.  So flavorful. Don't over think it and just come here. You won't regret it
11/27/2022,2,"After shopping, we tried this place and had a very disappointing experience.  The staff does not greet customers and you have to order on a tablet-like machine.We ordered the fried pork dumplings and veggie spring rolls.  Both tasted like they came from the freezer section at the grocery store.Minimal menu and no service whatsoever. We will NOT be back and do not recommend it."
12/3/2022,5,"Bento is BOMB!! I'm absolutely obsessed with Bento Asian Kitchen. I am a basic sushi lover. For the longest I would only eat California rolls. Now that Bento has come into my life I have ventured out of my comfort zone. Tonight I arrived at their poké bowl and I loved it so much. The ingredients at Bento are so fresh. Like SHIITake mushrooms how have I been missing this my entire life. Also, I was sick today and realized that this is the perfect meal when you need to put something in your stomach but cannot have lots of sugars or dairy. Fresh and filling."
4/27/2022,4,"I will say two things about this Bento location. 1. Their takeout is about the worse thing I have ever seen. I waited a full 30 minutes longer than I was told it would be for my takeout order. But, that actually holds true for all three Bento locations I've ever done takeout at. So, a word of advice, if you're ordering takeout from a Bento, tell them you want to pick up the food 30 minutes before you actually want it. I'm not kidding.2. Once you finally get your food, Bento has the best quick service sushi in the entire Central Florida area. I do not remember what rolls I got that day, but you can check the picture to see how bright and vibrant they look. All of the seafood tasted fresh and had a good texture. The sauces and herbs they used were not too much, and complemented flavors well. And the little crunchy things they put on that one roll were genius. Sushi roll's biggest lacking sometimes is texture, so these flavorless little balls of crunch were perfect. Overall, four stars is the perfect way to describe this place. Not perfect, but still amazingly delicious."
1/26/2022,2,"I'm going to start by saying I will never patron at any bento again. I don't remember what time we arrived but it took about 20 mins to get our food. There were other ppl waiting for their orders so it could've been a bit longer. By 10:30 they had turned off the lights in the entire place. We were still eating.The food was decent, the only reason I'm giving more than one star. They also offer beer, seltzers, & wine. I enjoyed the garlic string beans & miso soup. The rice & noodles didn't have much flavor. The spring rolls were greasy but I am glad they were veggie ones. The wontons could've been better. We asked for no avocado in our sushi roll. We sent it back but didn't want to wait for a remake. A bit pricey for the portions. The place seemed clean but overall not a good experience."
6/4/2022,4,"I often come to this Bento location because it's the closest to my place in Downtown Orlando but if I had to drive, I probably wouldn't come because of parking. I give it a 4 out of 5 for the parking, sometimes long waits for food/service and they do not accept cash.Sometimes when we have ordered to go and arrived well after the time they told us it would be ready, we would still have to wait 10-15 minutes.Other than that, everything I've had here over the many times, has been really good. My tried and true is the chicken teriyaki & sichuan rice bowl(s).I often opt for the Mt Fuji sushi roll and the Crunch signature roll as I am not a real sushi connoisseur."
4/11/2022,4,"I always enjoy bento and think they have good food. I haven't been to this location in years, but its good to see it made it through the pandemic! Centrally located in downtown and convenient. Quick service which is really nice. The food was good, although I would t recommend orange chicken and udon noodles, I couldn't make up my mind of what I wanted and this combination turned out to be very sweet. 4-star rating for this visit at this location because there were som dirty tables around that took a while to get cleaned off."
9/28/2022,4,"Got some solid takeout here one night and it was delicious! For a Japanese place, the Korean food hits different!"
2/9/2022,5,"I really enjoy this place for food. They have a good selection, but the menu is super easy to follow along and get what you want.Or you can try one of the main dishes, and they know what they are doing. The food came out really quick and was really hot. I was shocked at how fast they were with how busy this place was.This is a perfect place for a quick meal or to take your time and enjoy the food."
2/18/2022,5,"Mmm Bento! This is by far my favorite Bento locations throughout Central Florida. Came into the restaurant and our order was taken immediately. The staff was very attentive and busy! The establishment is clean but a little too crowded with furniture that it was an obstacle to get to the restrooms. Our order was taken, we sat down and our food took maybe about 20 minutes to come to the table. I don't mind the wait for food because that's an indicator that they're making it fresh. I ordered the chicken katsu Japanese curry, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken garlic broccoli noodles. The food was piping hot and so delicious! Definitely a place you should eat at when you're around town. The menu seems a lot simpler than other places, and I'm glad. Wish I took a picture of our food before we slammed it -- it was so delicious! This is the ONLY Bento place I'm going to!"
11/16/2021,3,"Cool vibe and great menu offerings. I ordered a create your own bowl and got to choose two bases, two proteins, five toppings, two small extras, and a sauce! And there were so many options within those options. I truly could customize it however I wanted and make it healthy for my eating style. My bowl was fresh and very yummy. I will say though, for the price, I thought the portion was very small. I got double salad as my base, and I could have sworn it looked like a single portion. I only got two pieces of cucumber and one slice of ginger, and they completely forgot my edamame. The fish pieces were pretty big but very few and far between.All in all, the vibe of the restaurant is cool and the food was tasty, but the portions left a hole in my wallet with me definitely wanting more."
9/2/2021,2,"I would give them one star for service.  They have a sign that says they are ""experience longer wait times due to covid and number of employees.""  Seriously?  I counted 4 people out in the service area and there must have been at least 1 cook.  I was the only person in the place and it took 20 min.  Ridiculous.  Food was good so they get 2 stars.  Step it up people."
4/27/2022,3,"Pretty good food, decent sushi, relatively fair price. Service is a bit on the slow side, but it's downtown...and a BIG negative for me... they don't accept cash...Found that out when I tried to pay. Who doesn't take cash? It's unheard of!  If they ever decide to take cash, I'll give them another star.Solid 3 stars til then."
1/10/2022,5,Wait time was pretty long but typical for a sushi restaurant delivery. Loved my food. Ordered through Ubereats. Will order from here again.
9/2/2022,3,Order from here frequently. A little pricy for the food but love the pad Thai. Ordered the poke bowl for a second time and the amount they give for the price ($19) is not worth it. Poke Hana has been the best for a poke bowl in the area.
8/27/2022,1,I asked for hoisin sauce and she was like we aren't Chinese and she was giving me a lot of attitude and I asked for a refund and she says we don't do that here and I was extremely turned off don't ever come here they have an extreme attitude. And seriously if the food was even good I would've restrained myself but unfortunately it wasn't.
2/27/2022,3,"The food was delicious and fresh! My daughter and I both ordered sushi rolls and we were extremely happy with our choices!! The waitress was not very friendly. When we asked where we could get napkins, she curtly pointed to the back area by the soda machine. Later, I asked if we could get a to go box and she again pointed back on the counter by the napkins and never offered to get them for us. She seemed very annoyed with our questions. Having never been there before, we had no idea. I'd go again though, the food was amazing!!"
11/30/2021,4,"(10/29/2021) the office pitched in for a DoorDash delivery for lunch. Got a Build-A-Poke Bowl, Garlic String Beans, Veggie Spring Rolls. It was kind of a dreary day, the food was fresh, on time, and the highlight of the day. Green beans were blistered from s quick fry, savory, garlicky, and tender.  Veggie Spring Rolls were crisp, moist interiors, not greasy.  I probably could've used more sauces for my poke bowl, but I'm also a condiment fiend.  Fish was the trim from other parts, like off the fillet, and pretty fresh, but not pristine (condiments help)."
1/20/2022,1,"Came here to grab a quick lunch to go before a meeting.  I clearly explained my gluten allergy and got help ordering.  I waited 25 minutes for my salad. When I got back to my office, I had fried chicken on it. FFS, I can't have gluten, which is in the breading and the fryer.  I took it back, and they nicely offered to remake it.  Where I waited another 30 minutes for a salad!  A simple GRILLED CHICKEN SALAD! I finally was able to eat 2.5 hours after I ordered the original salad, (to be fair I did have a meeting, and couldn't bring back the original salad until it ended), and it's just OK.  Nothing special, but it was $16!  I won't be returning."
4/14/2022,4,"Decided to stop in for a quick dinner and was not disappointed. I got the Coconut Red Curry chicken bowl with udon noodles; very good with a good variety of veggies! It had a good amount of spice, but just the right amount for me (I like moderate levels of spice). My girlfriend got the Orange chicken bowl with udon noodles. It was a little too sweet with the noodles, she would recommend it with rice instead."
5/30/2021,5,Glad they have this place as we were a bit hungry. A colleague and I came here for the first time. At first I was taken aback as you have to place your order upfront and then they'll serve it to you. You basically have to go get your own drinks...kind of self serve in a way. Not used to it but I don't mind a change. The service was incredibly fast and the food is actually very good. I would definitely dine here again. The staff were friendly and accommodating.
8/20/2022,3,"I have gone to this restaurant many times for lunch which is always awfully packed. Thankfully, they have the option to order pick up which helped save me time. I have had their lunch specials which include sushi that have been hit or miss. I hate that the prices have gone up and the food being subpar."
1/11/2022,1,I just ordered a small side of fried rice I showed up and it's was $8 which for the location and what I got was extremely high. It has zero flavor all the white sauce in the world couldn't help this rice it's safe to say I won't be back! On a side note ease up on the oil.
10/8/2022,3,"Usually good but... they didn't seem ready to operate. I arrived at the opening time of 12pm on Saturday. There was no ice at the drink station, tables didn't seem greatly cleaned, and took about 20 minutes to get my food. They seemed preoccupied with making a to go order that must have been called in before they opened. Fortunately the food did taste good by the time I got it."
12/5/2021,2,The food was not bad & expensive. I oreded delivery and they forgot to make half the order (didn't forgot to charge me though) when I called they acted like it was an inconvenience for them to fix their error.Don't recommend based on their customer service
3/11/2022,1,"I wish there was an option to rate this place 0 stars because I don't believe it's worthy of even 1 star! I visited this location on Sunday with my boyfriend and some friends. We all ordered our food and within about 5 minutes everyone's food started coming out, besides mine. So I wait another 15 mins go by, still waiting, my friend approached the staff to ask what's going on with my meal, he's told it'll only be a few minutes. Another 15 minutes go by, at this point everyone is almost done with their food. And I'm still waiting for mine, so I go ask the staff what's going on and how much longer it might take. Mind you this whole time they have been filling to go orders and new orders coming in left and right, yet I'm still sitting there 30 minutes later waiting for food! When the food finally arrives we asked the ""manager"" what took so long and she told us they took so long because they were making fresh noodles and filling to go orders. I take 1 bite into my General Tso chicken and noodle bowl to find cold soggy, excessively oily, bottom of the barrel, probably day old noodles! After making me wait more than 30 minutes for my meal they have the nerve to serve me disgustingly old noodles when this whole time they said the hold up was them making ""fresh"" noodles. At this point I don't even have an appetite because of how disgusted I am with their service and the quality of the food. I approached the staff to voice my concerns and was met with attitude from both the guy rolling sushi at the time and the ""manager"". I asked for a refund which they provided with a side of attitude of course. What she should have really done is taken care of the whole bill to compensate for their horrible service. There was no concern, no apology, no explanation, no effort to make things right. The ""manager"" was so annoyed to even be bothered with this issue. And I put the word ""manager"" in quotations because she may have held the title but she was far from what a true manager embodies. I would strongly suggest re training her along with your entire staff on what hospitality is.Please do yourself a favor and don't waste time or your money going here."
9/17/2022,5,Honestly I've never heard of bento until I started  working downtown. I've tried quite a few things but it's overall really great!!
10/18/2021,3,Food is great but service was bad. My children's food came out after I was done with my food. The cashier was new. He didn't know what size the portions were or if I cans substitute anything. I willLook for another place with great food instead of coming here.
5/5/2022,3,"This is a very convenient location for Downtown, but there are some things you should be aware of because it's not quite a ""normal"" Bento location. First, there are no boba-style drinks available--which is a shame, because I'd be here multiple times a week for those. Second, Happy Hour (buy-two, get-one-free sushi, BOGO beer, and free app with kitchen entree) is dine-in only, even though that's not advertised anywhere until after you order. Third, the portions are 10-15% smaller than regular Bento locations. Even though I live less than a block away, I choose the Winter Park Bento more frequently."
5/22/2022,1,"Was sitting outside with my meal and drink, got up to make a phonecall didn't want everyone to hear my conversation. Come back to my table and the worker had threw my food and drinks in the trash. I go inside ask the manager for a replacement not even a refund and she refused. It was about $35 worth of food and drink. Obviously customer service is not their thing."
11/2/2019,4,"I've been to quite a few locations of Bento, so it's high time I wrote a review. This one came in clutch for my and my crew after walking the streets of Downtown Orlando!You order as soon as you walk in the door and the food is brought to you. The food came out quite quickly and it did not disappoint. My food was not as hot as I would have liked this time around, but no serious complaints. The food tasted fresh and is always presented beautifully.Great spot if you are into Asian Fusion. Always a quality meal!"
2/25/2022,4,"The food was 4 stars, the atmosphere 3, so I rounded up from the 3.5 star average that this Bento location fittingly already has on Yelp.My husband, toddler, and I shared a Japanese curry chicken katsu bowl, a Korean tofu bowl (both with brown rice because we like denying ourselves pleasure), and a Florida roll.We were able to enjoy the perfectly-prepared bowls despite the echoey, crowded, and grimey atmosphere (and I know grimey - I have a toddler). The chicken and tofu were perfectly fried, the sauteed vegetables still nicely crisp, and the rice - well, despite it being brown, didn't detract. The Korean bowl wasn't too saucy or spicy (except maybe for the extremely spice-averse), and my husband found the Japanese bowl's green beans excellent. The Florida roll was a little light on the avocado, which it really could have used more of to offset the fish and cream cheese. And actually maybe a little more rice?The atmosphere was more fast-casual than I expected (that one's on me), but maybe class it up with something (environmentally) nicer than giant plastic cups for all beverages, at least for dine-in. My husband and I had to laugh at ourselves drinking sake out of a beer pong-sized plastic cup."
6/20/2021,5,Reasonably priced and consistently delicious sushi. We've always had great experiences in the restaurant and it's one of our reliable go-tos for take- out or delivery.
5/25/2022,5,The bento boxes are great! Great variety of options on the menu and well executed - I highly recommend.
1/22/2020,4,"*this review is based on pick up only*I've ordered from Bentos via their online portal and I really dig it! The menu is easily accessible, down to allowing you to ask for special requests for your order (though they mention it might not be acknowledged). Order has always been ready within 10 minutes which surely beats waiting in line and then waiting for your food afterwards. I'm always acknowledged quickly and have not had to wait more than 5 minutes for my order when I arrived. Still tasty & hot as if I was eating in the restaurant."
5/31/2022,5,This is a great place.It has good food and good Services. They are very clean and nice people.I recommend the garlic broccoli.
11/1/2021,1,I worked today 10/31/21. I went on break and got sushi.I'm now in the hospital because of food poisoning. Absolute worst sushi and even worse service. 0/10 would not recommend.
4/15/2022,2,"Usually their dishes are good. But today, I placed an order to go; sesame stir fry w/shrimp bowl at 2:26pm. Two young ladies ordered after me and received their meals around 10-15 mins after. I had to ask about my meal. I received it 20 mins later. The rice was pasty, no seasoning. JUST BLAND. Wasted $14."
9/20/2019,5,"Bento always delivers! Love the ambiance of this location very chic. I appreciate the consistency and flavors of Bento. Came on a Thursday afternoon and wasn't very busy. Parking can be a nightmare if you don't want to park in the parking garage. Had a bento bowl and the flavors were every bit of amazing. Will continue to frequent. Call ahead for take out, as certain times they get very busy. Metered parking around the corner."
9/15/2021,5,Love all bento locations! We order bento often and it's always delicious ! Many great options of food and teas
4/19/2018,1,"One question...what the heck happened to this place?!?! We are so disappointed. No more table service, they down sized their menu and got rid of a lot of items, the Udon soup had thin, flat noodles and the beef they used almost seemed like mutton. Yuck. Not at all what it should have been. The steamed chicken dumplings were thrown into a bowl and we were given a plastic to go container of the dipping sauce on the side. Food didn't even taste the same. It seems they are pinching pennies at this place wherever they can. We used to love coming here....not anymore. We won't be coming back again."
9/16/2019,4,"One of our favorite lunch spots.  You can smell the appetizing aromas from the street.  Lots of great vegetarian options.  You can have your choice of protein, sauce, veggies over rice or noodles, they have great bento boxes as well.  Another of my favorites are the sushi rolls and most recently the amazing poke bowls.  Very delicious, service is friendly and fast.  Seating is tight at lunch, and occasionally the orders are wrong, but still we love it."
3/11/2022,3,40 minutes and counting for two bento boxes. There are 5 tables with a total of 16 ppl here. It's completely dead.
4/6/2018,4,"Walked past this cafe on my way to walk for the premiere of Orlando Fashion Week 2018, it smelled delicious, which caused me to do a double-take on catching their name. I ended up walking the same path back to my car and smelled the same deliciousness on my return trip. That was my queue that I needed to have dinner there, instantly. After walking in, I checked in on Yelp and noticed they had 400 reviews while sitting at a 4 star rating... that's pretty darn good for me! Let's sushi! On top of that, I received an instant coupon (from checking in) for a free appetizer. For a little café, on a Friday night, the seating was quick! The wait staff pretty swift! And the food was tasty! I ordered, steamed chicken dumplings for my appetizer $FREE; the 4 piece ""Cali"" Sushi $3.50; and the Fried Rice Bowl with Chicken $8. Washed down with a delicious Angry Orchard $3.50It doesn't seem as if that was much but, the portion size of the rice bowl was HUGE more like a deep bowl. I will be returning again... and again... and again when I am back in town."
2/25/2020,4,"Came here for dinner with my husband, service was great, a lot of options on the menu. I ordered Szechuan Chicken bento box and my husband got Pao Pao chicken with Lo Mein noodle bowl. The flavor is great, I would hope the Szechuan chicken can be more spicy but I guess it caters to American taste. Pao Pao creamy sauce was good but a bit too much on the noodles. It would also be nice if they can add more vegetable varieties to the dishes instead of only having steamed broccoli. Bento box was $11 and the bowl was $10, the portion may be a bit small if you came in with an empty stomach. A nice place overall, will come back again to try the sushi box."
5/30/2021,5,"I especially love the tofu and fried rice. The service is fast and friendly, and the prices are good."
6/12/2021,1,"The chicken pad Thai I got was good here but my sister in law ordered a sushi combo box and a gnat came flying out of the container! We ordered for delivery. After calling the restaurant about the situation just to give them a heads up, they offered a free one to replace it. All I had to do was give them my name. When I tried to get the replacement they offered, I was turned away because nobody recalled the offer."
6/19/2017,4,"4 stars for a solid downtown Asian restaurant.I've been to Bento a few times with various people. Located in the Plaza on Orange Avenue next to Mochi and the theater, Bento is a standard Asian restaurant that offers sushi and various rice or noodles + flavored meat combinations.When you arrive, you walk through the door and immediately get into line to order at the counter. Bento has menus off to the side for you to use to order, and the servers bring out your food once it is ready. The interior is fairly clean and modern with techno music playing in the background and a sushi counter looking out to the dining room.When it comes to picking food, you can either order a roll or put together a bowl or box. I usually get the bento box if I'm hungry or he noodle bowl if I just want a snack. The latter comes with ginger salad, a fun dessert, string beans, and noodles/rice with your meat (I like the orange, but they have several good flavors). Priced at around $10 (which gets you a free appetizer as a Yelp check-in deal), it's probably the best combo to get.Overall, Bento is a solid downtown Asian restaurant. The nice interior, good standard Asian food selection, and good deals makes this one of the better (non-sushi) Asian spots in Downtown Orlando."
8/8/2021,4,"This place is hidden. The food was delicious. I had the chicken stir fry rice bowl and fried pork dumplings. The restaurant was clean. Staff friendly. I tried to pay in cash and they wouldn't accept it. You have to use a credit card. Apple Pay, etc. You have to grab a menu at the door when you walk in. Order at the register. They will prompt you for a tip. Just FYI, you seat yourself, get your own drink from the cooler or fountain, you have to go get your napkins and plastic utensils from the back of the restaurant. They bring your food and never come back. No glass of water. I only received half my order. When I was done with my rice bowl I had to go back to the register to inquire about my dumplings. I'm not sure what the tip is for since there is no service. Same deal as Panera. But the food was great and the portions were ver good. I don't agree with this asking for a tip before you get your order and when you have to serve yourself.  You don't get a tip just because you show up for work."
7/8/2019,4,"Good sushi however the Yaki Udon is way too salty. I had to ask them to remake it using less sodium/soy sauce/salt. Way too much salt. Prices are very reasonable and clean interior restaurant.However, don't expect to get any service at all. They bring out your food and never check up on you again. If you need napkins, you have to walk all the way to the cash register for that. If you need a refill on your drink, you have to walk over to the drinks yourself. I wouldn't tip them much."
5/27/2019,3,"I decided to come to downtown Bento location due to convenience for me. I ordered the Szechuan Shrimp with veggies & rice and received a free appetizer for checking in on the yelp app. I chose the wontons. Service: The line was literally out the door. It took about 10 mins to reach the front register. It took about another 15 mins to receive my food. The place was packed shoulder to shoulder. So seating was hard to find, especially if you're in a larger party. Food: I received my wontons about 5 mins before my entree came out. The wontons were more on the crispy side but were delicious with the sauce that came with it. The entree came out hot and steamy! As far as the taste of the food, it was very generic. I felt like I could have randomly chose a random Szechuan sauce from the shelf and had better if not equivalent. The shrimps were nice and juicy and the lunch portion was pretty good in size.. it could easily been separated into 2 meals. Parking: so you have to park in a parking garage and Bento will validate your parking .. just know they only take off $2 and NOT the entire parking fee."
3/1/2019,4,"I'm surprised I have not reviewed Bentos before. This place is the place to thank for my love for sushi. It was my first sushi spot I ever went to. I've been to their location in Dr Phillips as well. The servers are always friendly. This visit I actually checked in and got free wontons! They came out a little over friedand the server had no problem to bring them back. He even stood by while they made fresh ones. It's a nice ambiance. I have since explored several sushi places,and I still enjoyed Bentos!"
12/21/2020,4,Haven't been here in awhile since covid started.the time to get food was slower than the times before but we still enjoyed it.
6/11/2020,4,Love the food but every time we order off yelp there seems to be an issue. Either they can't find it or it takes an additional 30 minutes for our food to be ready.
2/2/2019,4,"Came to Bento with a big party and they were accommodating once most of the party arrived, which is normal. The place is pretty small but clean, and it is downtown, so not a big deal. It was my first time there and the menu looked great. Our server recommended some dishes and I opted for the pineapple chicken with white rice. It came out hot and you could tell it was real white meat chicken, with a tangy pineapple sauce. It was good, not great, not as flavored as I thought it would be but they gave you ALOT of food and it was affordable. I had so much leftovers! Other people in the party ordered their bento boxes, which looked amazing. Next time I will definitely order that. The customer service was excellent and I would be back again and recommend."
5/5/2020,3,"Bento used to be one of my favorite casual restaurants in Orlando due to their large menu and all of the varieties they have. I've been ordering from this restaurant for years, but I've realized that their prices continue to go up while the quality of their food has been decreasing tremendously. My favorite items were the sushi combo box (rainbow roll, mount fuji roll or special mexican with a side of white sauce) and the sriracha garlic chicken with noodles. Last time I ordered, the rolls were extremely small and the chicken was soggy."
1/19/2020,5,Absolutely delicious rolls!  Great little spot downtown to grab a bite and sooth  your sushi roll cravings. Excellent quality. Creative taste combinations. Friendly service. OnE of the best rolls we've ever had.
2/16/2017,3,"Let's start with the good, if you check in with Yelp you can get a free appetizer! They have happy hour from 3-6 from Monday to Friday. The restaurant is rather small so it's difficult to walk around if they place you in a middle table and your basicly sitting with your neighbor.I tried this out with some of my friends for the first time. I was late as always...I can't help it I'm Italian, it's in my blood! Haha. All of my friends already had their food when I got there. I ordered the free app to start, the pork egg rolls. They were good but nothing to rave about. As always when I'm with a group I have a hard time ordering. I decided to opt for the poke bowl with tuna since it had mango and I haven't had mango in forever. So as you know the dish is mostly just cut up cold items since its sushi but it still took them around 25 minutes to finally bring over my dish. Oh and the best part there were only a few small pieces of mango. I'd say an okay experience but I don't think I'd revisit."
7/22/2017,4,"I have been coming to Bento since I moved here to Florida 3 years ago. I worked downtown and this location is in the heart of downtown. Its easily accessed by any club or business downtown.Bento is my go to for a quick meal. I love sushi and the sushi they serve is always delicious. They have many different options of asian food, and the most popular combo is the bento box. It comes with 8 pieces of california, and 2 other rolls of your choice at 4 pieces each!I had a little mishap my last visit, they messed up my order and forgot my appetizers. The manger was apologetic and gave me a $10.00 valture for the next time I visit. I will continue to come to this location and any Bento around the Orlando area!"
4/5/2019,4,"I came here about a week ago with a friend and decided to try it for the first time, the food was good, I don't have any complaints. I would come back on a regular day for lunch"
12/4/2018,4,"I love this chain!What did I getI got the Regular sized build your own poke. I got it with double Salmon (Yes, I love salmon. Got spicy and regular. For the base, you can pick white or brown rice or spring mix, I got the greens. With the regular you can pick 3 different add ins and also 3 toppings with 2 sauces. I got mine with nori, jalapeños, wonton crisps, masago, fried onion.EnvironmentThis location is right downtown by the Cobb Theatre. It is relatively big for its location but can get very crowded during lunch time. I was there around 12 and it got packed.Niceness of the StaffDespite being busy, the staff was very nice. I was able to make my order in a timely manner and the order was brought out to me quickly. I asked for wasabi and they brought it to me quickly! Nice staffDollarThe regular boba was $11. Very reasonably priced.Yes?I love bentos! It is my trusted quick asian chain I love.#WendyWanders"
1/4/2019,4,"Consistent and a downtown Orlando lunch staple. Since I switched jobs to an office downtown, Bento has become a regular spot for me to grab a quick, affordable bite to eat. FOOD: Japanese/Asian cuisine. I usually order off their sushi menu, but in the event I am not feeling like it, I know their restaurant-side food is still good. Bento offers a wide variety of food. Their menu has two sides to it! If anything, their food is also very consistent and rarely do I have issues with the order itself.ATMOSPHERE: Fast casual. I wouldn't come to Bento for an intimate date, especially during the lunch hour where the line stretches through the dining area. You order and grab a table before the servers bring you your food.SERVICE: It is usually good, but every once in a while, I get someone who is completely clueless (so I chalk it up to them being new) or just apathetic about getting the orders brought to you timely. For example, a friend, who had ordered before me, got their meal after me because the server running the food did not check the window. Our sauces came out wrong too, but thankfully, that was an easy fix.Like I said, I come here pretty frequently, so Bento, please don't change.TIPS:- Get to Bento before 11:45 a.m. on weekdays to avoid a hefty lunch line.- Check in on Yelp for a deal.- Coca Cola products are served here."
1/31/2017,4,"Whenever I go to bento I am never disappointed. They have the best rice bowls, or sushi! I recommend picking either or because if you get both your bill will be a little higher than usual- and you will be stuffed!!! I love their sweet and sour chicken with white rice and you can never go wrong with any type of sushi. I always end up taking my rice bowl home because it is a lot of food. For the price you pay, id say the amount of food you get is fair! I will be back here soon to get my sushi kick!"
12/8/2019,5,"Their food was very tasty and fresh, I tried the soy poke sauce on a tuna poke bowl and it was very well balanced  with the rest of the bowl, I can't wait to try more of their menu. The young lady at the register was very nice and polite and asked all the right questions to get our order right, we were very happy with our bowls and will be coming back next time we are in the area The atmosphere was very upbeat, I wish we had had a chance to stay but had to travel and were there just to return our rental car."
1/2/2019,4,"I love this spot i used to come here a lot back in my Glory college days. It's a great spot to grab something to eat before going to the movies, or bar hopping. The food is pretty inexpensive and absolutely delicious. The staff is always willing to help and seem to be very knowledgeable. Bento is always our first choice when we are in downtown Orlando"
3/11/2019,5,"Love this place! It's fast, food service, tasty sushi, and good affordable prices! Favorite rolls are the special Mexican, Mt. Fuji, and dragon fly!"
12/9/2019,4,Bento has a good selection of bowls and are reasonably priced. The Korean chicken noodle bowl was good. Portion sizes are good. Lunch at Orlando downtown location can be crowded depending on the lunch time rush. Always a good go to for sushi and noodle bowls.
7/2/2018,3,"Ate here twice with my friends after rehearsals. Both times we sat in the booth against the long window since we were a group of 5-8 depending on the time. The food is cooked to order, the veggies are fresh and the rice is good. I ordered the Broccoli garlic beef the first time and a noodle dish the 2nd, both times the food was fast and delish!"
1/5/2019,3,"***Update: The management followed up about the experience, which I really do appreciate. The food was OK. The regular udon noodles are the best thing to have in a bowl. The two stars mainly come from The customer service because it was below par honestly. I called ahead, and they didn't put the order in until I got there 20 minutes later. Additionally, they got the order wrong. They did apologize, but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth unfortunately. I usually enjoy going to Bento, so it might have been a one-time thing."
7/6/2020,5,Love the fried rice and the cream cheese rangoons they were always great no matter the location
10/11/2019,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOOOVE This is on my top 5 fave places to eat. The bento box is the best option. My faves are the Bulgolgi and the Yellow or Red Curry. Their sushi is also AMAZING. highly recommend the TNT roll. Great food at great prices. Can't go wrong here.
8/11/2016,4,"I have now been to Bento twice... once for lunch and once for dinner. The first time I went, I was able to try an assortment of sushi. Myself and two co-workers each got a roll and split it all the way around. Some sushi was better than others, but everything was very good. I will go ahead and admit that I am being a bad Yelper and not remembering what rolls I have tried. But with any sushi, if I don't do a picture and caption then, it is lost on me looking back. For a lunch place, it is a great spot to stop in and get sushi. The atmosphere didn't feel as much that way for dinner. Maybe it was the really close quarters or maybe the rowdy group next to us downing the sake special like it was penny beer night. But not exactly what we were looking for a night of sushi with just my wife and me. The sushi was still very good and I would not be opposed to coming back. But if I am looking for a nice, relaxing dinner, we might try somewhere else. They still get the 4 stars because the food is worth coming in for."
11/4/2019,3,"Quick, convenient spot downtown to satisfy some Asian food cravings. I love its variety especially for when you're in a big group or don't know exactly what you're craving til you get there. The bento box is good if you can't decide even when you get there. It has salad, a carb, your choice of meat, and a couple pieces of sushi. It's your classic fast food Asian place - not the highest quality but still satisfying."
10/20/2020,3,Stopped by for a quick meal with my brother. This was my first time there. The food was decent. I found it a bit expensive for what it was and for the fact that it's cafeteria style. The veggies were good but the pasta was cold. Don't think I'll go back there.
3/30/2021,3,The venue is always kept nice and neat. The food and prices are good. The wait time isn't long even when they are busy during lunch.
8/11/2019,5,I usually get one of their bowls with Pao Pao sauce which is a creamy spicey sauce which is great on chicken or shrimp.   Their edamame is tasty with Garlic being my favorite.   Poke bowls are a solid choice here as well and the fish as always been fresh. It can be tricky to find as the main entrance is in the hallway under the movie theatre when going from orange ave towards the parking garage/entrance to the Solaire.  It is on the east side of the Plaza building.Yelp PRO TIP: as of this writing they have a FREE appetizer with every check-in!
8/20/2018,5,I can't believe I've never left a review for Bento! I am a check in regular and love this place. I love that they offer a free appetizer when you check in. The food is always consistently delicious and for the location the pricing is very affordable. I love going here after the movies and sometimes come in for lunch. I've even ordered delivery and my orders are always very accurate. I always order the special Mexican roll with bento fried rice with steak and shrimp. The bento box with spicy cream chicken is another favorite and I have trouble choosing between them. Bento is a franchise but still a local franchise and I love it!
8/22/2021,1,I used to love you guys but for some reason you don't take cash anymore. Which is weird I work downtown at a busy place and we take cash but you are definitely losing customers for not taking cash if you fix that you might be busier
7/26/2016,4,"Chain restaurant that is definitely worth a visit. Everytime I go there I get something good and I try something else that I want to get next time. Curry (yellow) Katsu great, sweet spicy cream really good!!The service is good and I love the vibe plus they get your food to you in a timely fashion. Good prices as well."
4/12/2018,5,"I don't know if I'm giving this place 5 stars because they have out-frigging-standing customer service or the food or both. First, I walked into the restaurant and I was seated in a nice comfortable booth. I noticed they had about ten or so people working the floor. You have an assigned waiter / waitress, but if you even look like you have a concern someone is bolting over to offer their help. I'm going to be honest it impressed me - a lot. This man saw a confused look on my face and asked if he could help. He recommended certain items and explained the pricing. His recommendations were spot on and I was glad I ordered the item he suggested. I was quite hungry and my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Later, I was considering ordering an additional item and I expressed concerns with my waitress that I might be ordering too much. She honestly agreed that the size of the rolls were going to be too big for me to finish other items. I was so impressed with her honesty most waiters try to get you to order as much as possible to increase their tip, but their waitress Kimberly was fair and honest - I love it!The general atmosphere of this place is awesome. You can go alone like I did, bring a date or a friend or your family. The seating is comfortable enough that you can box your kids into a booth and have a good dinner without them running off.I like this place. I love their customer service.Their sushi is above average especially for Orlando.They have spicy mayo most places in Orlando do not. The prices vs portion size is excellent!"
7/30/2019,5,"Love this bento box style! Wish we had this place in California. Choose your choice of meat then pair to a dish and it comes with side dishes (rice, salad, and chow menu). I have got to say their kung pao chicken was the best out of what I have tried besides my red curry beef."
11/27/2017,4,"Pretty great spot that was close to the air bnb we stayed. We liked how the way to order is similar to Pei Wei. I ordered the Mongolian Steak Rice bow with white rice. Fresh crisp veggies and tender meat, but I get the flavor lacked something. I still enjoyed my dish though. The crab wonton appetizer is like at any other place, but the dipping sauce is spicy vs the typical sweet n sour kinda sauce. The interior is pretty with the lights that have grey or black threads hanging down from the lights. The tables seem a bit too close together and would be difficult to maneuver through. So definitely get a booth if you can. They had pumpkin wontons too, but I think it may only be for a limited time for the fall season. I'd like to come back and get sushi next time!"
10/16/2017,4,"Timing is everything.  This place is quite popular with our friends and the one thing we all agree on is TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  You can come here at the right time and you'll buzz through the line.  You can come here at the wrong time and it will take forever.If you work, live, or play downtown a lot you will figure it out for Bento Café fairly easily.My wife's favorite here is their poke.  The location is convenient (especially if you're hitting a movie at Plaza or are downtown for lunch) and the prices are fairly reasonable.  The quality of the food is good and the service is solid.It is one of the better Asian downtown restaurants."
9/8/2019,5,"I loveeeeee Bento! To be honest I live within walking distance from my apartment to this location and probably come 2 times a week with my boyfriend. What we both like about it is the consistency; every time we go the staff is friendly (one of the girls at the register knows my order  as soon as I come in), the food is always fresh and the orders come out quick. The special mex roll is the best sushi I've ever had and the General TSO box is my boyfriend's favorite. I took my mom here from Tampa and she is obsessed and is patiently waiting for the Tampa location to open. I would give Bento 5 more stars if I could!"
8/27/2019,4,"Nice lunch spot if you are in the mood for a quick sushi/ noodle, poke or bento.  Very busy and popular. I enjoyed what I ordered but I'm more traditional sushi person. I did order build a poke bowl with Salmon, but I'm not a big poke fan. I do recommend if you are on a budget and short on time. You won't be disappointed. Lots of menu options."
8/3/2018,4,"I love Bento! I've always gone here for one main goal. To devour a spicy chicken bento box! I have had the sushi and I do appreciate it but the spicy chicken bento is so good that I literally never deviate from that order. This Bento is located under the Cobb theater in the heart of downtown! It's pretty convenient if your watching a movie. The service is quick and everyone is really nice. This is a downtown location so it is a little noisy. The bathrooms and insides were clean and I did appreciate that. I know it's hard, especially downtown. The bento box is what I always get so that is what I'm going to review, with the exception of two appetizers that I ordered last time, the crab rangoon's and the pork egg rolls. Bento boxThis comes with a scoop of white rice, lo mein, ginger salad, dessert crisps in the middle (with a sweet drizzle of what seems to be condensed milk), and of course, the main protein choice. Here's the thing, the spicy chicken isn't even spicy. Just delicious, hold the spice. It does come with pepper bits, both red and green scattered throughout. I eat everything because it's all so good. The spicy cream sauce is sweet and tangy, it just distinguishes itself as a good flavor that isn't replicated well. The chicken is crisp and the all white meat inside is begging to be eaten! The crab rangoon's were very good. Sweet but not to sweet. The pork egg rolls I liked a lot. They were very crisp and the veggies inside were steaming! The sauce included was very tasteful as well. Overall, another good experience at Bento! If your spending at least $10, which usually you will, be sure to check in on yelp for a FREE appetizer!"
8/18/2015,4,"I must say I was surprised, I really enjoyed this place. My friends and I stopped by Bento Cafe after the Margarita Fest. The location is great, it is close to almost everything downtown.There was not a long wait for a Saturday night, which was a positive thing for our party of 4. I liked the fact the menu had a wide selection of food for sushi lovers and non sushi lovers. So if you don't like or do not want to have sushi you can order a Bento box which consist of your choice of wok stir fry rice (plenty to choose from), ginger salad and string beans. I ordered the chicken garlic soy Bento Box and it was good. I was also able to redeem a yelp offer because of checked in an ordered the fried chicken dumplings.I had an overall great experience; the service was on point and definitely recommend this place if you are downtown and want to grab a quick bite."
6/7/2019,3,"2.5 stars upped to a 3. Used to be my go to spot. However I think I have had my last meal there.Brought a group of friends out of tradition. But downsizing to fast casual really takes the experience down a few notches. Average food and zero service. A downgraded experience for sure. Plenty of sushi places if you're looking for a good meal. If you're looking for a quick lunch, maybe? If you're looking for a nice dinner, this is not the spot."
3/25/2019,1,"I live DT and this place used to be my go-to. Ever since they went to self-service (without changing the prices) it's just no longer worth it. They could get away with mediocre sushi if the service was good, but standing in line and ordering, taking a plastic number to your table... hard to justify spending money here. The line on the receipt for a tip is an insult. As a principle I tip 25% or better, but asking for a tip before you've had food or service is gross.I ordered a poke bowl, a roll, some hot sake, and the ""matcha minis"" (a desert). First to show up at the table was the desert, then the bowl. 20 minutes later the roll, and had to ask twice for sake. Service is abysmal, food is mediocre. You are losing customers over your greed."
9/25/2019,5,"The place have good menu selection, friendly stuff and fast service. Food is tasty, the portion size is good for the price. Poke bowl (you can build yourself and chose the size of the meal) is my favorite there."
10/9/2020,1,"We used to love this place, have been customers for years but lately the service has been terrible.  We just picked up food here and asked specifically for silverware and the snarky dude who waited on my husband smiled and said, why yes, there is silverware in the bag.  We were not going home so we got to eat with our fingers.  This was after my husband had trouble with his Apple Pay and the same dude looked at him and said ""you know there is an app for that"" like he was ignorant.  You would think that at a time when many restaurants are dying customers would least expect to be treated like this but I guess not.  Go to another Bento, I can almost guarantee you will be treated better."
12/19/2019,3,"We were referred to Bento by a lot of locals - overall, the food is good. It isn't great but it's not bad. That being said, I ordered the Wok Fried Rice with Shrimp. I added hot chili oil to give it that extra flavor. Next, I ordered the Hot Lava and Bamboo rolls. I wasn't that impressed but it's good."
8/15/2015,4,"Sushi was great--5 star! Service was lacking--2 star. Luckily the food was good enough to over rule the poor service (and hopefully it was just our server who was bad).Definitely come during their happy hour (3-6pm) because their special is amazing-- buy 2 rolls get 1 free (or something like that). They have standard sushi roll selection. We ordered caterpillar and spider rolls which were both fairly tasty. They also have sushi bowls with sashimi, rice, avocado, cucumber, and seaweed. We created our own bowl with salmon, tuna, and krab (imitation crab meat). Definitely recommend getting the salmon!"
9/14/2017,1,"Vegans & Vegetarians DO NOT EAT HERE! IHad ordered a tofu bento box and they had pieces of meat mixed in my veggies and tofu. I told the waiter and he said he was going to tell the manager, but noone came to apolognize nor offer another plate. I will never eat here again nor recommend this place to ANYONE. DISAPPOINTED."
4/30/2020,5,My go to for fast sushi in Orlando. It's always tasty and delicious. Great presentation and fast service. My two faves are the Mt. Fuji and Special Mexican. Love their Pao Pao chicken too!
8/24/2019,5,"This is my absolute favorite sushi place! I've only ever come during lunch, but the Sushi Bento Box is so satisfying and delicious, even when you get take-out. The sushi is fresh, tasty, well made and I always enjoy every bite!"
3/3/2017,4,"Anyone who knows me, knows my love for Asian food. Went out to the magic game tonight and decided to stop by Bento since it is near the Amway center. It has been a long time since I've been here but remember how much I enjoyed their food. I'm glad I did because it's just as good as I remembered it. To start off we ordered a Mexican roll as an appetizer. It came cut in 8 pieces and we split it between the both of us. It was delicious. The inside was warm and the cream cheese blended perfectly with the tempura shrimp. Add some eel sauce and it was delicious. I checked my yelp app and checked in and to my surprise had a free appetizer with 10 dollar purchase. They don't have many options but we decided on the krab rangoons. They were just fried when they got to the table so they very a little oily but flavor wise they were OK. They have many different options for entrees. You can either do a rice or noodle bowl with choice of meat ( chicken, beef, shrimp) or you can do a Bento box which brings rice, noodles, green beans, salad and your choice of protein. It literally comes in a box that has little dividers for each food. We both decided on getting the Bento box. I ordered the orange chicken and my girlfriend ordered the schezwan chicken. My box was delicious. I'm not a fan of green beans so I didn't touch those ( should of asked if I was allowed a replacement). The rice and noodles were perfect for my orange chicken. If I wanted to be picky I could of used less orange sauce on my chicken. Seemed to be a lot of it and it was very flavorful. The noodles went well with the chicken and so did the white rice. Salad had ginger dressing which tasted very refreshing. The schezwan chicken could have used more chicken as a lot of it was vegetables. My gf also complained that it had too much sauce. Overall we had a delightful experience. For 9 dollars per Bento box you get a lot of food and have the option of so many different types of meat. 2 Bento boxes, an appetizer, 1 sushi roll and 2 drinks all came out to $29.00 which in my eyes is a good deal. Make sure to redeem the free appetizer coupon!!"
3/7/2017,4,"Bento is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown.  I've been coming here since 2012.  Bento is conveniently located in the heart of downtown under the movie theater. You can basically make any entree a combo ($3 up-charge) which includes a drink and a salad, edamame, or miso soup. I rotate between a Bento box, the orange chicken rice bowl, and the  and tuna poké bowl. If you're starving, go with the bento box; it's very filling. The orange chicken has good flavor but the breading is heavy. My chicken gets a little soggy after a while. Make sure if you go with the Poké bowl you get a side of the teriyaki sauce -- perfect sweet and salty sauce."
7/16/2019,1,"Came to this place at lunch, what a disappointment the food was horrible, the noodles were cold the rice was under cooked, the chicken tasted horrible extremely sweet and cold as well. Ask for the free appetizer that they offer with Yelp check in, they refuse to honor it. They don't even have napkins on the table. Zero customer service. This is one of the places in downtown Orlando with four stars that are terrible. Not coming to this place in the future. With so many choices I don't find a reason to eat at this restaurant."
9/8/2020,1,"Are you serious tables are disgusting no ones cleaning them, food takes forever and get this the foutain isnt working but you can buy a $2.00 can of soda i cant even deal with the horrible service its no wonder all the concepts are closing that they own"
7/3/2017,5,Update....   We went back to have some Sushi last night.  Everything we ordered was super good.  Our waitress was nice.  We were very satisfied w/our experience here. Very reasonable price and fresh fish! Their ginger salad is pretty good! I love their Kawaii rolls!  And of course their create your own bowl is super good! Thank you to Tammy for your support!
11/17/2019,1,"This place has changed for the worst unfortunately. There's no more table service so you have to order at the register. They used to have some decent wine now they only have Pinot noir and Moscato. I mean who drinks Moscato!! And that's there only white wine option!! Also they don't have booster chairs anymore only high chairs, the hot sake was barley warm, also all the soy sauces at the tables were about empty. I am over this place. Bye Felicia!!!!"
10/29/2018,5,Where do I even begin!!! I absolutely love this place the location is perfect and the food just delivers every time. I went to lunch here on Saturday and I enjoyed myself. I was craving Asian food and and I was downtown so this was perfect. I like the ambience of the restaurant and surprisingly it wasn't too crowded. During lunch you order at the register then grab a number and choose your own seat which I like doing that anyway. I have the bangin bento fried rice which shrimp! And let me tell you the shrimp were not no baby shrimp these were juicy big shrimp which gave the rice soo much flavor!! Ok so I was really hungry so I ordered more lol I also also had the miso soup which was perfect! Also I ordered the fried pork dumplings which were crispy the way I like and juicy inside. Wait I'm not done! I also ordered the spicy tuna rolls which were put together small and cute the way I like I can't stand big sushi rolls that fall a part so they nailed it!! I loved all my food and I am looking forward to my next visit!
1/21/2017,4,"My husband and I frequent this place on our lunch breaks.When you walk in there are laminated menus to your right. They offer sushi rolls, lunch specials, rice and noodle bowls and some traditional appetizers.Once you decide what you want you order at the counter and pay.  If you choose to dine in they will give you a number to place on your table.  You get to pick where you'd like to sit. They have a fountain drinks all the way in the back, where you can find extra napkins, to go containers and forks.   They also offer beer and specialty drinks in the front to the left of the counter.This place is a great option for a quick bite.  Just keep in mind, if you order sushi it does take longer to come out than if you were to order a rice or noodle bowl.There have been many occasions where my husband got his rice bowl about five minutes before I got my sushi."
12/8/2018,3,"Went here on a cold day, ordered soup with beef in it. It was very flavorful, but didn't really have any vegetables in it. It would have been nice to have some bok choy, more bean sprouts, maybe some bamboo, or some other greens in it. Other than that. It was good."
6/21/2016,4,"Let's just skip right to the important part: The chirashi bowl is $11.95.That's right ladies and gentlemen, there exists a place smack in the middle of downtown Orlando that offers a chirashi bowl for $11.95, when the vast majority of restaurants charge somewhere in the range of $16 to $25.  Now I know what you're thinking, ""Yes but surely this 'chirashi bowl' is filled with... like, Cheerios and string cheese."" Not so!In the interest of full disclosure, one can safely (and correctly) assume that this chirashi bowl may not be as good as some of those high priced works of art. But it's got all of the basics!  Good, fresh fish: tuna, escolar, salmon, yellowtail, two pieces each. A couple of pieces of fake crab meat, shrimp, and several slices of cucumber and avocado. All of this on top of a bed of sushi rice with a little seaweed salad in the corner.It's not as big as some of the chirashi I've had, and it's not as adventurous as some others. But it's a good, basic chirashi for a totally reasonable price."
11/5/2016,5,"Got off a cruise and came over for some happy hour sushi and bentos box. It was just right. Bogo on beer and wine, pick 2 signature rolls and get a classic roll free. The portions were filling and the sushi was presented nicely."
5/5/2016,3,"Why 3 stars? Because this was definitely a prototypical average experience.   ---   ---   ---This is what 3-star reviews were made for. A bunch of co-workers and I gathered here for a lunch during a conference. Put a bunch of Yelp CM's in a room, and you're likely to get one helluva of a family-style, sharing experience. And share we did, with too many sushi rolls to count.The only draw back to family-style sharing, is the chaos of food flying at you from every direction, which makes it tough to pen a review with a ton of specifics. Here's what I know - maybe one roll out of the several that I tried was pretty good. The rest ranged from eh, to meh. How's that for a scientific explanation?I can understand patronizing here if you have an office nearby and are craving sushi for lunch, but I can't personally see going out of my way to return, to be totally honest."
2/16/2019,4,Went in for a quick bite since everything else in the area was closed (2pm on Saturday). Ordered a mini poke bowl. Everything was good and was a great portion for a quick lunch.
12/4/2019,4,"The restaurant is kinda hidden downtown but I've found it twice!!! Both times the food was amazing!!! Only reason I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is lacking. They don't seem enthused to be working here, and we were a table of 4, everyone received their food one at a time except for me. I had to wait an additional 15 min for my food and I wasn't told why I had to wait, by the time I received my food, the rest of my table was almost done eating. I would have preferred if someone told me the reason why I was waiting for so long. I will return because the food was really good, hopefully the service gets better."
12/30/2016,3,"Small portions on the Bento box, but the food was good. I ordered a spicy tuna, the fish was fresh but they were stingy with the spicy mustard. The restaurant was not busy but service was slow with the food and check."
4/15/2016,4,"This year for our regional confrence we had small lunch groups. This was designed to give us a better chance to connect with our co-workers we only see a few times a year. Of course we threw the rules out the window and 2 of the groups ended up here - which actually accounted for more than half of the team haha --- so what was to be a small lunch turned into a family affair.I went with:Florida Roll - tuna, salmon, cream cheese, avocado, scallions, masagoMexican Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, topped with shrimp, eel sauce, spicy mayoBoth rolls were super solid - and the pieces that I snagged from my table-mates were also really good.The atmosphere here is very different from a ""traditional Japanese/sushi restaurant"". It's modern, large, loud....it's basically fast casual sushi - which is fine, especially for the area they are in. I do want to mention that they had super nice staff. From the girl that took our order, to the young lady cleaning the soda machines, everyone was super nice."
11/1/2019,5,Yummy yummy in my tummy. Bento make me wanna eat everything and look like a gummy. Don't be a dummy and eat crummy. Come to bento and let's get chummy.
11/17/2019,1,This place has gone from a 10 for my family and I to a 1! Happy hour is horrible now. It's now self service at the same price!! They no longer have white wine for my wife. All they have is Moscotto and Pinot Noir (which the cashier called Peanut newer lol). My family enjoys going out to dinner and paying our hard earned money so we can relax and enjoy a meal together.  I have now spent more time in the line to order than actually sitting with my family!  I am done with this place.  It's a shame
6/16/2020,1,"I ordered a side of mixed veggies (among other things) through Uber eats. They tasted like chemicals and there was no seasoning. I rinsed them with water and they tasted okay, but how gross. Why are you sending out unwashed vegetables without any seasoning?"
3/24/2019,5,High Quality Food with Great Service. We love the Bento Chain and this location was no exception. No wait on a late Saturday afternoon and the food came out perfect! It was a great addition to our farmer's market walk. 10/10 would go again.  Our only comment would be that this location did not have boba tea which we missed but there was a boba shop right next door.
4/27/2018,4,2018 Review 35/100Have a taste for sushi? You can't go wrong with Bento. They may not have the best sushi in town but it's always fresh and fast and the service is good. I'm particularly fond of their build-your-own Poke bowls. So many great options for building the perfect bowl. A great option for happy hour (2-4-1 wine) to grab a quick bite before catching a movie at the theater next door.
1/28/2021,2,"To-Go order: My visit tonight was very unpleasant. My order was placed online and was supposed to be ready at 8:08pm. Upon entering, I let them know I was picking up an order. The staff member checked and told me that they didn't have that order and asked if it was under another name. She checked and came back a few minutes later and asked if I was at the correct location. I assured her that I was showing her my order verification and after verifying the address she proceeded to go to the back and I then said my order number. I WAS NEVER ASKED FOR MY ORDER NUMBER and I'm not sure what question would have came next if I didn't mention it. She then stated that there was a mix up in the order and it only came to the ""tablet."" I was not sure what that meant but she stated that the kitchen staff would make it as quick as they can. I waited until 8:29 and I asked the staff member at the counter for an update on my order. This was not a great experience, and nothing was offered, nobody gave updates on my order, no apology. Just nothing...I got my food at 8:31 and walked out of the establishment. Only to find a parking ticket on my car for being in a parking spot for longer than 15 minutes. What an evening....."
5/31/2018,5,"Bento Cafe is a great spot downtown to get a balanced, filling meal that tastes amazing! Have you ever had a bento box? You pick a protein and sauce, brown or white rice, and lo mein noodles, with a salad and green beans. It's so delicious and only costs around $10. If you check in on Yelp you also get a free Appetizer with your purchase!"
2/12/2016,3,"I have mixed feelings about this place. That was probably obvious as soon as you saw the three stars at the beginning of my review. Bento has some yays and nays.Let's start with the yays. The location is superb. They're located right under the Cobb movie theater downtown, and it's convenient place to grab a bite to eat before or after a movie. You can literally just walk upstairs to the movie theater instead of timing your meal so you have time to walk from wherever else you happen to be eating. Another yay: the decor is nice. It has a modern feel to it but doesn't feel hipsterish or pretentious. In other words, as a man without a beard and/or man-bun, I feel comfortable here.The food is where we start to get into mixed territory between yay and nay. I'll call this area schmay. The food is good but not great. They give you decent sized portions and there is a wide variety of food to choose from between sushi platters and stir fry bowls. The variety is nice, but the food itself is just ok. It's good if you're just filling up before a movie, but it's not a place I'd recommend if you're looking for some really good Asian fusion food in Orlando. It's not gross, it gets the job done, the prices are fair, but nothing really elevates it to, ""HOLY CRAP YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE"". Now is the part for the nays. I've eaten here about four or five times now, and each time, it has taken a long time to get seated. Not because they're overcrowded but because it takes forever for someone to notice that I've been standing at the, ""Please Wait To Be Seated"" sign for over five minutes. I hate nitpick on something like this because I like to think I'm a patient person, but I don't think having an employee manning the host position is too much to ask for instead of waiting for a random waiter to notice that me standing there. Once seated, the service becomes better. Tonight, our waitress was very attentive and the food came out fairly quickly. In previous visits, it took what seemed like an eternity for the food to come out. I shouldn't complain about that because good food takes time, but what you get doesn't really justify the wait. Pro-tip: If you're eating here before a movie, ask for the check along with your meal. That way, you can get that out of the way as soon as possible so when you're done eating, you can get to your movie on time instead of waiting around for your bill and your receipt. They're usually pretty good about that as long as you let them know ahead of time that you're on a schedule. If Bento can step up their game when it comes to customer service and unique, quality dishes, I'd totally be willing to cheerlead for this place to become an Orlando ""must-go"" spot. As of now, it's just a good filling station before I see a movie downtown. It's definitely not bad, but it's not great."
1/11/2019,5,"The bento in sand lake gives local discounts to universal employees! It's only ten percent but seriously, it's such a nice thing they do. I love restaurants that help support other local workers. Also their sushi is amazing. I've also had their red curry with tofu and that's the bomb. Their crab Rangoon's are great and so are their spring rolls. Miso soup is awesome too. Everything on their menu is great."
2/12/2016,3,"Three stars for food that's not bad (and often times a solid B+) and convenient for a bite before a movie. And my update with a higher rating is because they reached out and invited me back to try it again, which is pretty awesome customer service. While the visit was definitely better, the food was still just ""good"", without being all that great. That being said, with the convenience and reasonable prices, I'll still come back if I'm hungry before a movie and have already parked in the building's lot.Pro tip: if you're dining before a movie and you see the restaurant crowded, ask for your check with your food because getting the check can sometimes take a bit long when there's a rush. And the portions are large so if, like me, you always have leftovers- ask for a box along with your food, too. (and then be a jerk and send your husband to go put it in the car while you stroll up to the movie theater... not that I've done that...)"
1/6/2019,5,Just went today and ordered 2 sushi rolls and both tasted amazing!! Very satisfied and fresh!! Wish there was a happy hour on Sunday but I understand.
7/8/2016,4,"Enrique, is an amazing first time,only 1 year working, not trained server but with the passion and proactive reaction of a well seasoned amazing server. The food is consistently wonderful. It pleases all the senses."
11/5/2018,5,"Loved my food. Ordered the Zombie roll, a California roll and the garlic edemame. Everything was fresh and tasty. I would definitely visit again."
12/9/2019,5,"Bentos is a chain restaurant that originated in Gainesville. Consistent across all stores and they have a great variety of Japanese and Thai dishes. If you're undecided of what to eat and want a good variety, go here and get a bento box."
5/16/2020,5,Omg I freakin love to build my own Poke Bowl and it turns out so delicious  Their chicken  and steak  teriyaki are both so yummy! Also love the shrimp tempura with spicy mayo! Omg posting this review makes me want to go again tomorrow lol
7/14/2018,5,"Shawn provided excellent service - quick, attentive, knowledgeable & courteous! The food was also great, per usual. We'll definitely be back soon."
10/9/2017,5,"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service. Cole was my server last night and he was outstanding! I was there for quite a bit taking care of some paperwork since I just moved in to the building upstairs from this location. I'm super happy that it's right downstairs! The menu selection and prices are amazing so I look forward to being a regular here. I hadn't given his place much of a chance before since I'm not into sushi, but they have several options that are available vegetarian. Highly recommended. Try the crab rangoons too for sure!"
8/8/2018,5,"Staff is always friendly, they work very fast & the establishment is very clean! I love the sriracha garlic chicken :)"
8/30/2015,4,"4 Stars for a solid pre-movie meal in an ideal location!Bento is my go-to for a quick meal before a movie. The space is a bit cramped, but I actually like the way it makes it clear you're in the city. I know a bunch of reviews mention that the food can take some time, but if you talk to the server first they'll let you know that the sushi rolls may take a bit more time but the bento boxes are very quick to come out! I always order the bento box and am never disappointed. It is like a perfect little TV dinner but MUCH better than what you can get in the frozen aisle (get that meatloaf out of here!). The box comes with a side salad, green beans, your protein choice, rice, and a dessert. I've never finished it all so you're getting a great value for your money too!First you pick the flavor, then the protein. I usually go with the wonderfully savory Mongolian sauce with chicken or the Yellow Curry sauce with tofu. Both are great choices (particularly if you don't care for much spice). Just to reiterate- if you're catching a movie within the hour, make sure to let your server know. If you only have half an hour, you should probably just grab a bite in the theater. I don't think it's reasonable to expect to be seated, order, get food, eat, and pay in less time.Can't wait for my next date night!"
10/24/2018,2,"When I called for delivery they left me on hold for 25 minutes and never answered. While we waited for them to get back to us on the phone I ended up using my husbands phone to place an online order. We could not order nigiri or sake through the online service. We placed an order anyway because my husband really wanted a specific dish. When the food finally arrived 2 hours after being placed, they missed 2 dishes. Not only did they keep changing the deliver times but they forgot the Volcano roll AND the sauce for the Katsu dish, which is the one dish my husband wanted. For these reasons I give this place 2 stars."
11/8/2015,5,I love Bento! I've been there several times and always order the Sushi Bento Box (which comes with their delicious seaweed salad). My favorite rolls are the special Mexican and the Mount Fuji! I definitely recommend them! Their spring rolls with the sweet Thai chili sauce is a great starter (which you can get for free if you check in!!) It's one of the few good sushi places downtown. I will definitely be back! :)
6/6/2019,2,"Really disappointed with my most recent Bento visit. I used to love it here and was excited to go back, unfortunately I will not be going back again. Usually it's packed, this time it was empty. You have to order before sitting down and have to pay when you order, this makes sense in an area that's busy and looking for take out but not when you want to sit, drink and enjoy yourself. They also ask for tip... like who am I tipping and how do I have any idea how the service is going to be. If I wanted more then 1 drink I would have to either buy them all at once or go up each time to purchase another one. On top of the new ordering they were out of all the good saki(it was midweek too). Food was eh, came out quickly yes but the noodles were over cooked and soggy. The whole experience was disappointing, not sure how they are going to stay in business in this particular location the way it's going now."
4/24/2016,4,"I use to be somewhat of a regular here, but I haven't been in over a year or so. Even so I've had good experiences here. My friend's and I decided to come here right before the Orlando Pride game. I usually do not venture from their sushi rolls (good fusion sushi), but decided to this time. I was pleasantly surprised with my order of the Spicy Tuna Salad. It was a bed of field greens with cucumber, avocado (delicious on everything), seaweed salad, tuna (with spicy mayo over it), and a ginger dressing on the side ($9). Two of my friends had sushi, which they enjoyed. And the other had a Thai fried rice bowl with chicken... he liked it, but I don't think he was in love with it.The service was good. The food came out in reasonable time. All in all, a good experience once again!"
8/6/2015,4,"My wife and I were in downtown Orlando late one evening and have not had any dinner.  I had heard about Bento and decided to give it a try.  A good sign was that the place was absolutely packed.My wife will not eat sushi, but I am all in.  She checked out the menu before we asked to be seated, and was pleasantly surprised that they do offer other selections besides sushi. I had one of their bento boxes of sushi for $9.95.  Great value if you don't know your way around the different types of sushi rolls.  Mine came with the California roll, the Tampa roll, and some sort of a spicy Mexican roll.  It was absolutely delicious.I remember tasting my wife's dish, two was very good.  This is definitely one of those places that I will return to.  When you check in on Yelp!, they have a free appetizer offer with a $10 purchase.Definitely worth a try, if you're not familiar with sushi, be adventurous and give it a whirl.  You will not regret it."
9/2/2017,5,"I'm hooked on Bento Cafe!!! I have walked by this place hundreds of times and it wasn't until recently I decided to give it a shot. I have eaten here 3 days in a row and I'm in no way complaining. This is a great place for a quick, affordable meal. I have tried multiple items on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite is the ""build your own poke bowl"" they give you plenty of options and all of the ingredients are always fresh. The staff is always friendly and make sure to provide a laid back atmosphere."
9/2/2017,1,"Poor service from start to finish. We arrived to Bento around 7:00, it was moderately busy for a Friday night. There was a couple ahead of us, we all waited patiently to be greeted, took about 2 minutes for someone to acknowledge them & to be seated. There was zero acknowledgment of us by the host & we stood for another solid 2 minutes for our party of 4 to be greeted & sat.Our server was a young blonde boy, friendly enough. He took our order, we were unable to order just a plain side of fried rice, a protein had to accompany the rice. Odd. Not the end of the world, we adjusted the amount of sushi we ordered each to share the rice.The food took FOREVER to come out. In fact, an 8 top that sat at the same time received their food, ate it, paid & the table was being resat by the time our (incorrect) food arrived. Half the annoyance was the lack of communication, a manager should have been made aware of the delay & made a table visit. Though our food was delivered incorrect it was quickly corrected.The fried rice (with chicken) was decent, the Volcano Roll had a thick blob of crab paste over top rather than the light mayo based crab salad I was anticipating.Over all it was a disappointment, I will not return to Bento."
8/16/2017,5,"I've tried a ton of items on the menu at Bento in the past,  but this 5 star review goes out to my one true love, the Japanese Curry. Ever since I first tried it on that glorious day, I can't bring myself to order anything else on the menu anymore. No, seriously, it's THAT good.My favorite way to order it is with a curry katsu rice bowl. The curry is not spicy at all, but rather has a rich and savory flavor. I actually did some research, as Japanese curry is somewhat new to me, and I learned that it's a ginger base curry (sometimes called golden curry) which makes A TON of sense considering my obsession with all foods ginger.But enough about their Japanese curry.. everything else really is excellent as well and the service is always top notch. This downtown location gets slammed on the weekends, so it can feel a bit cramped in the small space, but it's never been a major issue for me."
5/30/2016,4,"Love Bento. Great food, from sushi rolls and noodle bowls. Something for everyone to enjoy. I love the Special Mexican Roll the most, as well as the krab wontons! always a great staff, who are friendly and helpful."
7/4/2015,4,"I was really impressed with this place! I got a tuna roll made with no rice  (I was feeling very healthy) and it was delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. The tuna was very fresh and enjoyable. The veggies were also very fresh and firm. I also got a ginger salad, but I wasn't that impressed. The dressing was just okay and I probably wouldn't get it again. My husband got the orange chicken bento box and it was a ton of food! He really liked it and didn't finish everything. The restaurant itself was very clean and nicely styled. It had tall ceilings and a modern vibe that worked well. Our server was pleasant and brought everything fairly promptly. The check took a bit longer than it should have, but we were part of a group so it wasn't unexpected.Overall, I really enjoyed this place. It was fresh, really conveniently located, and reasonably priced."
2/24/2019,1,The freshness of the sushi is lacking. Ok prices Not great sushi. Move on unless you want mediocre.
11/25/2015,5,So! Much! Food! Quality bento boxes and at a more than fair price . The seasonal pumpkin wontons were amazing :)
8/16/2015,2,"Decided to grab a bite here with my husband tonight before our movie upstairs, but I quickly regretted it. We didn't have a ton of time before the movie start time, but we were really hungry, so we figured we'd just go downstairs and maybe just be a little late to our movie. The movie was to start at 7:45pm, but everyone knows they always show a bunch of commercials and trailers, first. No big deal if we're 10, even 15 minutes late, especially since we already had our tickets in hand. We got there around 7:30pm. Ordered our food around 7:40pm, since my husband was feeling indecisive and we took advantage of the free appetizer with Yelp check in! Our appetizer of choice was fried pork dumplings and arrived at our table almost instantly. I was like, ""Cool, see, this was a good idea!"" - but I was wrong. We ordered our entrees at the same time we ordered our appetizer to try to expedite the whole process, and even though we ordered everything at approximately 7:40pm & got our appetizer super quick, we didn't receive our entrees until around 8:10pm! Yes, approximately half an hour later on a Sunday evening when they didn't even seem that busy and we had to watch everyone dining at the tables around us receive their food before us. No explanation was ever given, either. It was so frustrating, to say the least! We just ate as quickly as possible & left! I thought, good thing I was smart enough to ask for the check right after ordering, as well or else we would've been even later for our movie! I did later tell my husband, though, that I wish we hadn't paid right away, so we could just have left cash on the table for the app & left, instead of sitting across from each other, looking at each other with pure anxiety & frustration. Having a small child means we don't get many nights out just the two of us, so it's even more frustrating when our precious, rare alone time is wasted! This was our first time here and they definitely did not leave a good impression on us. I think we'd come back in the future (MAYBE) but ONLY if we had plenty of time to spare!"
9/3/2019,2,Bento's used to be my favorite place to go 4 Sushi and their Bento Box. However ever since they did away with table service the quality of food and service has become terrible. The sides in a Bento Box are nothing more than a forkful of lettuce and a fork full of noodles. And they have done away with they're sweet wonton dessert. The sushi and rolls remain fresh but have become smaller in size. It's very disappointing and I probably will not go there anymore
6/17/2017,4,"Returned and again did the Happy Hour buy two rolls and get another free... but ordered the  volcano roll (krab, cream cheese, avocado, topped with salmon, then baked with spicy mayo, topped with scallions) and also the Florida roll which includes tuna, salmon, cream cheese, avocado, topped with masago. That was perfect!"
11/22/2019,5,"This restaurant is very good for the price! For about $10-$15 you get a big bowl full of food, and a drink! Plus, you can even get a drink and side for a few dollars extra. The service was very quick as well. This is a great option if you like Asian food, and you're in a bit of a rush!"
11/2/2017,2,"A few of my contacts raved about this place, but I wasn't too impressed. It's your typical overdressed, forgettable, generic Asian-fusion chain restaurant.The place seems to get a little crazy on busy nights, with everyone running around like the kitchen is secretly on fire. The service was hot-and-cold; the servers either outright ignore you or homestead at your table. I tried a sushi combo one night, and a noodle bowl a couple days later. The food was just alright, nothing spectacular or offensive either way; maybe a little higher on price and presentation than it deserves. But I suspect most people don't go here to get fed, they go here because it's convenient to downtown and the theater. Like, if I had a choice I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but I wouldn't actively avoid it either. It's just...there. Location, location, location, as they say."
6/14/2018,4,I like bento. I think the quality has gone down over the years. I went in yesterday and wanted to get some sushi. It was okay but confusing. Do we order when we walk up or do we sit down? Always confusing. The food is good but the noodles are undercooked. The servers were nice but wouldn't really ask if we needed anything... especially since we ordered at the bar. Very confusing. Over all it is a place to come in and out. I would take the noodles home and cook them if you don't like it undercooked.
12/29/2015,5,"I'm proud to say that my first meal here in Florida was at this place and I wasn't disappointed. Although the exterior is dark, there's plenty of parking and the inside of the restaurant is lit beautifully. There's also outdoor seating if you don't want to wait for a table. For a table of 5 on a busy Sunday night, it was at least a 30 min wait so we opted to grab to go and a table outside. Food came out fast and the workers are very friendly. The beef fried rice was decent and flavorful. My father had the bulgolgi and he said it was awesome. Sushi was on point here! I would definitely recommend grabbing to-go here because it gets pretty busy."
8/5/2016,5,I frequent this place with co-workers at least three times a month. Matter of fact one one of them would come to work on a Sunday just for Bento's. The service is always great for takeout and dine in.I recommend the Spicy Cream Chicken. I typically get the noodle bowl but both the rice bowl and bento box are great choices depending on your taste and hunger level. I also love the spring rolls but truth be told I haven't had anything from here that I didn't like.
11/16/2019,5,"Always good.  It was raining slightly and we were walking back from a walk at Lake Eola.  My daughter wanted fried rice, it was a not a hard decision, take a short walk to Bento.  We got there and the line was long with a packed restaurant.  Their team was very efficient and friendly.  We ordered and sat within 10 minutes.  The steak wok fried rice and my Szechuan steak rice bowl came out quick and hot.  She devoured her bowl which meant it was really good.  My rice bowl was equally as good and the veggies we cooked just enough with still a crisp to them."
12/17/2017,2,"The bento boxes are decent.  Sushi is mediocre at best.   I usually go for lunch for the convenience factor, but tonight I went for dinner with friends, and now I don't think I'll go back.  The service was terrible.  It's always busy there, and tonight didn't seem out of the ordinary, but there was an insane delay between when we ordered and ultimately got our food.  Nearly 45 minutes for my sushi roll? And to make it worse, the server was kind of unapologetic about it.  It may not have been his fault, but he didn't even make an effort to check in, get drinks, etc.  I even heard him snap back at some other customers who were growing impatient.  Not impressed."
9/28/2015,5,"Very happy with this place! Order at the front then sit yourself down. So it's like a mix of a fast food place and restaurant. I got the orange chicken bento box and it was so much stuff! All on a sectioned off tray, it was the perfect amount of food! I finished everything and it was all perfect. Not so much to comment on the service end since it's basically self serve other than they bring the plate to your table, I don't mind that at all, just average people working there. Neither rude nor super friendly. Perfect for a lunch break from work or a get together with friends, it's right under the downtown movie theater. I would totally come here for good eats then head upstairs for a movie!"
8/23/2015,5,"Happy to have found a Bento Cafe so close to our place in Orlando!  I usually went to the locations in Gainesville and that's where I learned about Bento's, so after moving down to Orlando I was hoping they'd have locations here and they do! (Quite a few, too ^^)I got an order of steamed Edamame courtesy of Yelp, and they were delicious! They were lightly sweet and salty - a perfect beer snack in my opinion. For my entree I ordered the Chirashi bowl with chef's choice of sashimi and it was heavenly! The sushi rice was light and not overly sweet, the strips of sashimi I got tasted really fresh and had a lot of fatty content in them (yum!), and it had a nice garnish of cucumbers and seaweed salad. Everything tasted light and well-prepared.I will be coming back! Thanks!!"
9/18/2016,5,"Exceptional quality with a unique twist. The noodle bowls are delicious and filling, and the sushi is flavorful and bold.It's a favorite lunch destination during the week owing to the simple ordering process and quick service.  I'm a huge fan of the bento boxes, either with the noodle or the rice. The Mongolian beef is to die for. The service has been hit or miss on the weekends, when it switches from order and pay to full service dining. The decor, however, has never been a disappointment, with the relaxing and inviting aura, coupled with the spacious and open seating area.The open kitchen concept is a nice touch, and the sushi chefs are either flown in from Japan or Japanese descendants, which adds to the quality of the sushi and the technique they employ. For quicker service they do provide takeout for those busy bees that need to eat or he run or at their office desk.My recommendation would be the order a miso soup, a small roll, likely the Florida roll, and finish off with a bentonite box. You'll leave satiated and ready to take a desk nap."
11/17/2015,4,"I probably eat here on average twice a week. The food at the price can't be beat. Good quality and quick. I like to try a different dish overtime I go in and I can't really say I've ever found a dish I haven't finished. For newbies I recommend the spicy cream chicken or any one of their amazing sushi rolls, but my new favorite item on the menu is the Curry Katsu. It's just spicy enough for me and I mean who doesn't love fried breaded chicken? At $10-$11 the bento box really can't be beat. It fills you up and gives you a number of options and flavors for you to munch down on."
5/23/2017,4,Bento is one of my go-to places for lunch in Downtown Orlando during the week! It can get a bit busy in there but I am always able to find a seat and get my food quickly. They usually have two people working the registers during busier times to get through the lunch rush line. I always order a Bento Box but usually change up what I get in it. I feel as though I get a lot of food for the price I pay - usually around $10. I am never disappointed in the food that arrives at the table (usually in a timely manner). Their sushi is also quite delicious. All of their food tastes fresh and flavorful.
11/6/2018,3,"Sometimes good. Sometimes bad. Good for quick bite. Orange tofu noodle bowl is better than shrimp. My friend had the tuna poke bowl which was ""underwhelming"". Last time staff did Not know what many items on the menu were! and food was sloppy and rushed. However, the first time we amazing service, BOGO wine, and tasted special."
10/17/2015,5,This has been one of my go to spots for a while! The location is perfect to stop before or after a movie in the plaza and even before a night downtown. The prices are reasonable and the bento box is the best deal! I can't help but always get the spicy cream chicken with salad noodles and a dessert. The cream sauce is a perfect balance of sweet spice! I wish I could bottle it! I've also tried the sushi and gone for their wine special night. Always great service and delicious food!
2/12/2018,5,"Went to Bento with a old co- worker to catch up. We ordered special Mexican, Hot lava, and the TNT sushi. It was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this location over the sand lake because it seems to cater  more to the locals."
6/18/2019,5,"Everything from here was delicious especially the bowl where you add your own ingredients, the best tofu ever!"
11/20/2019,4,"I eat here for lunch 1-2/mo, I work downtown.  I get the same thing every time because I like it. (Bento box - mostly because of the box so mu food doesn't touch) I love the green beans and the edamame.  Today, I ordered the same thing as always and the cashier rang it up, whatever.   They brought me broccoli, no beans.  Where are my beans, I asked? The young man was very polite.  He apologized once,  explained (farmers-whatever) offered me anything to substitute.  I only like what I like and I told him that there was nothing else I wanted or that he could do,  just bring entree and rice (yuck) so he brings WAY too much rice in a HUGE bowl with the ckn on top of it.  My friend smiled and looked down because she knew I couldn't/wouldn't eat it.  I smiled and explained that it was touching so he immediately swept it away and brought me 2 separate bowls 1with rice 1 with ckn.  Both times with a smile.  When it was finally as good as it was going to get,  I explained to him that I was not trying to be a dick and that I appreciated his respectful attitude and professional handling since I recognized the situation was beyond his control.  Lesson:  sometimes crappy things happen but it's how you handle it that makes you rise above the common.  Great job handling this unfortunate situation.  Lunch was so-so today but I got great service and felt good about the encounter."
6/9/2015,1,If they had a negative star to choose from I would select that!! You come downtown all amped with high expectation and end up with plastic wear. Even plastic cups and plates. And this after being told I could not have a more comfortable table because they had cleaned it for the night and the server for that section had left for the night..... REALLY?! Shrimp Tempura was under cooked while the Krab in the spider roll was way over cook. Very greasy. My friend and I took one bight and was ready to leave. We tried to stick it out even though we did not like the feel nore the service.... We wanted to give this place a chance. Now we can't figure out how they stay a float.??!!
2/11/2017,5,Five stars for the Spciy Don with half tuna half salmon! Always taste fresh and love the cucumber salad with avocado on it! The rice alone is perfection... I swear they put crack on their rice! Pure sticky perfection!! I can't speak for the sushi here but I can't stop coming back for the spicy don bowl! Healthy(ish) and delicious!
4/1/2017,4,"While staying at a near by resort, my friends and I were craving sushi and when we went on Yelp, this was the closest location that was still open at 9pm on a Saturday Night.  After we had ordered  4 rolls, crab Rangoon, and tonkatsu with red curry.  Everything came out to be under $20 and we were super stuffed.  I was hoping we would have restaurants like this in NOVA, but sadly, this chain is only located in Florida. I will definitely be coming back for more!"
2/15/2011,4,"Yum. Not sure why it took me so long to try this place out. Great location, in the Downtown Plaza. The ambiance is pretty cool, very open and low lit along with some cool textures among the light fixtures.  It was poppin' on a Saturday evening but we were seated very quickly and it looks like the turnover was pretty quick for a small, busy place. We sat next to the window so we did have to deal with the people walking by looking in the window. It wasn't bad though and any seat on the perimeter will be this way as it's all windows. Cheese wontons? YES PLEASE! They are like Crab rangoon but with more amazing cheesy goodness than usual. They came out hot and fresh along with some great edemame that was cooked perfectly. It took a while to get my glass of wine but the Riesling was refreshing. I went with the Gucci roll and let me tell you, delicious. It was like a low key volcano roll with crab and steamed shrimp. The topping was a tad spicy for me but delicious. It had ten pieces so with the two apps it was perfect.I dig this place and can't wait to go back and try lunch!"
5/30/2017,3,"First try of bento's today and it was decent. For starters the customer service sucked we went on a Sunday around 4:00 and the place was not busy we walked in took a few minutes for anyone to greet us even though 3 men were working right at the Sushi bar. Finally an employee helped and told us to order up front and we could sit anywhere. I ordered the orange chicken bento box, my husband had the sweet and sour shrimp. My bento box was ok but the chicken had a off taste not sure why (maybe not completely fresh). The noodles were cold and there was no one available to let you know it was cold once they brought you your box they disappeared into the back. Sting beans luke warm, I enjoy the ginger salad and the rice the most. My husband did not like his shrimp but ate everything else. I may try again maybe after 5 that's when they stated they do table service."
9/27/2017,4,Bento's food is delicious which is why I return so often but sometimes I feel like their staff makes a better effort on presentation some days more than others. Today's meal tasted great but it looked like it was sloppily put together.
3/8/2019,4,Great sushi. Quick bento box. Good portion sizes. Friendly service. Got free appetizer thru yelp....crab wontons!
5/4/2017,2,"Every time I come here I love it. Calling ahead for takeaway is SO EASY! I've never had to wait more than 5-10mins, until today. I'm late to work & the validation left me paying $5 for something that should've been free since I waited so long on my order that was sitting on the shelf! Mind you I called approx 10 mins prior to my arrival. 30 mins later I was out the door. I was the only person waiting for their food! I could understand getting overlooked if it was busy in the front... All that was needed was for someone to check back in earlier than 20 mins. I won't be back here for a while- it left me with a bad taste in my mouth for lunch before work."
5/22/2017,4,"This was my First time at the downtown location. I got there right as they opened and was the first person there. The employees were super nice and helpful with my questions as I noticed that the menu is a bit different and smaller than the UCF location. I usually get the create a don but I opted for the poke bowl and half a roll of a jean role which Were very good. The bowl was more than enough as I felt like I could have been rolled out of there but hey no regrets. You only live once right? The poke bowl was fresh, had some tuna in a soy sauce, avocado, a nice portion of Wakame, onions a couple mango pieces, some edamame beans and lots of rice. It was very pretty to look at and the price was just in line with the portion. I was a bit disappointed by the smaller menu since I'm used to the UCF one but on a positive note less options? Also I think I got 3 or 4 tiny piece of mango, so I felt like I was yipped on that and It really gives the bowl that sweet and salty balance."
9/24/2019,4,"This was a great place to grab a quick bite. They have a great build your own mentality with bento, curry, udon, and pretty much any other of your favorite Asian dishes. Food came very quickly which was great when I was so hungry."
8/27/2018,4,Good place for lunch time. It was super crowded around noon. The food took awhile to show up so that's why 4 stars. Food was great and plenty to eat. Looking at how they make sushi rolls are entertaining as well. Come stop by for a lunch?!
7/1/2015,5,"Best sushi restaurant. The quality of the rolls is always amazing. The flavors really pop, fish tastes fresh and I always leave full. I got the Crunch roll, Special Mexican roll, TNT roll and the Volcano rollCrunch roll comes slightly warm because the outside is flash fried to get the texture. Inside it's creamy from the cream cheese and tuna. It's a sweet roll from the eel sauceTNT is predominately tuna. special Mexican gets all different flavors. Goes down smoothly with a mix of spice and sweet. volcano has the salmon flavor. All delicious. Free appetizer with checkin."
5/9/2017,4,Came In Here after the movie. Needed food after popcorn....ya know.  I ordered rainbow roll and boy Bulgogi. Then I checked in after I sat down and noticed they had a free appitizer when spending $10 or more. So I went back up to counter and they gave me another number for my salad with miso dressing. Soooo all in all it was great. The items were both pretty good! Boy I'm full now tho!!
4/30/2013,4,"My second time going to a Bento Café in Orlando. My first experience was horrible. But this time around... it was the total opposite!The restaurant itself is very open and it had neat décor hanging from the ceiling. Our server was a younger guy- who was absolutely amazing. He seemed like he enjoyed his job, and was very attentive to us at the table. He was always sincerely smiling also!I had the soy chili beef bento box, which was great! Perfect amount of spiciness and perfect amount of food.... Overall delicious and fillingGreat experience at Bento's. Will go again!"
10/4/2019,4,It's a nice place to eat especially if you were thinking of going out after. The best Chicken tempura I've had so far. Try it.
12/15/2018,4,"This Bento box is amazing. The colors are vibrant, and the food tastes great. The amazing thing about this place is that they serve your food quickly."
8/5/2017,5,"Love this place. Great location downtown at the Cobb theatres on Orange Ave. Great selection of Bento Box, Noodle bowls, Rice bowls, Sushi, and many other options. Decent prices and all around good place."
11/7/2016,5,This is the place where I learned to love sushi!  I was never much of a seafood eater and the thought of seaweed and raw fish really grossed me out. Bento changed all of that! Their Lust roll has fried tilapia on top so it has a bit of crunch and a LOT of flavor so it wasn't an intimidating sushi taste. After that I have tried at least 20 of their other rolls and have never been disappointed. They also have rice and noodle bowls with chicken and other meat that are delicious as well. We have birthday parties and get togethers with friends here quite often so even if you aren't a sushi lover (I recommend at least trying the Lust roll) you can still enjoy an awesome meal! The location is awesome as well in the heart of downtown right under the movie theater at the Plaza. The parking garage is a little tight but they will validate for a certain time slot for you to park during dinner. And the theater validates as well if you decide to do dinner and a movie. I recommend Bento for lunch or dinner!
3/30/2019,5,"Always greeted with a smile, I've been here numerous times and the staff is always upbeat and seems happy to serve you! I usually order the Kawaii roll or chicken curry katsu bento box, superb every time! Food is always quick to!"
8/10/2018,1,Thanks bentos for taking it upon yourself to cancel my Uber Eats order and not having the courtesy to call or notify me or anyone at Uber eats. Mediocre customer service.
9/7/2017,5,"Suzuki was great. We came for their happy hour, which it awesome. We did the 2 for one Sakai and also two rolls getting a classic free. Had the Kawaii rolls and I absolutely loved it. The other rolls were great also. I've never been let down here!"
9/6/2017,3,Average.I ordered the red curry for lunch carryout. The sauce had very little flavor and was quite thick.  There was barely enough sauce to cover the vegetables.  Also it was all smashed into a small to-go container and it just did not look appetizing.I ordered in the restaurant around 1pm on a Wednesday and waited and waited and waited. I was about to ask why it was taking so long when it was brought out.I will not be returning.
12/2/2018,1,Waited around ten minutes for service no one came went to the front to ask for my waitress. I ask for napkins they told me to do to the back that I'll find everything I need.... Where's the service if u can provide de básicamente service
7/5/2018,5,"I like the fact that at this location you are able to go up to the register, order and then pick a seat.  I like this concept because it tends to move pretty fast.  There are plenty of seats available!  Super clean place, you are able to grab as many chopsticks, napkins or utensils right at the fountain drink station; which I love b/c you don't have to keep asking the server for this.  My food has always come out as great as the other Bento location.  You can also place order ahead and pick up, I have never had an issue here, staff is always friendly."
10/26/2017,5,This place is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite. The price is average. The foods are great. I love Dragon roll. I will definitely recommend this restaurant
12/5/2018,3,"So the local bento is a solid option if you're looking for something quick, hot, and flavorful. It's convenient and tasty and at least today was pretty quick. The two things I don't like so much are, you're pretty limited as far as your stir fry/bowl options. If you're like me and trying not to eat rice or noodles, there's no veggie base option. You just basically have to pay an up charge and create it yourself. This kinda irks me because I'm getting extra vegetables but I'm saving you the base you would have given me so in my mind, it should be a fair trade ‍ either way, I'm hoping they expand their base options in the future for those that don't want to get a rice bowl only to throw away all the rice. Second thing, I ordered the Sriracha garlic with Shrimp. Super tasty, definitely no complaints there, and served steaming hot. But as you can see in the pics, it's like.... 70% breading and 30% shrimp. It was described as Wok fried which in my mind sounded like something lightly fried so I was a bit disappointed when it came out as more breading than actual shrimp."
6/23/2020,5,"When I'm craving Asian food, my go to is Bento. For sushi I've had the cali and special mex roll. The Special Mex is so delicious. If you like sushi and shrimp, it a must try. On Tuesday's the chicken teriyaki bowl is $6 and it's good. The wok bowl is really good, as well as the lomein. Their sauces are a must, try them all! The only items I've tried that I wasn't a fan of was the ginger salad and cold noodles."
6/14/2014,5,Yummy sushi! On Saturday they do all you can eat sushi from 12-5. Good deal. You get a fountain drink and soup or salad. They have rules about how many rolls you can order at a time and you can't order again until you finish your rolls. they wanted to prevent excess leftovers and the waitresses were very sweet and attentive when they saw we were almost finished and ready to order the next round.The location is right by the movie theater which makes it a great place to grab a meal before or after catching a flick. I first had bento in Gainesville and continued to go to the one in Orlando. They customize their sushi to your liking and have quick service. Definitely coming back!
6/20/2019,5,Amazing food and great service i will be returning soon everything was hot and freash all my questions were answered not a long wait over all super happy with my experience
11/17/2017,4,I visited during lunch time around 12:30pm and it was a bit packed. Although i had to wait for only 10 minutes to place my order. I decided to get the Bento Chicken Rice bowl and my god the food was good and quantity was huge. I also got chicken dumplings which were tasty. The ambiance was great and am glad my colleague introduced this place to me :)
6/14/2016,5,"This is my absolutely favorite sushi place in downtown. I always order a new sushi roll and they've always been on point  I love their happy hour, buy two sushi rolls and get the third for free. It can add up, but it is sushi and it's really good!! I like the atmosphere too, very clean, organized, friendly service. It's literally in the middle of downtown, underneath the movie theaters. I definitely recommend this place :)"
11/3/2017,5,I love this place i come all the way from kissimmee to eat here. Always on point fast and the manager is very nice and fast.
8/25/2016,3,"**Attention** ManagersI have been at Bento's ones but it is was fast only was there with a friend and we where in out lunch and I had a great time here. I love their food it was delicious. So I had to go again but with more time and have a nice dinner with my husband.So I did around 3 weeks after this day.But I regret it omg it was the worst experience ever on my life.The first time I dined here I was with my friend and she helped me order since I don't speak English well. Right now I'm using a translator to right this review and I believe it would have many mistakes but oh well I'm doing the best I can. So when I ask the waitress if she speaks Spanish she told me ( I'm sorry I don't) and told me that their manager dose speak Spanish and that she would go and have her help us. This waitress it was really nice bout it. So I was facing the way she walked away and I saw when she when and talk to her manager and all I see is this ""manager"" if you call a person like that a manager, making horrible faces and attitude to the waitress and and ugly faces like she got really mad and you could tell that she was telling the waitress not to do this that she was to busy. So the waitress came back and say, my manager is doing something right now but if you don't mind I can try to help you and we can try to make this work. I told her that I know a little English but that we are not good at all since we only been living here for 1 year and that I would need help to understand the menu and ask about the condiments on the food so that I prefer to wait till the manager could had the time to wait. So she says ok no problem can I get you guys something to drink and we did got out drinks. Wait 10 minutes and still waiting there and all she was doing it was on her tablet. Keep waiting 15 more minutes and the waitress talk to her I think about us because she look back at us and after that she started to do the same thing, she rolled her eyes and breadth deeply and start waking to our table with a nasty face. I was so afraid omg that I was nervous while she was walking to our table I was thinking omg she is going to say something bad to us. So she games and say on Spanish ( can I have your order?) and I said I'm sorry we are not ready to order because I don't really understand the menu and that was my first time there and explain that I have been there only one time with a friend and that she helped me out so that I was lost any ways. She said everything is on the menu is not complicated you just need to read it. I would be back whenever you guys are ready and I stop her and say excuse me all I want to know is how some plates are made or what condiments it has. She told me I'm sorry but I can't sit here all day explaining the menu i have things to do plus I don't really speak Spanish. So then I ask ok so eat would you think we can eat that is going to be simple so we don't waste your time and she said to have this rice bowl that I don't even remember the name I'm sorry about that. So yes and then while my husband is telling her to bring him the same she took out order and tell us: you know we are in USA and you would need to learn English there is not going to be a Spanish translator to serve your everywhere. And I just open my eyes so big I was just impressed.She said that we Hispanic ppl need to learn that And I told her to excuse me but I know i need to learn English but I also know that we are in Orlando and that we have a lots of tourist here that just come to visit and that they don't need to learn just to be here 4 to 7 days so that I knew this is USA but I also know that here is lots of tourist so that me don't knowing English it was not a big deal. And she says oh yes it is really important because right now I'm taking out of my busy time to help you guys when y'all should know English already.And I was just in shock omg She left And never came back she was just there at the bar with her tablet. So the waitress girl  brought us out food we eat and when we where done and the waitress came to pick up out plates I ask her what was that ""managers"" name And she told me that her name was ANDRE And I think that the waitress told her that I ask about her name because she look back at us and roll her eyes and I was seen how she was moving her hands with a attitude I feel bad for that waitress maybe she got in trouble for saying her name to us. But any ways Ppl especially Latinos Don't come and eat at this place unless you speak English And Attention to the superior management ppl Please make sure you don't have hypocrites ppl working in places with customers if they don't like pplAnd I say hypocrite because I'm pretty sure that she is the type of persons that act proper and lovely in front of other bigger managers or owner. But I got so upset and I felt so discriminate that all I felt that day was sadness."
9/25/2016,3,"Thoroughly enjoyed our bento boxes.  This is somewhere between fast food and an slick urban restaraunt.  The food is like really good, really healthy fast food.  The green beans are a lovely touch.  I like this place.  Noisy?  yes--but with good energy.  I got the curry which was good.  Rob got bulgogi beef which was also good.  You know, for fastish food."
3/10/2015,3,"I had heard a lot about Bento with mixed reviews. I had came here for lunch with my boyfriend and we both agreed that the bento box (chicken teriyaki) reminded us of the mall food court and not the good kind. We absolutely loved the sushi and was blown away by that. For lunch, you order at the front, pay, and get your own drink then sit down as oppose to dinner where it is full service."
6/22/2016,4,A reliable go-to for lunch in the city.  We love the salmon don bowl - it's like a deconstructed sushi roll in the form of a chipotle-like bowl. It's delicious!!!!
3/25/2016,4,"I stopped by Bento Cafe when I was in Orlando and had a hankering for sushi. It was really good value, and Gabriel was a super friendly server. Only reason they don't get 5* was just that it was in a mini mall and just didn't have a very great ambiance to it. That said, we did sit next to a group of girls who were HIGHLY entertaining, So I guess, it's great for people watching. :)"
5/4/2019,5,Great place for sushi. The food is delicious. The service is very fast. The prices are great. We come here every other Friday for a sushi lunch.
11/9/2016,3,Wanted to grab something to eat before going to the movies. So we decided this place would work. our waitress was so nice and patient with us since we didn't known what we wanted when looking at the menu. once we decided the food came out fast. I am a big fan of bulgogi because my bestie korean mom use to make it for me all the time so if I see it on the menu i order it. It was ok. good enough to keep me fed and ready for the movie.
5/28/2020,5,"Bento has easily become my favorite place to dine at in Central Florida. The food, the atmosphere, the staff, and the social media team are my complete favorite! Each time I go in, whether it is at their Dr. Phillips or Margaritaville locations, the food is top notch. I usually go for the Pao Pao Chicken Rice Bowl and a Taro Boba Tea. The chicken is cooked perfectly and goes well with their white sauce. In addition, the boba tea tastes like an oreo cookie! I definitely will continue to frequent Bento."
3/11/2019,5,"I have always hated egg/spring rolls BUT HOLY GOD this is the most delectable thing I may have ever had. I think about the often they are so perfectly cooked here. And of course the sauce they come with is soo tasty. Their rolls are very filling and fantastic. I am obsessed with sushi and I highly recommend Bento. Also their tofu vegetable medley bowl is. Take out is fantastic too! We order for delivery (Uber eats, doordash, etc.) on fight nights and the food is always hot and perfectly cooked. I really highly recommend."
12/29/2016,3,"Stopped here after an event last night. It was packed, and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, the service was equally bad.You order from a counter, but for how swamped they were, they had one girl working the counter and she was over-whelmed. After a solid wait, we placed our order. Immediately after swiping our card, she simply left. No idea where she went, but we grabbed our receipt and went to a table.Not long after, a server brought out a bag. All of our food had been packed to go. Wtf? So we tell him the order was for here, not to-go, and he simply shugs and says, ""the order said to-go."" Okay... so please fix it?He notes we're welcome to open the bags and eat here, but never offers to y'know, take the food and fix it. Additionally, one item was missing.So we unpacked everything and ate. Once we got all our items, the food was delicious. I had the Katsu Curry, and we also had a Vegetable Stir Fry and Garlic Soy bento box. All delicious.Unfortunately, the server gave an incredible, ""it's the end of the night, we screwed up, eh, who cares"" vibe. Which sadly soured most of the experience.Ignoring the servers seemingly half out the door attitude, the food was excellent. Not sure we'd be back."
8/24/2016,4,We stopped here for a late night dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark with a lot of tables cramped together however we opted for the small sushi bar and were happy there. We had the sashimi special which was a plentiful array of sushi and sashimi completed with a spicy tuna roll...everything was very fresh. They have unique healthy sushi rolls which are wrapped with lettuce and rice paper...highly recommend the Surf 'n' Kawaii. We shared a bowl of shrimp tempura udon...the noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was rich...it reminded us of Marukame Udon.Overall we really enjoyed it and will likely be back
12/29/2018,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE, food is amazing & price is even better!! the location is great & the inside is too good."
1/21/2016,5,"I frequent this sushi location downtown. It can be a little slow at lunch time, so either order takeout ahead of time or be prepared to be there about 45min-1 hour. They have a nice wine selection and a great sushi selection.The Special Mexican Roll and the Crunch Roll are some of my favorites! I always get the edamame too."
3/7/2019,3,"The spicy chicken udon noodle bowl is my FAVORITE hands down from this place, but other than that  I feel like there are better places for quality sushi. I've had their soup and I feel it is over priced for the lack of consistency in the soup. The poke bowls were good but every add on is an upcharge and it can get pricey."
8/12/2019,3,"Sher didn't warn me that their ginger salad dressing was equally as effective as pepper spray as it is delicious. Other than that, good food, great service. As long as you don't accidentally flick the salad dressing into your eye, the place is great. Will upgrade to 5 stars once Sher agreed to grab drinks with me."
1/26/2017,5,Tonight is hockey with the Orlando Solar Bears at the Amway Center. But I am actually looking forward to my Spicy Tuna Don Bowl from the Bento kiosk at Amway. The food at this location is always so fresh and amazingly delicious. And the sauces they use are the best I have ever had. The staff that runs this location are truly dedicated to their culinary craft. I feel like a valued guest when I order my masterpieces from Bento. I can't wait until the doors open tonight!
2/2/2014,4,"I must pick up dinner from Bento once a week! It is a great downtown spot for typical Asian-fusion with decent prices and portions.  They offer a wide variety of Japanese and Thai style dishes that can be served as a bento box, noodle or rice bowl.  I love their pad thai (either chicken or shrimp) and their Thai fried rice has a nice kick to it.  The red curry dish is okay, the spice is very over powering and there is not much curry flavor to it.  I enjoy both their dumplings and shumai from the appetizer list.  They also have an extensive sushi menu, my favorite roll is the TNT roll which always has fresh tuna and a great kick!! I have always taken my food to go so I can't comment on the sit down service but they always have my food ready in 10-15 min from when I call it in and the staff at the counter is very friendly.  The decor inside is very modern with darker lighting and seems like it would be a nice date spot, especially before visiting the theatre upstairs. Be on the lookout for their new location in the UCF area on the corner of university and alafaya!!*tip: be sure and check their fb page as they have a number of specials including all you can eat sushi and half of bottles of wine and sake depending on the day!"
2/24/2016,3,"Food was decent but a little overpriced for the selection. Their sushi lunch combo is basically 1 roll plus 4 piece Californian for $10. No soup or salad, so not a great combo if you ask me. Great location if you work downtown and can walk but kind of a pain to park unless you are coming down here for an evening of fun. Service isn't too bad at lunch. Seating is cramped though."
12/8/2018,4,Winter Park location is not currently accepting coupons or check in discounts or offers.
8/1/2018,5,Wow! Super cheap for really good food! The menu is daunting and a little off to order from at first but the staff will help you out. Sushi is terrific. All the proteins are delicious. Don't skip the fried rice. Do a Tuesday movie upstairs ($5 all day) and definitely do this after.
2/17/2016,4,"I met up with some friends here yesterday and I wanted to try the new spicy miso ramen. It seemed a little pricey compared to another local ramen shop I've been to, and there weren't too many options with it (but then again, I didn't ask). The presentation was nice, even though I had asked for the pork on the side. The taste was okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either. Not really spicy. I would have liked more pork, or other veggies in the soup. Usually I come for their rice or noodles dishes. We dined in and it was a bit of a mess inside. A lot of tables were not bussed/not set. There were huge puddles of water near the soda machine and they had no water since there was a problem with their dispenser that was leaking. They gave us the option to choose from any of the other drinks, but my friends were a little irked. One of the servers boxed up my meal for me, and separated the broth from the noodles which was a plus! Tasted great the next day."
3/18/2018,3,This place really deserves a 3.5. The sushi is pretty good but the selection isn't. I had a hard time picking a few rolls that looked good during happy hour. I thought they had way too much imitation crab on the menu. I enjoyed the Mexican roll at least.
6/11/2016,4,"Our 1st time here.We've been to their UCF location many times and have always enjoyed it. This one caters more to the sushi eating crowd downtown.  Friendly help, good food, as always!"
9/13/2018,5,Love this place most affordable sushi with great quality. The bento box is very filling.
12/8/2015,2,"I didn't have the greatest experience at Bento Cafe.  Our server was very nice about the whole thing, but my food took over an hour to arrive, 20 minutes after everyone else at the table.  I ordered a seaweed salad that I never received, and while it wasn't included on my bill I wasn't given anything but an apology for the wait.Other than that, the sushi I ordered was not any of their fancy rolls, just a California Roll and some nigiri.  The tuna wasn't very flavorful, and the sushi wasn't anything extraordinary.  Overall not someplace I'd be dying to try again."
11/8/2018,5,"They were super slammed when we came for lunch today. The line took a while to get through but our food came out super fast and everything was fresh and delicious! The staff is constantly moving, making sure the tables are clean and that you have everything you need. Highly recommend!"
6/27/2016,5,I am very picky when it comes to my sushi. This is definitely one of my favorite places. Service is amazing! I order a sushi roll that was different from my usual roll. I only had one piece and realized I made a mistake. I told the waitress that I wasn't to find of it and she recommended a different roll in place of that one at no additional charge! That was super nice of her. Food was delicious. My friend ordered a soup and I had rolls. A very nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to others.
1/6/2014,4,I have only ordered noodle bowls here but I like them a lot. My favorite so far has been the Basil Beef noodle bowl. I have only ordered take out so I can't comment on the service. I wish I didn't have to wait so much in line to pick up and pay for my order but I guess they are just really busy and they get a lot of walk ins.
10/20/2018,4,Excellent mix of Asian styles. Had the crab cheese wontons (don't forget to check in on yelp so they are free) and Mongolian chicken bowl. There lowmain was cooked through and took the seasoning well and the bowl had a great mix of vegetables. The staff was supper friendly though initially they told us there was a 15 min wait they found us a table a few minutes later. Overall a great place to grab Asian fusion in downtown.
9/28/2015,3,"I've been to this location several times and each time I'm let down. The food itself is good. It's pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary. My issue is the staff here. I come during my lunch hour, and I get that it's busy. What I don't get is the attitude from the staff. I'm always very friendly because I understand how busy they get. The last thing they want is a troublesome customer so getting attitude when you're trying to be nice bothers me. I've always been greeted by unfriendly staff and I feel intimidated to ask questions..... The foods good but I won't go because of the service."
9/30/2018,5,"This is the best sushi spot in downtown Orlando. It's very quaint location and the salmon specialty signature bowl is right down seductive! There is no other sushi spot that offers such. So, visit and tell them you will thank me later."
12/5/2018,2,"After waiting nearly 30 minutes to receive my to go order today, I requested a couple white sauces. I am aware one is complimentary but the cashier said, no problem. Just ask when they bring your food. The waitress that brought my order told me she can only give me one. I needed to get back to work and decided not to argue about it. She then stared at me while I tried my back at the cashier area to make sure I don't try and ask one of the others for an extra sauce. I've been eating at Bento for 8 years. May be eating there a little less now."
8/25/2018,5,Spicy cream chicken is bomb!  used to order from this restaurant about two days a week!Highly suggested
4/15/2018,2,"Food was really great but friends food had a price of paper cooked in it, and server kept forgetting to bring things. Like our hot tea which he brought when we were ready to pay check cuz he had just remembered we ordered it before ordering our food."
12/23/2015,4,"I've only been here twice, but both times I really enjoyed it.  If you're a Yelper, make sure you check in!  You get a free appetizer!  I got the garlic edamame the first time and wasn't completely in love with it, so I went for the regular edamame the second time and very much enjoyed it.  I had a bento box with tofu stir fry on my first visit.  It was good and exciting that they offered tofu since I am a vegetarian.  On my next visit, I decided to go with the veggie delite roll and preferred that.  Both times I enjoyed some white peach saki!  It's so smooth and flavorful, it could get you into some trouble if you're not careful!  The staff is also very helpful and friendly, which is always refreshing when going out to eat.  Can't wait to go back!"
4/2/2015,2,"I was less than impressed with Bento Orlando, to be honest. The original Bento (blue) in Gainesville for a long time was a favorite of mine, but honest evaluation of it was clouded by fond memories of first dates there and the like. Plus, I believe in general the quality at all the Bento outlets I've visited has gone down over time. Maybe they have good days, but I feel their food is simply not of the caliber it was at the original location circa 2004-2009. Bento's downtown Orlando location has a great spot in an area thick with nightlife and, by day, a lot of office-workers. Thus, their business is probably pretty good. Unlike the Gainesville locations, they have waiter service at night instead of ordering at the counter. To me, this wastes time, money (for the additional tip) and staff resources. All other Bentos have, as far as I am aware, a policy of ordering at the counter then a waiter brings out the food. My waitress was perfectly nice and pretty attentive, but the approach just seemed unnecessary. The food was . . . sub-standard. The green beans, noodles, and salad in my bento box were all stale-tasting and seemed to have been sitting around too long. Granted, I was there late at night, but for three items included in all bento box orders to be off like this seems pretty poor. The garlic-soy chicken--the main item of my bento--was only ok, contained little chicken, and tasted also like it might have either sat around or (more likely) been prepared of ingredients that had marinated too long. If this only happened once, and less than an hour before closing, that would be ok. But it's been a common issue I've found at several Bento locations. Their food quality just seems to be slipping in dire terms. The interior is dark, trendy, and eye-catching. This could be a great restaurant if a little more care was placed in the quality coming out of the kitchen. Look to Hawker's for an example of what can be done with mid-point priced Asian-fusion cuisine in Orlando. Bento, I fear, is resting on its laurels and taking advantage of a plum location currently, nothing more."
8/6/2018,3,Sushi was ok nothing special (not worth the $40 we spent).   Weren't many options to choose from in my opinion.
3/27/2018,5,"Very busy, decent friendly service, validated $2.50 in Plaza pkg garage.  Food was most excellent!"
5/20/2016,5,I'm here all the time for lunch and dinner and tonight was especially nice. brought the family and had a serious feast. the Happy Hour is beyond ridiculous. ridiculously good now. 4-7. BOGO APPS SAKE AND ROLLS!! our server was the best. just look for the bearded guy. cheers!
11/22/2019,1,I ate here last night and got a salmon/tuna poke bowl. Everything was fine till I started throwing up hours later and couldn't stop. This place was the only thing I ate and I got food poisoning. DO NOT GET ANYTHING RAW UNLESS YOU WANT TO THROW UP FOR 7 HOURS STRAIGHT AND SLEEP ON YOUR BATHROOM FLOOR.
5/5/2018,5,"Had the Charashi Bowl when I went, Filled me up. It was great I went at happy hour and had 2 for 1."
12/30/2015,4,"I LOVE Bento! If it weren't for the parking situation, id be there every day. Some of my favorite sushi rolls include the Japanese Bagel, Tampa and Chicken Tempura rolls. If you wanna try an entree, go for the Spicy Cream Chicken. It's literally to die for. The service at this location is always great, and they have happy hour throughout the week. It doesn't get busy very quickly so be sure to get there early!"
11/22/2017,5,So yummy. I always make a point to stop in when I'm downtown. I haven't had anything bad here yet and the service is quick.
2/24/2018,3,"The servers and employees tend to take a while to acknowledge you when you walk in, leaving you with that awkward feeling of ""should we stay at this point?"" but once you're seated it's fine. They also take awhile to 'get the check to you, ring you out' when dining in. The food is as good as other locations so that's good, we generally order to go if when we can, but definitely a good pre or post movie theater meal."
9/18/2016,5,"We tried for the first time the buffet $22.22 menu which runs from 12-3:30pm as a summer special. We arrived at the restaurant at 3:05. They extended our summer special and accommodated our needs. The service was spectacular. The sushi is delicious. The hot tea was not very good. It did not seem typical of an Asian tea. We did not attempt to try any of the desserts because the sushi was delicious and very fulfilling. The decor was average. The lighting was great for the ambiance. Not to bright but not too dim. Perfect for lunch time. The temperature in the restaurant was great, very important in the Florida heat. The waitress was very nice. Always attentive and refilling our drinks appropriately. It was a great time here at Bento."
2/2/2016,3,"Sushi was good, the menu had a lot of variety. Quick and Easy, but nothing spectacular.Satisfying though !"
1/29/2015,2,"So, a while back my wife and I came here to get dinner before going to a movie. We didn't have a great experience. Slow service. Mediocre sushi. Lack of attention from the wait staff. But, we like to give places second chances. Sometimes people just have a bad day.So, last week we came back, hoping to catch dinner before going to see a movie. We got in aruond 6pm on a Thursday. The sign said for us to seat ourselves, so we did. Not busy at all. A few tables, that's it. Our server came by immediately and was really nice. Great start! But that's where things started to go downhill.Before I get into the negative. Let me just say our sever, I forget her name, was really really sweet. She was reasonably attentive. No real qualms with her. The problems seem to be rooted in the kitchen. My wife ordered a veggie delight roll, explaining that she can't have any dairy as she's allergic (NOT lactose intollerant..allergic. as in, dairy can kill her). I ordered one of the fancier rolls. My wife asked for a miso soup to start. That came out fairly promptly. The server came back about 5 minutes after we ordered to let us know that it was happy hour and we could get a classic roll for free since we ordered two rolls. Sweet. I ordered a plain salmon roll. All goodHowever, as time went on, we waited and waited for our rolls. 15 minutes. 20 minutes. Now pushing 30 minutes. Other diners came in, ordered and hard already started eating their meals, including sushi. So, it's not like sushi was the hold up here.Right when I was about to complain, the server brought out our plain salmon roll...the free one. OK, well, that's fine. At least we can eat something. Another 10 minutes goes by. Now we are getting close on time since we have a movie to catch. People who came in after us are finishing up and we really haven't even started the rolls we really ordered. Again, right when I was about to complain, she comes with our rolls and apologizes for the wait. Big problem however: my wife's roll has a huge chunk of cream cheese in each piece. Remember the dairy allergy? So, now we have to wait another 5+ minutes for them to remake it. Took them no time really, but I have to wait while my roll (which had tempura on it) is getting cold. I'm so hungry it hurts, and I just have to stare at my food because I'm not eating while my pregnant wife just sits there.Eventually we got our food and scarfed it down. Not enjoyable. The food was ok. nothing remarkable or worth the wait. I'll be hard-pressed to go here again. I feel bad for the server, as I know it's not her fault but she'll probably get the brunt of the comlpaints for the kitchen's ineptitude."
2/19/2009,5,"At the Bento restaurant, you can either order at the counter or sit down for full service. We decide to sit down. The waitress is attentive and takes our order. We order the spicy creamy chicken noodle bowl ($6.95) and the Chirashi sushi bowl ($10.50) with a taro boba tea drink ($2.75).The main dishes arrive soon after. The Korean spicy chicken is creamy, warm, and tenderly fried to perfection. The noodles are moist and flavorful and arrive in a large bowl. The Chirashi bowl comes with sushi rice, fresh and tasty pieces of salmon, tuna, white tuna, shrimp, and a side of seaweed salad, ginger, and wasabi. I devour the pieces of sashimi, licking the last pieces of sushi rice from the bowl. It is like sushi rolls but without the roll and in a bowl.for more please visit my blog, tastychomps.blogspot.com…"
1/7/2018,4,"Good place to grab a quick bento at downtown area. My favorite is their spicy creamy chicken bowl. Also make good use of their happy hours mom-fri from 4-7 pm：buy 2 rolls get 3rd free, or free appetizer for an entree"
10/11/2018,5,"Amazing bowls! Love the food always, one of my favorite spots to go to, we go on the weekly!"
3/11/2017,5,"I love Asian food and this is one of the best. We went to the Dr Phillips location on a Friday evening and there was a long wait for a table so we took a seat outside. We then went to counter inside to order then they deliver the food to your table. There are so many choices to choose from, rice bowls, noodle bowls or bento boxes as well as sushi. I chose a bento box which comes with steamed rice, Lo Me in, ginger salad, string beans plus an entree, I had pork katsu. My husband had a rice bowl with spicy red curry and a beer. The food as usual was great and it was so nice sitting outside on a warm Florida night in December."
1/3/2013,4,"A great place for a quick, cheap meal.Food - I categorize Bento Cafe as high class fast food. Very similar to Panera. You order and pay then you sit and eat. I always get a the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box. It usually comes with a small dessert which I always substitute for either rice or noodles. After reading some of the other reviews, I think I may have to try the spicy tuna don bowl as it sounds delicious. I love sushi, but have never tried theirs. Atmosphere - Chic and trendy.You can order and pick it up.Definitely a place to try out!"
4/30/2016,1,"I used to frequent this establishment (at least a couple times per month), but after my last couple times there it's safe to say I'm never going back and they'll never receive a single dollar that I've earned ever again. Let me start off by saying the food is pretty good, but not good enough for me to put up with their terrible customer service. When I went in the store during my last visit I ordered pickup and was not greeted for the first 5 minutes I was there. It doesn't take much energy to greet your customers when they walk into your restaurant.Today was the last straw for me. I was attempting to call in an order and was put on hold for 7 minutes. I completely understand if the store is busy, but in previous restaurant jobs I've had, if we were that busy we would get back on the phone with the potential customer after two minutes and would either ask for a phone number to call back or give them the expected wait time. I am never going back to Bento and will try my best to ensure none of my friends or family ever go back."
9/13/2011,4,"I used to eat here at least once a week when I was working at a law firm right across the street.  I get the same thing every time I go there....Spicy Cream chicken Bento box with all noodles and rice!  So delicious....and their miso soup is fantastic!You get so much food, you either end up over-eating because it's so delicious that you can't stop or you save half of it for lunch the next day.  It's also fairly cheap, which is an added bonus."
2/10/2017,1,This was the worst food experience I've ever had. I was told for a table of 6 our wait time was 15 minutes and the wait ended up being 45 minutes. As soon as my family and I got seated we ordered our food and drinks. We waited an additional 30 minutes and still no food. We had a movie at 9:45 so we just walked out. I didn't have a chance to eat the food but after this experience I don't think I'll ever come back to try the food.
8/22/2019,2,"I'm not one to complain.......and I understand mistakes happen.......but this is the 2nd time in a week that I've placed a to-go order only to get back to the office and realize that it's not correct.  First time, no salad dressing for the salad.  Today, not even CLOSE to the correct order; clearly someone else's order.  I like their food when it's what I order, but this is disappointing."
4/22/2015,4,"Been coming to Bento for lunch for a few years now.  I work in the building and when I need my sushi fix, this is it. It's not the sushi you might get at other, more expensive restaurants but it's fresh, and good.  The spicy tuna, salmon and tuna/salmon dons are great, with spicy mayo, and a little seaweed salad on the side, the fish is always fresh. The spicy cream chicken is another winner, although I can feel my arteries hardening as I eat it.  So it's a splurge for me when I get it.  For a healthier alternative try their Kawaii rolls, wrapped in rice paper and lettuce instead of rice and seaweed. There are five options with varying selections of fish and other ingredients.I usually order to go but when I've dined in it's been great using their check-in special of a free app with $10 purchase (which isn't valid with carryout) for the gyoza which I order fried and is sinfully tasty.  The service can be slow, but the food has always been good."
4/11/2018,3,"After waiting for an hour, the staff was kind enough to provide me my food FREE of charge. They apologized and made sure that I would not be charged for their mistake. Thanks Bento Café"
7/7/2018,5,"My husband and I went here on our Friday night date night. This place was excellent! The sushi is amazing. We had the hot lava roll, the volcano roll, and the Mexican roll! We loved every one of them!! So delicious and the service was great too! This will be a regular date night spot for us!"
7/6/2018,5,"I was here for dinner and everything was fantastic! My server Juan was great. He was very attentive and made sure I enjoyed my dining experience. I had the steamed chicken dumplings which are my new favorite appetizer. Followed by the noodle bowl (lol mein) with spicy cream chicken. The spicy cream is not very spicy which I like. With such amazing hospitality and inexpensive but delicious food, I will definitely be back."
6/26/2018,4,"Their bento boxes include a lot of food and a variety of options to choose from. The bento box includes a lot of different flavors, including spicy (if you choose the main dish to be spicy), salty, sweet (dressing on the salad), and a light dessert (it seems like some sort of fried chips in sweet sauce, tasted good). The service was fairly timely, and it is a good choice for a casual meal. Not too formal or quiet, because a lot of people were there for lunch."
10/4/2010,3,"This is a good place for fast and cheap sushi. If you go here expecting something fancy, you'll be very disappointed. My favorite is the spicy don. It's a bowl of rice with tuna or salmon (or both) and a spicy sauce. It's only $7 and they don't skimp on the fish. Plus, the best part is the boba tea!It's a good choice when you need a sushi fix, but don't have a lot of money."
3/21/2018,5,This is my favorite sushi place of all time. Everyone is always super friendly and the food is incredible!
10/5/2015,3,"Decent food at a price. Counter service to order and pretty quick turn around to food delivered to your table (like Jason's deli style). Good variety (large menu to choose from) at okay taste. It's quick food, and you can tell. Always seems to be busy, so finding a table can be tough. Best to get there early. Today the customer service was lacking -- the cashier gave me an attitude when I asked to substitute out the rice. She did, however, provide the option of double green beans and salad, which was nice."
5/1/2017,3,"So, they forgot to bring out the sushi, which was only remedied by me going to the bar after all the other food had been eaten to find our meals had long been sitting in the window.One of the servers brought it out saying he wasn't sure what was happening, but that he wasn't even  on the clock.To top it off, the guy at the register said they had ""run out"" of parking validation and suggested we go to another restaurant to get it validated, after I had paid for my family of 6 to eat at Bento.Thanks."
11/6/2017,5,Always a great place to grab a quick bite to eat or just get some good sushi. Bento Boxes are yummy! They have great kitchen entrees as well. Saki's are good too! Can't really go wrong here. I've been a fan for a long time. You won't be disappointed. They also have a good happy hour menu! Yum!
5/19/2018,5,"I had a great experience here. The food was really good, and came out with a very short amount of wait time even though we had 14 people in our group. Our server Valerie was pretty amazing too. She was very attentive but also not annoying and I guess she's only been on the floor for a month so her trainer did well also I believe her name was Sarah. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"
6/29/2011,5,"I really like this place because the quality and taste of the food in relation to its prices is simply astonishing. My favorite dish from the place is the rice bowl with seaweed salad and tuna. I cannot tell you enough how good it is. It combines the incredible flavor of seaweed with the tuna, and it's like boom... PERFECTION. If I can recall correctly, the dish costs you no more than $8.00. Their sushi is also good, not the best I've had but good. I like their Bagel Japanese Roll and Mexican Roll."
7/5/2012,3,"Let's start with the location: the restaurant is located in downtown Orlando right underneath the movie theatre. Parking isn't bad, as the garage is nearby and they validate parking. Just keep in mind the time because after two hours the validation is void and you end up paying the general parking fee. There aren't many businesses surrounding the restaurant so for it's location, it's pretty modern and trendy. Bento Cafe is known for its cheap sushi as well as its variety when it comes to the entrees. You can pick between three styles: Bento box, Noodle bowl, or Rice bowl. There's a variety of different styles of entrees, including Thai, Filipino, and Chinese. One thing I noticed is that they no longer have Boba drinks. I've been here a number of times and every time I never get the entrees. Mostly because I find that there are rolls here that I absolutely love and I can't find anywhere else. Another category on their menu that I love is their sushi bowls. Not many other restaurants offer a variety of sushi bowls and are usually limited to Chirashi bowls or Tuna Don. I'm pretty much a fan of their Spicy Tuna and Salmon Don, which I usually request come with brown rice. As far as their basic rolls, I love their Japanese Bagel Roll and Mexican Roll. I have yet to try their Special Mexican Roll, which I'm told is fantastic. As far as their specialty rolls, I really like their Caliente Roll. As if you couldn't already tell, I'm a sucker for spicy food. The reason why I'm not giving a full 4 or 5 stars to this restaurant is because sometimes their service is pretty hit or miss. It mostly has to do with how busy they can get at times. Although it's seat yourself service, sometimes the servers can be slow to get your orders as well as check in on you. The last time I went I'm pretty sure our waiter never checked on us unless we flagged him down. Although I've lived in Orlando for quite some time, I've yet to try the location at Dr. Phillips. Unfortunately for me, it's on the other side of town. Overall, I enjoy coming here with friends and we're just looking to have a good time. I feel like it's a good place to come to with people since there's a variety of food to order."
12/1/2016,3,went for lunch yesterday and ordered the Bulgogi beef add on veggies and a side of extra sauce. Now i had this same dish before and it was slamming! everything was phenominal but i forgot to review it. This time i went i ordered it to go and they forgot the sauce. BOOO i had to ask for it in an awkward way since there was a long line at the cashiers. I got the expediters attention and recieved my sauce. The beef was good and the veggies were cooked well. The sauce however was funky. It had a grittiness to it that i havent tasted before. Almost like powdered sand consistency. It killed the rest of the food. This was a one time thing on the 4 times i have visited. I hope they rectify this for future people. Given this i will still return because the other times i have been were good.
4/21/2018,5,This place never cease to amaze me I am just fond of the memories I have here from the iconic staff members to the delicate yet amazing hand made food
4/5/2015,5,"LOVE bentos. If you're looking for an inexpensive, but quality sushi place, bentos is your last stop. Everyone is always friendly, and I have never had a complaint on my food. I love that they stay open late also!"
12/13/2014,2,When you walk in the menu is at the front. The girl comes over and waits for you to make your decision on the spot before you sit down. It made us feel a little rushed to make all of our decisions. They seemed like they had a lot of great choices but because we were rushed I didn't get a chance to look at all of the sushi. I asked her a couple of questions to help me narrow down and she seemed really bothered. They charge you for the food immediately and I noticed she looked right away at how much of a tip was left. Another thing I didn't like. My first impressions wasn't great. Total for 3 rolls and 2 drinks came out to $48. We then sat down and served ourselves our drinks. That's pretty cool. The sushi was ok.  My best friend and I share a common love for sushi so we like to try different places. The volcano sushi was good. It did seem kind of plain but not disappointing. The Mexican roll was gross I suggest not to have it from here. We both stayed away from that side of our plate.
2/10/2015,5,"What can I say? I'm absolutely OBSESSED with this place. I've been to almost all of their locations and they're all outstanding. From service to quality, you can't get a better combo than this place.My typical go to is the Volcano roll, although during October around Halloween they have a Zombie roll that is, to say the least, amazing. I highly recommend this place if you're in a hurry as well as they kitchen is quite speedy at sending out dishes."
3/26/2015,5,Always a great place to grab a bite with friends. Place has great ambiance and good service. Their sushi rolls are very different from other places and tasty. Always enjoy their boba drinks.
3/31/2018,5,Service was nice and courteous. Food prices are decent. Quality and quantity of the food is fulfilling. Definitely a great place to eat
10/23/2015,5,Had an amazing recommendation of a sushi bowl with crab and tuna by my server Cortney. Amazing service and delicious food! Will definitely be back soon!
12/29/2017,5,Love this place! Couldn't find the menu online so I called and the manager talked me through the menu over so the phone so I could place my order. Super nice! I've only had their sushi and it's delicious. Recommendation: garlic edamame - delicious!!
3/26/2018,1,The seaweed on my sushi was extremely soggy and chewy and I had to spit it out. I also found bits of shrimp shell in my special Mexican roll.
10/5/2012,4,"I was a huge fan of Bentos in Gainesville, so I was happy to see they opened up a location in Orlando. Nice atmosphere, friendly people, and pretty good quality cheap sushi. It's a dream when you add in the fact that they have boba tea as well.The decor is kinda trendy, but not overly pretentious. At night there might be a wait, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth it. The udon soup is a huge, filling bowl of soft noodles, and the tempura that often comes with it is nothing to sneeze at either. I love the dragon roll wrapped in Unagi, my favorite fish. Is eel a fish? Who cares, it's delicious. Fun, cheap place to eat good quality sushi in Orlando. I'll be back. Just park a few blocks away and walk, the parking fee at the complex is in is killer."
7/7/2017,4,"I love the spicy cream chicken rice bowl! I love this place has both sushi and non-sushi options. I'm not a sushi fan but I can go here with my friends who are and everyone is happy. I usually go to the location in Doctor Phillips, so last night was my first time at this one. The location feels a little strange to me. I'm a suburbanite so this place being underneath the movie theater in a little tunnel felt a little dark to me. My chicken seemed a little crispier than normal, but maybe some people like it that way. The service was good, even if our waiter's jokes were a bit awkward. Loved the $1 off coupon for Mochi next door that they gave us with the check."
12/16/2017,5,The tuna poke bowl is the master of all things. I have ordered it countless of times and it always taste so savory each time. I'm not a fan of soybeans but I will eat a hand full of it if it's in the poke bowl
6/29/2015,4,"Just got back from Bento. It was a nice experience. We had 9 people in our party and our server handled the large party very well. We ordered rolls and entrees. They have a large selection of rolls to choose from. She brought our rolls out first before the entrees which was nice. I got the Mexican Roll (shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, eel sauce). I would definitely recommend it. I also got the miso soup which is always very good. The place is kinda small but we fit comfortably. No one in our party had any problems or complaints. I took away one star because I wasn't absolutely blown away. However, if I had guests that were craving sushi I would certainly take them here."
3/6/2015,5,So I must say that I fully enjoyed my experience here the food was awesome. Got a Bento Box. It came out quick along side out spring roll appetizer which was free via Yelp check in. The teriyaki chicken was very tender and full of flavor and the ginger salad was a good top off to clean the pallet. Now I will fully talk up our wait staff Susan who was on top of our service. We were in a rush to catch a show and she made sure to keep on top of things ensuring we didn't feel rushed and out on time. Cudos to Susan probably one of the best wait staff experiences I have gotten from any place in a long time. All in all Bentos deserves these 5 stars.
6/7/2019,2,The place used to be full. Then they went to ordering at the counter. I hate this on a Friday night. Long wait. Wish whoever thought this was better than table service would rethink. If I wanted this experience I'd go to McDonald's
9/3/2017,1,"I'm not sure why this place gets good reviews. The lack of service this place has is interesting, you pay 1st and then sit down at a table with no server. It's like a school cafeteria with woks and sushi. When the food and hot tea was dropped off at the table- the server was a little rude. Literally ""DROPPED"" off at the table, the bowl it made a loud sound as it hit. The girl just walked away without saying anything. Maybe a ""can I get you anything else?"" Would suffice. Do I go to the cash register and ask for ""anything else""? Spoon, hot sauce, another napkin or ice water? Sushi roll was very small for  $11 also. Ehh, 1 star I guess"
9/2/2017,4,You can't go wrong with the sushi box. Just enough food for lunch or a light dinner. The location is perfect to grab a bite then head to the movies or somewhere else. The service can take a bit depending on when you come but a decent place for quick sushi.
3/12/2015,3,"Excellent lunch spot! I love the spicy cream noodle bowl, and when you check-in on Yelp, you get a free app. I can't attest to the sushi because I don't like fish, but the chicken menu items I have tried have been well-portioned, reasonably priced, and very tasty.Downside: Parking (not really convenient unless you are already downtown), the soda machine is frequently (like 50% of the time) out of gas for carbonation or syrup, and the food sometimes takes awhile to come out."
10/22/2017,4,"I love Bento. Their spicy cream noodle bowl never disappoints. Plus, their wait usually isn't too long and it's a nice atmosphere."
4/25/2010,3,"I was foraging for food in downtown Orlando and came upon this place.  Bento is like many places out there that like to fuse sushi with many other types of cuisine (thai, chinese etc.).  Always a dicey prospect in my book.  Either way, this place wasn't too bad.  The decor is decidedly trendy and modern.  Service was pretty fast and friendly.  The prices here are pretty reasonalbe.  Rolls are anywhere from $7-14.  I ended up with the steamed gyoza which was actually pretty tasty and affordable.  A nice sized bowel of I think 5 or 6 dumplings were like $4.50.  Also got the T.N.T. roll which was spicy tuna with tuna on the outside and a dragon roll.  Not a bad choice if you are hungry for more than sandwiches and flatbread in the downton O area."
3/25/2015,5,"One of my favorite lunch spots in Orlando. Can get a bit busy during normal lunch hours, so I'd suggest going around 11:30 to beat the rush. Bento box is awesome, lots of food and cheap too!! Their specialty rolls are good too! Their Mango Tango, Bali Hai Mango, and Dragon sushi rolls are delicious as well!"
7/23/2017,5,Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. We've been to multiple Bento cafes and this location by far is the best one.
9/11/2016,4,The crab wantons were tasty and served right out of the frywe. The Sechquan chicken was yummy with the right amount of  spice. Large portion and the service was good and friendly even though the restaurant was packed. I will return.
9/15/2017,5,"We were craving Japanese food so we stopped by Bentos in Downtown Orlando. OMG best decision ever!!! The best dish of the night was the Poke Bowl! The flavor reminds me when I was in Hawaii! The sushi rolls were delicious! So Fresh! If you haven't tried the Udon Stir Fry's, you don't know what you're missing! The steak Udon Stir fry was my favorite! Ryan the sushi chef was so personable and provided exceptional customer service! Kanpai!"
9/15/2017,5,It was our first time at this place but omg I the food was amazing! We sat at the bar and our sushi chef Ryan was absolutely amazing! Hes the greatest and I'm so happy we stopped by here!
3/21/2011,4,"Creamy Spicy Shrimp bowl!! YUM. I like the fact you can pick between bowls, noodles, or bento box. I chose the bowl. It came with Shrimp and rice. I think they gave a little too much rice but it was still very delicious! It taste like the orange chicken sauce but 10x better. The only thing I was disappointed about was the fact it wasn't spicy at all. But besides that it was great. I think next time I'd get the box because it comes with more side dishes.We also ordered the Salmon Nigiri which was very impressing. Super fresh and just melted in your mouth. I'd definitely come back here."
12/4/2011,3,"Had a party of 7 here on a Saturday night with no reservation.  So luckily, there was great conversations while waiting for a table to clear, because this place was packed.The beer prices are pretty decent here, had an Asahi and a Sapporo and they were a good dollar cheaper here than other places I've been.  A fellow diner had salt with an edamame garnish that she couldn't eat.  I love salt, so I was in heaven.........briefly, then had to quit myself.  Its good but yes, salt is here and fully represented.The seating is very cramped.  Several times throughout dinner, I'd see stranded patrons that went to the bathroom that couldn't make it back to the side of the room that they came from.I have a love/love relationship with inari sushi (the tofu pockets with the sweet sushi rice inside), and this place fixed them perfectly, and the price didn't break the piggy bank.  The red bean ice cream was well done as well,  if you are looking for a break from Mochi Fro-Yo that is neighboring this restaurant.The waitress deserves a special mention as well.  As packed and chaotic as this place was, you'd never notice it in her demeanor.  She was very sweet, offered recommendations over the techno and loud atmosphere.  I wish the receipt had her name, I'd leave it here.This place could totally climb a star if the space issues resolved!"
8/20/2012,4,"The more I come here, the more I try from the menu and the more I like it. I work in the building, and I am often in search of a healthy lunch option so Bento and I were bound to get acquainted.As Brandi B. said, the bento box can be a big ole' salt lick but I usually hit up the bowls - my favorite is the artistically presented chirashi sashimi bowl, a delicious rainbow of sashimi served over rice. The spicy tuna don is my standby bowl when I'm not feeling as feisty. And sometimes I just pop down here and get miso and/or seaweed salad, which is also good. Also, they have a Yelp special right now - free appetizer when you dine in and spend more than $10. Chirashi sashimi bowl is right at that price point. Just sayin'..."
6/22/2017,5,"Casey was awesome at the register. Super helpful accommodating my vegan requests, super sweet. Food was great. Will definitely visit again!!"
4/18/2017,5,"Sushi sushi sushi!! Delicious!! Had the Miami and Bamboo rolls. Previously visited this restaurant back in February and tried their ""Bento box"". Would totally recommend either one. Delishhh!!"
12/10/2011,5,yum yum yum!I love this place and wish there was one in Tampa. This place is a little difficult to find parking since it's in downtown Orlando but once you find a spot it's not hard to find. This one looks really fancy compared to the one in Gainesville but it's really affordable. They have really good food and also specials on certain days. Sushi and bento boxes? What else could you ask for! They give you a pretty good amount of food too.Oh and there's TV's in the bathroom :)
8/8/2017,1,"Paying $11 for a build your own Poke Bowl, with lots to pick from including a choice of rice or lettuce but seriously you can't get half of each?  This is a service industry...this restaurant should grasp the service part...come on."
1/13/2018,4,Was in town on vacation and ordered to-go through uber-bites and got the chicken curry katsu and tuna/salmon/crab rice bowl. Tasted pretty good even though it wasn't uber(haha get it? :D) fresh! Good portion sizes too!
1/1/2015,5,"Good sushi for a good price, right in downtown so perfect place for dinner. They also have rice or noodle bowls and bento boxes."
3/9/2017,1,"I've been going to lunch at Bento for a number of years, but their quality has taken a nose dive.  Today I ordered the create-your-own don with yellowtail.  Most of the fish was inedible - weird consistency and not fresh.  So instead of having sushi for lunch, I ended up with a very big bowl of expensive rice for lunch. Very disappointed."
10/2/2017,5,"Tonight was my first time at Bento and I stopped in for dinner. The food was awesome and not ill priced for how full I walked out of the restaurant. My server Amber was terrific, nice and attentive and the rest of the staff was great too!!"
1/21/2015,5,A little pricey but I absolutely love the sweet and sour shrimp rice bowl.   Call in order and pick up often for lunch fast and always accurate.
6/22/2017,1,"Really disappointed with Bento Cafe. I Ordered lunch with my friend and he finish his food and there was no sign of mine. No actual servers at all, after waiting for 20+ minutes I finally got the two rolls I order and they didn't even care to bring chopsticks, just really bad service. No one seems to care if you're here or not. Probably not coming back."
11/12/2014,4,"Bento is one of my go-to restaurants of choice in downtown Orlando. It's not super cheap, but you do get quite a bit of food for your money and it's generally pretty good quality. In half a dozen visits I've only had one where the service was mediocre-- in fact, if my experience stands up, I'd suggest visiting at lunch on a weekday! The first thing I try at any Asian/Asian Fusion restaurant is always General Tso's chicken. Bento's was good, but it was a little too deep-fried for my taste and they went a little heavy on the sauce. I've since tried the pad thai bento box (very good) and the garlic soy steak rice bowl (also very good) and have resolved to stick to non-fried foods here for the most part. All in all, you can certainly find better Asian Fusion restaurants in Orlando-- but I've enjoyed just about every meal I've had at Bento all the same! Great downtown lunch spot."
11/6/2014,4,"Most of the Bentos I've been to (in Gainesville and Jacksonville) are usually more of a fast foodish type of restaurant but this one in Orlando is more catered for full sit in dining. The ambiance is nice and it's smack dab in the middle of downtown next to all the great bars and the movie theater. The menu is good and the prices are great for the service and the quality of food. At night they have dinner service so it's different from the usual 'seat yourself/self service' type of deal. The only thing is they have only 1 bathroom for each male/female. With the amount of people they have in the restaurant at once you'd think they would have more bathroom stalls. But other than that, the food is good for the price and the location is great. Solid 3.5!"
6/9/2015,4,"I have never been disappointed with lunch @ Bento in the dozen or so times I've been. If you want affordable, the sushi box or bento boxes they offer are all great value and even better flavor. The executive rolls are spot on and worth their cost for what you get. If you're not a fan of the raw, go with a Miami or Spider roll and you won't be disappointed! The Mongolian beef bento box is a must have a some point while you're there.Highly recommend getting there before 11:30am on weekdays as it gets incredibly packed by noon."
6/1/2017,4,So delicious!!! Spicy cream noodle bowl is the best  this place is definitely bigger than the other bentos and in a great location. You have to pay for parking in the garage or drive around downtown to find parking- the only annoying part.
10/21/2016,4,"If you are in downtown Orlando and looking for a fresh meal, this is a great spot to check out. They have a great selection of sushi as well as entrees. I really like their teriyaki chicken bowl and usually get the edamame for an appetizer. Try the edamame with garlic seasoning. It's really good! They have good happy hour specials and the staff is friendly."
8/24/2017,5,"A really nice surprise. Real good food, the staff is nice and efficient. I recommend coming here!"
8/24/2017,5,Great food and sushi. Service can be slow only because it's always packed. Get here before the lunch rush and dinner rush and you'll be fine.
10/27/2014,4,"I love Bento- great sushi, amazing curry katsu, affordable prices. They have lots to choose from as far as food and the boba tea and sake is lovely. The food had been consistently yummy all but one time (I've been about 8 times) however, that one time it seemed very unfresh. I told my waiter and he brought the manager who simply told me ""the chef could be using a different recipe."" Yeah... I think that's unlikely. No offer to fix it or give me a discount or coupon of any kind. He just left. (This was the sandlake location btw) I felt a little betrayed. So normally you can expect super yummy food, but not so great customer service. Otherwise I'd give them 5 stars."
4/18/2017,5,Great!!! Loved it! It was soooo delicious and fair prices!! I got the ahi tuna bowl and it almost melted in my mouth!
3/11/2017,5,"Came into Bento on a Friday night and was seated without a wait. Our server Sylvia was attentive and so nice! We got happy hour which is 4-7pm bogo beer, wine, and house sake and buy two sushi rolls get a classic roll free. What a BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! The sushi rolls were fresh delicious fish and the krab wontons are to die for. Alex brought out our food and he was also extremely nice asking us if we needed any extra sauces or drink refills. All the other staff members we came in contact with were also extremely nice. The atmosphere is young and lively. Overall my bento experience was impeccable and we will be back!"
11/4/2014,5,Our server (Kiki) was really helpful and had the cutest personality. So many great choices! We started out with Krab Cheese Wontons and Shrimp Tempura. Got a couple of rolls which I loved the *Special Mexican Roll. Great quick service!
5/28/2015,4,"Bento cafe is coollllll! I love this location it's right underneath the movie theater so it's ideal to catch a flick before or after. Even if your just passing by and in the mood for thai food. If you come and your not looking for sushi (which I'm sure is good here) you must get a bento box! Includes rice, noodles, salad, string beans, desert, and your entree choice of meat! The spicy cream chicken is to die for not spicy at all maybe a tad if anything but so so good. I wish they would be a little more heavy handed with the noodles but hey all that for like 9 bucks I can't complain! The seating can get crammed if your not in a booth so be aware of that! Besides that I super recommend this place! I look forward to trying their new location at ucf! Go bento!"
9/11/2016,5,Great location and ambiance. The parking garage could be better. Their happy hour from 4-7pm is a great value! BOGO sushi never fails.
2/20/2017,5,"Their miso soup is haunted. Not as in ""I'm haunted by their miso soup"" rather, their miso soup is literally moved by spirits."
6/9/2016,3,"I was not the biggest fan of this location. I did enjoy the food but the service didn't really live up to the expectation. I went there for dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in a little while and we wanted to catch up. Our waiter, however, didn't give us any breathing room. Kept coming back asking if we were ready to order and almost seemed to be rushing us. I didn't understand why the staff was rushing us. Happy hour was already over and no one was really there. There was no reason to rush us. The food however, was pretty good. I ordered the rainbow roll, the mt. fuji roll, and the alaska roll. They were all very good. I also ordered a noodle bowl for work the next day. I really enjoyed that as well. Make sure you are not in a rush, the service and food did take a little while to arrive. The food was good, the service not so much. I'd go back but probably order my food to go next time."
7/12/2017,5,"Came here on Monday night for a late bite to eat and got to say we were thoroughly impressed from the food and service quality. There was a little bit of a wait for the sushi, but our server let us know in advance, which we appreciated. Let me tell you though, it was worth the wait. The sushi was extremely fresh and the roll integrity exceeded our expectations, delicious! A woman with blonde hair (I'm assuming was the manager), cheerfully brought out our rolls, described them to us, and asked if we needed anything else. A nice added touch was she came back around to check on how we were doing and refilled our drinks. It was cool to see the wait staff helping each other out to make the customer's dining experience a memorable one. We will definitely be back to try more rolls."
2/28/2016,4,Came on a Tuesday night before a show at Dr Phillips the place was very busy and just missed happy hiur :( Had to wait for a table but the service was very quick and made up for the wait time. Thought it was odd they had a table reserved but no one showed up for the 45 min we were there. The noodle bowls were delicious and asked for extra white (yum yum) sauce and eel sauce on the side.
12/1/2013,5,"Went back... After Shari too expensive, me only, non team atmosphere at Amura...Asked my server at sushi bar for make a bento, just hamachi (yellowtail), large sashimi cut, not diced, extra meat and it was outstanding, fresh and brightly affordable...Ordered Tako (cooked octopus) (sashimi) it was great, expertly cut, crisp wuth great texture.Green tea ice cream was ample, smooth and creamy...The team service was as good as service gets...My server was the GM, Alex from Venezuela, she us outstanding professional...Alex said she revamped the staff in late October ...Great visit one of my very best in Orlando...Up there with Kres, Shari and The Palm..."
4/21/2017,4,"I LOVE this place, been going to it for years. The only downside is the food quality isn't always consistent. The last two times I went, my tofu had a subtle freezer burn taste but other than that, great astmophere and food."
1/2/2019,5,"I Miscommunication and order, they were very helpful in getting me back on track. Great customer service. Thanks, manny"
10/15/2016,4,The food is reasonable and fast however it lacked the authentic Asian seasonings associated with a bento box. However we tried the pumpkin wantons and they were a hit with my group.  I probably would visit another location see if the food is a little better.
3/22/2017,5,"Very busy at lunch but food is good and reasonably priced, Szechuan beef noodle soup and veggie spring rolls were both tasty and big portions, right under the movie theater in Cobb Plaza downtown"
3/17/2017,5,This is by far the most consistent place for quality sushi in Orlando.  The staff is always very friendly.  I happen to be within walking distance and rarely wait to be seated.  Quality food and a great location!
12/17/2017,2,"I'm giving two stars because the food is pretty good and because I generally have a good enough experience at lunch or when I order takeout. HOWEVER, two of my friends and I went for dinner tonight and were treated so poorly. At dinner, this Bento location feels the need to pretend to be fancy and have waiters bring food instead of having people order at the counter. That would be fine if any of the staff appeared to be trained for that. The service started poor and only got worse. The soda came out flat and, when we asked our waiter about it, he said the CO2 was out and he'd get us new sodas when it was fixed. We waited 10 minutes before asking him about the soda. He told us he ""didn't know"" whether the soda had been fixed, but that ""it doesn't look like anyone has touched the machine."" We asked for waters instead. It took another 10 minutes for our waters to come. In the meantime, our waiter got drinks for other tables and played around on the register. Later, about 30 minutes after ordering food, we were informed that there was a problem with the kitchen and that our food was delayed. While we waited, the seemingly-large staff all stood around looking confused. It took a total of about 40 or 45 for the food to come. In the meantime, the table behind us left and the server was obviously rude to them as they did. It was really awkward. We were never offered anything for the extensive wait, lack of carbonated drinks, or terrible service."
2/10/2017,5,"The service I receive here supersedes my expectations with Kevin the sushi man, always smiling and making sure perfection. Always reaches my table. He ensures everything is the same and super seeds company standard he is someone who should be emulated and Nicole and Sheri supported his service to maximize my experience. When I came johnna  also made me say wow with the service she gave."
1/9/2017,5,I love this place! The bento boxes are perfect for when you want variety- aka- the spice of life! They have small servings of noodles rice salad veggies and even dessert with your entree choice. I like the fact that I get a little bit of everything.  I have eaten in the restaurant but the last time I ordered through uber eats and the food was just as good. Overall good but I would suggest being careful about when you show up to all you can eat sushi- if you show up too close to the end they wont let you join in.
5/20/2016,1,"Didn't get what I ordered, but the employee left so quickly I didn't get a chance to say anything. I'd waited so long and I was so hungry that I just ate what was brought and left."
1/1/2016,4,"Been to their Gainesville location and usually get curry Katsu chicken noodle bowl. Entre was decent, other location usually gives more sauce so felt it was kinda dry, still tasted fine but I personally prefer more sauce since I like spicy taste."
12/12/2016,5,"My boyfriend and I had an incredibly satisfying meal at Bento. After a long day at the parks, we were craving fresher and healthier food and found Bento after searching downtown for something that fit the bill. We both ordered bento boxes and split an order of edamame and a cucumber avocado roll. The bento boxes come with a salad, lo mein, string beans, rice, an entree, and a small dessert item. My boyfriend got the garlic soy chicken and I got the vegetable stirfry with tofu. Both of our meals were delicious! We enjoyed our meal so much we returned the next night!Bento Cafe was the perfect meal after a long day. The food was very fresh and the price was excellent. We both were satisfied and spent less than $30. We highly recommend Bento for those looking for a great meal in dowtown Orlando."
5/29/2015,2,"Oh, Bento Café, I had such high hopes for you.  I had eyed the Bento Café location in Gainesville while there on business but my coworker chose another dinner option, but I kept Bento in mind.  The concept of the menu - different meat and sauce selections for a wide range of Asian dishes with bento box-style options for all - sounded so amazing.  I visited this location with my Mom and husband for a pre-hockey dinner.  We started with Krab Wontons and fried chicken dumplings.  The wontons were good, but a bit heavy on cream cheese.  As for the dumplings, they were wonderfully crisped on the outside, but the filling was a little underseasoned.  However, the dipping sauce was quite good.  For entrees, we had quite a mix at our table, though we all went for the bento style serving.  My mother did the Red Curry with chicken, I did the Mongolian Beef and my husband went for the Bulgogi with beef.  Unfortunately, here's where the problems started.  The Red Curry, which my mother wanted fairly hot, simply was not and was overall a muddled curry without prominent flavors.  My Mongolian beef was supposed to come in a sweet hoison sauce but what I got was sickly sweet and didn't taste much like hoison.  My husband's bulgogi came in a sauce with additional ""Korean bbq"" sauce on the side.  I have no idea what the side sauce was supposed to taste like but it was much more like an American BBQ sauce than anything vaguely Korean.  He ended up asking for a different sauce on the side as the provided sauce didn't taste good on it's own or with the seasoned beef.  The additional items included on the bento were okay, but nothing amazing.  In the end, NONE of us finished our portions as the sauces were just not good and grew worse in flavor as we ate.  It's a sad day when none of us finish our dinner and we ended up getting a snack halfway through the game.  Oh well, I guess on a high note, I'm not sad anymore that we don't have one of these in Tampa."
7/2/2018,1,"I ate lunch with my husband today at bento cafe. I ordered the lunch sushi combo and he got a  teriyaki pork bowl. His food came out at least 10 minutes before mine. I wasn't mad about it but it was a little awkward. Fast forward 1/2 way through the meal, and he found a sharp piece of plastic in his food. A server quickly took the bowl away and offered to have the food re-made. We would have rather talked with the manager or had the food taken off our bill because unfortunately the food wasn't good to begin with. The California and rainbow rolls I got are best described as ""very ok"". I also got a philly roll, which contains smoked salmon, but they made it with imitation krab instead. I really dislike conflict and leaving poor reviews, but our whole experience at bento was so dissatisfying and gross. Spend your money at a different downtown sushi spot."
7/1/2016,2,"It makes me sad to do a two star review... Honestly, the food is good 95% of the time. The service however... I'm not even talking table service-I live in the plaza so I order takeout often. I have waited 40 minutes in store after 20 minutes or pre-ordwring because they refused to check the bag that had been ready since I walked in to see if it was my order. Whaaaatttt?? Today I call, yes, 15 minutes before they close but based on that one experience, I know their door stays open... They tell me no take out. I can only do counter service at the restaurant. I tell them where I live... They apologize and say oh well. So I ask if I can order downstairs. Sure can. Ok---seems weird. I make it before they lock their door a few minutes early. They do seat those who come in ten minutes before their closing, which made me wonder why they wouldnt do take out. They also claim you can get one sauce per meal, but if you order to-go, they'll only give you one if you ask in advance. So wait until you've ordered and paid so they HAND IT to you separately. Otherwise, it'll not be in your bag."
6/16/2013,4,"My second time here but now making a review. This place is sort of small and if you are scared of tight places then its not the place for you. I tried the garlic mushroom... with carrots, mushroom and add shrimp in a rice bowl... Just like they have back home in Pennsylvania at all the asian buffets. Sadly down here most restaurants don't have it on their menu. The shrimp was a good kind and not the horrible stuff with the extra string you get at most asian restaurants.This place is really good and competitively priced. Its a shame they don't have more of a space. They make do with the room they have but still. Its hard to find a decent asian restaurant around here.Sushi rolls were priced between $8 - $10 and had a wide selection. There is something for everyone here even if you are like me and hate soy sauce and chopsticks."
11/7/2014,5,I love bentos!!! They have amazing sushi and bento boxes!!! They get super busy at lunch! Nice location/right in down town.
12/31/2013,4,"Bottom line - great place for a nice lunch downtown.While I found the sushi here to be pretty good, I love the bento boxes.  My favorites are the Bulgogi beef and chicken teriyaki.  The place can get pretty crowded for lunch and dinner, but service is generally good and the food is prepared quickly.  Overall, no complaints from me about Bento."
5/27/2016,2,"Their food is decent, but the service is horrible.  The last time I went to grab lunch with my boyfriend there were 3 employees gathered at the front and ignored us for a few minutes, finally one of the girls told us to seat ourselves (despite the Please Wait to Be Seated sign they had up).  When we found our seat we watched the waiter walk by us several times, make eye contact and continue to ignore us.  By the way, there were not many other customers in the place at the time so they definitely weren't too busy.  After waiting almost 30 minutes to be acknowledged we stopped him as he was going to walk by us again and he told us ""I didn't know you were there"" I could go on and on but long story short, worst service experience I've had in a very long time.  The other times I've been there weren't much different. Good luck w/ this place."
6/9/2015,1,"Used to love love Bento until recently when I wanted to take a more healthier approach to my sushi rolls.  Any other sushi place would gladly substitute the rice for cucumbers-not bento! I was told the chef can't do that anymore bc it takes to much time and the only roll your allowed to have cucumber on is the ""k"" roll. Not a happy customer. Our waitress was very kind and polite, but was so sad I couldn't get my sushi roll substituted for cucumbers.  Sorry bento but I will not be returning this was the second time I was denied. - so many other great spots that will bend over backwards to make customer healthy and happy."
6/29/2016,5,"Awesome happy hour specials from 4-7.  Buy one, get one appetizers, rolls and drinks.  We went twice last week.  Excellent chicken dumpling and I love the special Mexican roll.  Crab Rangoon is decent, but I would only buy on BOGO.  Good customer service and in the heart of downtown."
6/29/2013,4,"This is one of my favorite places in Orlando!  I've been here probably over a dozen times.  It's pretty inexpensive and has a cool atmosphere.  I love going here for dinner before catching a movie upstairs at the Plaza Cinema.To start, I usually get the garlic edamame and miso soup.  You can't go wrong with one of their Bento boxes, which comes with a small salad, tiny dessert, noodles, main entree, and rice, all for eight dollars!  My favorite bento boxes include the pork tonkatsu and the coconut curry.  Their sushi is great as well.I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good mixed-asian restaurant downtown.The only downside is the seating area is kind of cramped.  Some of the tables are put together too closely."
10/1/2009,4,"Boba Teas! I love them! This is actually the first thing I think about Bento, not their sushi.  If you are a fan of Boba/Bubble Teas, Bento is where you need to be.  The key here is to try try more, and explore, and open your senses to all sorts of flavors.  Instructions on how to order a Boba Tea: 1) Pick whether you want milk, green, red or thai tea 2) Choose whether or not you want to add pearls (I like to call them ""balls"" - they are made from a mixture of tapioca and carrageenan powder). These fall to the bottom of your drink, but with each sip you taste several pearls. 3) Choose your Boba flavor: Banana, Chocolate, Peach, Coffee, Mango, Pineapple, Strawberry4) Then enjoy the essence of an eclectic tea made just for you. You won't want to stop! In addition Bento has tons of different types of rolls and dishes as they are known to be ""Asian Fusion"" type of food, but don't leave there without a Boba Tea. Just from writing this, I think I am going to create a gathering to do a tasting of different boba teas :)"
7/14/2009,3,"We stumbled upon Bento Cafe as it was one of the handful of late night options when we were starved and wandering the streets of downtown Orlando.Asian fusion usually leads down treacherous or comfortable paths and we were equipped for either.We definitely weren't going anywhere near the sushi, but the noodle bowls, rice bowls and otherwise nonrisky offerings certainly fit the late night bill.  I didn't take the decor to be indicative of the quality or price point of the food. It's fast food playing dress up. It looks hip and trendy, but It's meant to be casual and cheap. Portions were generous and two adults ate dinner for $15. No complaints from this critical Yelper. The cheery and friendly service definitely enhanced our experience."
9/23/2012,3,"We chose Bento Cafe because it was the only logical, pre-drunk place to eat at between 55W and our destination of I-Bar. We were celebrating a friend's birthday, and with each passing year one gains wisdom, specifically the knowledge that it's good to lay down a solid foundation in the gut before filling it up with cheap liquor.The food is good and cheap. I enjoyed a bento box filled with General Tsao's chicken, white rice, noodles, ginger salad, overcooked green beans and a tiny little cake. I also had a Mexican Roll (tempura shrimp, avocado, eel sauce) that was a little on the stingy side considering it cost $6.50. The Chinese food was just a notch better than what you would get at any walk-up place, but my friends' noodle bowls looked delicious. I was uncomfortably full and happy for less than $15.The saving grace is the food, because this place is just off somehow. The space is tiny and hot as Hell. Honestly, so many tables are packed in that it has to be a fire code violation. I often had to scoot my chair in to let somebody squeeze past me to use the bathroom, an annoyance because I'm not much of a scooter.Service is also bizarre. Our waitress was either tripping on mushrooms or had just arrived from another planet. There were times where she would stand at the edge of our table not saying a word and looking at us in disbelief as if she couldn't believe we were really there. She brought us the wrong food, realized her mistake, and took it away so it could be given to the proper diners (she trusted that we hadn't sneezed on it). In the end, she decided not to charge us for our beers and sodas for some reason I wasn't really listening to, so we tipped her. The one thing I may never forgive Bento Cafe for is the bathroom. It was a tragedy. I had to wipe myself with a paper towel, Bento Cafe. A paper towel! I flushed said paper towel in case you're having some plumbing issues.This place is good for large, cheap portions. Just make sure you bring your own toilet paper."
6/1/2009,4,"Bento initially opened in Gainesville around 2002 and I became a fan back then, because it was cheap and it was good--but you have to understand why it's good. Needless to say, I was happy when it opened in Orlando.I think people who give it low ratings just don't understand what the restaurant is all about. Sure, they're look like a dine-in upscale place now because of the decoration and location, but Bento is just Asian fusion FAST food. As far as I know they make no claims to fine dining.Bento is great for what it is: the cooked dishes. They have their version of a bento box, noodle bowl, or rice bowl. The menu has a variety of selections ranging from Japanese to Thai, like curry katsu (with their own sauce) , japanese curry, seafood soup, spicy seafood, vegetables, pork, chicken, five spice pork, etc... The spicy stuff there is generally good. I like the spicy gyoza (dumplings).Did I mention that it's all under $10??? Yes, that means two noodle bowls are under $16. It's completely worth it for a casual meal.Don't go there to get sushi--if you do, that's your mistake. But then again, I am picky about sushi and prefer to go to a real Japanese restaurant for that. I've only tried their chirashi (pieces of sashimi on a bowl of rice) before, which for the price was worth it (it's $9-10 I think...they changed prices recently), as it accompanies beer well. If you fancy rolls maybe you should try it and let me know what you think, as they have a wide choice of rolls. (But beware as this is where the pricing goes up.) Reiterating my opinion once more, sushi is not what they're about. They're about all the fast food I love from east Asia and can't find here....As for the cleaninless and service, I do agree that they need to clean the tables a little better. But given that I usually eat there during self-service hours, I don't mind too much, as I am not forced to tip.I never had a problem with the service though I understand the comment about the alacrity of the waitstaff. I recommend you try again. The food is usually ready quickly."
6/8/2009,3,"So we visited Bento again, and this time we tried more of the sushi rolls. I have decided that if you stick to the rice and noodle bowls the place earns 4 stars. The sushi earns 2 stars. If you haven't had good sushi you'll be satisfied with the sushi at Bento. I thought it was bland and prepared without much skill. In fact, we found a shrimp tail in one bite where there shouldn't have been one! Rolls are loose and the ingredients are not as fresh as at other sushi restaurants nearby. I still like the noodle bowls best, and they are a good price for what you get. The bowls aren't anything fancy but they are tasty. Don't bother with the sushi and you'll leave happy. Tip for parking... The restaurant is only given a certain number of validation tickets for the garage. When they are gone they're gone. Make sure you ask for yours at the beginning of the meal; we got the last one of the night! And they should do something about what the play on their TVs. For 30 minutes I was forced to watch a belly dancing infomercial. Everywhere I looked I saw it, even in the bathroom! It was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the conversation! Horrible!!"
1/21/2016,5,"So yummy! I got the shrimp tempura (was not warm, which I am used to but still very good), chicken tempura  (def exceeded my expectations and was my favorite), and California roll (good simple backup just in case :) ). It was buy 2 rolls get 1 free, so of course I had to get 3. Not expensive and very nice atmosphere :)"
3/12/2018,5,"I go to this location all the time. Tonight my order was incorrect. I called back and Casey was so kind as to correct it, give me a credit, and all while having the KINDEST demeanor. Thank you for your pleasant service. You have retained a loyal customer. See you soon!"
3/1/2015,4,This is a pretty good Bento. They have a variety of food here but the restaurant is normally packed. So expect a little bit of a wait. I like this Bento because it is a good location and is pretty much within walking distance of most of the major sites in downtown.  I am completely vegan and have severe food allergies and I mention this so you will know what my perspective is when I review this restaurant.  They have several different vegan options for you enjoy.  I enjoyed the sushi and the rice bowls.  They have a sweet sake that is amazing here of course I can't remember the name. Be careful if your vegetarian or vegan because some of their rice and noodle bowls although they say vegetarian actually have meat stock in them. If you inquire to your server as to which ones have the stock in it you can successfully make your choice.
8/3/2010,2,"This place was not what I expected.  It's in a pretty ""trendy"" location and it looks expensive.  So my first surprise was that it's actually pretty cheap.  I ordered a Bento Box (combo platter) with a selection of a few different ""easy"" rolls - California, Tuna, Philly, etc.  The problem was that I could not identify what roll was what by taste.  They ALL tasted like a dried out, Publix-quality-sushi, bland roll.  The only flavor that they had was the soy sauce and wasabi that I dipped them in.One bonus - they will validate your parking.  That's the only good thing about this place.  I was sorely disappointed by my experience here!"
11/8/2015,4,"I love everything on their menu. And their fish is such good quality. Everything is super delicious, and super fresh. I've never had anything that I didn't like on their menu. This location and the one by Universal Studios are both great."
8/11/2018,5,Excellent service. Love the food and the server was great with us. Juan got a excellent recommendation sushi and everything.
8/18/2009,1,"Bad food. Bad service.Even if the food & service were good, the music is so loud you wouldn't be able to hear your company, anyway.I had the coconut curry chicken rice bowl, and while the rice was fine (how can you mess up rice?) - the curry chicken was terrible. It smelled like a port-o-potty. It was so repulsive that smelling it made me lose my appetite all together. Gross. My friend had General Tso's chicken bento plate...it was ok. The meat just didnt taste fresh. I was hoping that after my dinner did not turn out - that maybe it was only mine, and that my friend's would be in the so/so range...but no, not really. The service was terrible. Took 20 minutes to take drink orders, the food took forever to come out and it was low quality when it did- I mean, if you spend that long making something, shouldn't it be good? Oh, and they never did the stop-by-check-on-you thing, to see how everything is going/refill water/etc. If they did, maybe I could have ordered something else....(ha, and been let down)I do need to clarify that the people who did finally come around to serve were friendly - its the taste and timing of it all that was so horrible. Would not return. Would not recommend. This is more like fast food chinese...but even that has tasted better than this place."
8/10/2009,3,"Casual sushi/fusion in the heart of the new Plaza downtown.After some deliberation, I decided to try the sushi and settled on the Envy roll and the Mt Fuji roll. The sushi was adequate but not phenomenal, especially compared to nearby Amura (a favorite) and Ichiban. Better than Publix and Bikkuri for sure.The atmosphere is very come-as-you-are, which may lend itself to more downtown traffic, but it's not a great place to take a date you want to impress. The clear plastic solo cups they serve your drinks in is a major no-no in my book. Are we at a picnic here? Service was pretty good.I'll go back to try the noodle bowls, but I may skip the sushi. Recommended if you're under dressed for a more upscale sushi/asian fusion experience, or as part of your movie going experience in the attached theater. They validate parking for the adjacent garage, and there are happy hour specials everyday as well."
2/1/2012,3,"This place was pretty ok. it felt like the Olive Garden of sushi restaurants. Smack in the middle of busy downtown, the decor isn't that fantastic, the service is friendly enough but the food felt assembly line processed and preserved. It's good enough if you're looking for some cheap-ish sushi downtown. I'll probably end up there again."
4/22/2013,4,"Me and the GF spend at least 2-3x/month at Bento. Good food, great price, great atmosphere. I have tried lots of things here but my faves are:Spicy Tuna Don (like a deconstructed sushi roll in a bowl)Kuwaii rolls (sushi wrapped in lettuce that taste good and are low carb)Red Curry Chicken (spicy and DELISH)Pad ThaiRangoons appetizer (great way to start a meal)Pot stickersSpecial Mexican rollMexican roll (yea we like these and they're good for non-sushi people)General Tso's (can you ever go wrong with this)Noodle bowls (preferably with the aforementioned red curry chicken...it ROCKS)Garlic edamameThat is an unofficial list and have had more but I can say that I am never unhappy with the spicy tuna don and a Mexican roll."
3/25/2015,3,"Love Bento Cafe, but this last time my daughter and I ate here prior to seeing Harry Connick Jr in concert, and the wait time was RIDICULOUS. The waitress was amazing and went a long way towards improving my mood, however"
1/5/2011,4,"This is a perfect pre-goingoutdowntown dinner spot, especially for the ladies. Most of the food is pretty light so you won't be bloated when leaving Bento and you'll still feel and look fab in those skinny jeans. Did I really just say that? Anyways, one of my favorites is the ""low carb"" Kawaii Rolls. They have no rice and no seaweed but are wrapped in lettuce and rice paper. It's a quick, fast, and cheap sushi place. Food is good, service is *usually* fast and accurate, and the atmosphere is pretty chill, except for on the weekends. It can get pretty packed and noisy in there on a Friday or Saturday night. They usually have drink specials Thursday - Sunday, not sure about food, it's already so cheap anyways."
4/18/2010,5,"Bento what can I say.  Everything about this place works for me.  I have been going to Bento for a few years now.  They have great lunch specials and the sushi is always fresh.  This is the type of place you can walk in, hand them a sum of money and let the chefs get creative.  I know this from experience.  Every time I walk in, they acknowledge me and my sushi is always on point.  The staff is very attentive, and the chefs are awesome.  I take my friends here all the time and great for groups.  The sake and beer selection is great too!  Make sure to try a Bento box or any of the Executive rolls!"
11/7/2015,3,"Decent. Got the chirashi bowl and a side of the shrimp tempura. Not the best sushi, but not the worst either.I'll add it to my list of places to eat sushi in downtown Orlando, though!"
4/11/2012,1,"I came to THIS Downtown location because I had fantabulous times and the Dr. Phillips location. I figured hey it's 9 miles from me, it should be stellar too. When I went by myself it was excellent. It was a  late lunch, the waitress in a good-customer-service style, was timely and attentive. Regular great service you should expect.WARNING the following is pretty brutal and true story: Rate [ I ] for IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED!Soooo I bring my friends to the restaurant a few weeks later. They love sushi and Asian fusion food. Both are Asian (one Filipino and the other Korean)  they know their  home flavors. We got to our seats fairly quickly. Time to order the drinks. We wanted boba tea drinks but for some reason they sent us out to buy the drinks next door at the yogurt shop(which seems to be all under the same umbrella of business) that was a definite turn off because at the Dr. P location they have the boba drinks in the menu (as they did also at this location at the time) but we made the best of it, hey its a ladies night.Finally when we returned, I ordered a chicken rice bowl- that I will get into shortly- and my favorite kawaii rolls. My friends both ordered sushi and bento boxes.  The sushi and kawaii rolls was very good and at great prices $7-$9.After a few moments I see my friends slowing their pace of eating their food. I asked ""is your food good?"" and in a clenched smile, my friend said "" Yeah its ok""(to apparently be polite)  I told her ""Girl you aint fooling anyone, you are upset"" and she confessed that it wasn't the right flavor. It was supposed to be Korean spicy pork and it tasted bland and more American-Chinese in seasoning (she is a great Korean cook, she knows her stuff).  I totally get that it's fusion but it is still disappointing.Then that opened the door to my other friend admitting that she too was disappointed with her meal... She has high blood pressure and the food was too salty to her taste. You think it stops there, but when it rains it pours. Three catastrophes is the charm. I am eating my TASTY rice bowl when I find... tun tun tun A HAIR! Yes a less than an inch long straight black hair (I'm a hair dresser's daughter , grew up in family salons, I KNOW HAIR) I am a reasonable person I try to look at both sides of a story or 3 or 5! I thought ""is it my hair?"" I don't want to jump to any unnecessary conclusion. The oddity of it was that it was within the rice, not on top or on the side and at the time I had curly dark brown long hair with no bangs. (I feel like I am giving an eye-witness account to the foodie--cops) after discussing it with the girls and getting their opinion we decided to talk to our Ambivalent waiter(whom may or may not have been his first day on the floor on his own), then informed him of our unhappiness and the HAIR! He called his Manager  over and we talked to them calmly. We didn't really want anything but to be satisfied with our chosen meals.They countered-talked us... Which I always find offensive. Then the  Manager (who waited on me the last time)  felt compelled to say "" well you had a great experience last time right?"" well I never said anything to trigger that remark, but I agreed politely.  I especially found it too much when they tried to tell me that it wasn't even hair... LIKE I said I know hair!! Finally they offered us  to replace or food  with some other food and replace my food fresh, but we lost our appetite. I was so disgusted I didn't want to look at rice  or I would really toss my cookies( and I LOVEEEEEEE RICE) They gave us our money back for the meals. We paid for the sushi and left feeling rather violated. It was a truly unsatisfactory experience.BACK TO NICEI did go back way later, like 7 months later, and only ordered sushi because we were all going to a concert at Firestone and could confirm that the sushi is decent.  But I'm not inspired to return anytime soon. I will however go to the Dr. Phillips location! No need to explain the one star.I hope this story makes you aware to check your food and ALWAYS speak up when you are not satisfied.  I think if anyone is respectful a positive outcome may happen."
7/8/2014,3,"Went there this past weekend. Liked the food and the suishi was better than I've had at most places. Kind of waited a while to eat once I got there, but worth it, because the food was filling!I would def recommend!"
1/11/2013,4,"Bento is a frequent place I visit here in Orlando. I love coming here! I specifically enjoy the K roll, Crunch roll, Volcano roll, and dynamite roll. Out of all the sushi spots I've tried, I really enjoy their ginger salad the most. The miso soup is always good - never too salty. Over the past few months they've been featuring an all you can eat sushi on Saturday afternoons. Pretty good deal - soup/salad, as well as a selection of rolls to choose from (a decent selection too). It's impossible to get in here for lunch during the week, but otherwise, it's not usually hard to get a spot. And if you have to wait it's not for long usually. I've always had a pleasant experience with the servers and overall service at Bento. Love coming here!"
7/15/2015,3,I was down the street at the hospital and decided to meet a friend for lunch.  They have a good selection of rolls to choose from and various sets to try.  The prices were about what you would expect.  Overall I tried two rolls and it was not bad.
2/17/2011,3,"2 Stars for the Bento Box.Why? Saaaaaaaaaalt. Salty, saltish, salt-lick like. Salt.The Mongolian Beef Bento Box's main dish-the beef-was tasty. Not overly salty. Nice and sweet, tender beef. The plain white rice- also not salty. But...The ginger dressing for the mixed greens salad, the noodles, and the green beans were all kinds of sodium infused. And I LOVE salty/savory stuffs, but it was too much. 3 Stars for the Sweetheart Roll.Salmon and tuna top off a rice papered roll of tempura shrimp, cucumber, avocado,  and a not too spicy spice. Very tasty. Glad to have read Colleen's recent review that didn't make the sushi here sound scary. But....The pickled ginger which comes with all sushi was also a total freaking salt lick! And the tiny, overpriced egg rolls were ridiculous. In a bad way. So, next time, I'll just order more sushi!!P.S.When you go for lunch, you order at the counter, pay, seat yourself, get your own drinks. Dinner is more full service."
9/24/2016,4,"We are from OKC and we really really love their Chicken teriyaki & streak udon stir fried, ohhh and nice service also !!!"
1/24/2010,4,Inconsistent service but good food. Inexpensive option when you're downtown and looking for something more than fast food. Lots of vegetarian options but be careful and ask. Bento box noodles are made with chicken broth and Japanese curry / all soups are non-vegetarian.I love the Korean Spicy and Soy Chili tofu. Haven't tried sushi yet but they do have several vegetarian options...
1/21/2015,4,"Bento has become my new favorite place for Sushi in Orlando. I absolutely love the Special Mexican and Red Dragon Rolls. It's also a great place to take a Sushi hater, like my partner in crime, so they can order non-sushi grub. The service can be slow at times. If you park in the garage they only validate for 90 minutes. They usually offer a check-in deal to Yelpers."
1/13/2018,4,The ambience was nice. But you have to order your food at the counter and there are no servers so it takes away from the experience.
10/10/2009,3,The bento box meals are pretty good. the prices are cheap for downtown. Other than that it doesn't define itself very well in a city overflowing with great choices for asian food.
6/16/2018,1,"Over glorified chinese fast food. Rice is over cooked, chicken was dry, but swimming in over seasoned sauce, vegetables were soggy. I ate it 15 minutes ago and I already have bad belly grumbles. Not worth it. (Sesame chicken bento box )"
7/20/2010,2,"I have 3 good things to say about this place:              *They validate your parking              *The decor is pretty trendy and sleek              *It's right in the center of downtownAsian fusion has become a really trendy thing. I don't believe just because something is trendy, food quality should be sacrificed.  I can't really testify for the sushi because I'm not a sushi fan. I had sweet and sour chicken which was probably the worst I've had anywhere. It was chicken with sauce from a bottle. No vegetables or anything. To me the food quality doesn't match the location or decor. If you're looking for good, cheap Asian fusion try Pei Wei...a little further out of downtown but MUCH better food."
10/24/2010,2,"TER.RI.BLE. The only good thing they got going for them is the food.Went their last night to have dinner with some friends( 10 of us) in the downtown location because it was closer to the event we were attending. After we received menus and drinks it took our server ""Jaime"" a good 15 minutes to acknowledge us again. When I asked her who was taking our orders she had a slick, sarcastic response. I asked for Boba tea early on and they simply just stopped making them. I'd much rather drive 25 more minutes to the Dr. Phillips location were the service is 10x's more efficient and they STILL HAVE BOBA TEA. In the Dr. Phillips location I wont have to worry about snappy waitresses and bad service.The validation issue is also a pain in the butt and not worth the trouble."
3/16/2011,3,"I'm not gonna lie, I eat Bento often. They have good sushi and 9 times out of ten it's super fresh. My three things while eating sushi that are important to me are; freshness, tightly wrapped rolls, and good eel sauce. and they've got all of that.I recommend getting your sushi to go rather than staying in ; although, the place is pretty cool looking inside. I say this because out of the 30 times I've eaten there the service has been terrible. You'll sit around forever while waiting for anything at all, and the servers always forget something or just kind of ignore you. I'm not saying they aren't nice broads, they are, but they are forgetful- even on a slow day. I've been going there for a few years and out of that time I have had ONE good server. I might be a little critical, because I work as a server/ bartender, but that also means I'm very lenient and try to take in everything that is happening.Anyways, I'd eat there again- I probably will this week, but I'll call in y order and have it to go.They also have some noodle dishes that are decent, but I've had better. and the seaweed salad is good, prices are pretty good, and make their edamame correctly which is good, because somehow there are places that screw that up."
4/16/2015,5,Absolutely LOVE Bento at the Amway Center.  Honestly the BEST thing in the concessions.   I am thinking about buying season tickets for the Solar Bears next year and I would be DEVASTATED if you were no longer there.  PLEASE come back next season!!!!
12/20/2015,2,"So disappointed! This is usually a good place but lately their service has really suffered.  First,  we had to wait for a table though we saw tables available (they didn't appear to be reserved). Then I ordered the hamachi kama and instead of telling me that she didn't understand what it was, she rung up the wrong order. I had to wait for them to cook the right order while my party was eating their meal. When the bill came, they didn't comp me anything. And, in top of that, when I asked them to validate my parking, they didn't!  Not sure if I'll ever return now."
7/29/2014,5,"I love, love, love this place!My friends literally are so tired of hearing me ask them to come eat with me like 5 times a week here! I usually make it once a week and I am always trying new things, I have yet to be disappointed."
8/16/2010,4,"After several visitations to the Bento red cafe in Dr. Phillips I decided to try Bento blue cafe in downtown a try. The service is alot more upbeat in this location so an additional star gets granted for the quick witted service.The bento boxes are just as yummy and price reasonable as the other location. The stir fry noodles balance out the plain set rice with the seasoned veggies. Their boba tea is mighty creamy, not over the top sweetened just right. They just put a tab bit more tapioca pearls here than any other boba place I tried. I am delighted this place closes at 10:30 p.m it's perfect for the 9 pm boba set cravings that no other place in Orlando can serve. Overall cheap, hip, and a delightful place to bring in friends. Cool blue dragon bento is my preferrable bento choice.Even thought the veggy spring rolls are as skinny as my fingers..I still kinda like you guys lol."
8/11/2009,3,"I think I've finally cracked the Bento code. The key here is to go for lunch, when the cafe only offers counter service. The menu is the same, the prices are the same, but you don't have to wait 15 minutes for the server to refill your drink because you refill it yourself! On my first visit, I got the garlic chicken Bento box. Skip the boxes ... they are really big, and while you get plenty of food, only about half of the sides are any good (and the little puff pastry is downright awful.) The garlic chicken itself tasted quite good, but the chicken had that strange, inexpensive Asian white meat texture. I would recommend instead any of the dishes as a rice bowl or noodle bowl. Even though you don't get any sides, they are plenty of food and you won't walk away hungry. Thumbs up on the flavor of the Cajun chicken rice bowl (although, again, the texture was slightly weird). There was also a good-sized pile of green beans in the bowl, so the dish didn't feel too starchy with all of the rice. If Bento offered brown rice, this would be the perfect lunchtime dish. I've heard very mixed things about the sushi, both from people I've dined with and friends who have gone separately. Most comments hang out in the ""okay but not a standout"" neighborhood. The boba teas are a real treat ... give them a go if you want something a little different. Overall, Bento is a solid three stars. If they can speed up their evening service, I think they will have found a comfortable niche in the downtown dining scene."
9/2/2015,5,I have been to Bento handful times. Its a great fast food lunch dine in. Their noodle bowls are amazing. My favorite is SOY CHILI CHICKEN NOODLE BOWL
5/12/2016,5,"It was our first time and although the experience started off ruff, there was a group that had too much to drink and being loud. Our waitress Courtney saw my husband and I were getting a little annoyed and moved us to another table. We ordered my food came out wrong so I had to send it back. Courtney came over and was so sweet and apologetic about everything my food came right out and it was great. She checked on us the rest of the night she asked us to come back and give them another try and said she was truly sorry our first time was a little rock. We are definitely going back the food is great and Courtney was awesome."
2/12/2016,4,"This place is awesome especially at happy hour. The entrees are all really good, and the atmosphere is ultra casual. Simply tasty Asian food. And the prices aren't ridiculous for what you're getting. If you want fancy, stay clear. But if you like really good Asian food in a casual environment, Bento is worth a visit. :)"
5/20/2013,4,"I got the Bento box which was a good amount of food. I always get the Pad Thai, that is just my favorite, just the right amount of heat every time. I got an appetizer for checking in which I shared with the table. So with the app and the box I was happily full.They pack a lot of tables in a small place but it doesn't feel cramped. I went with three other people and could hear them just fine. I also like the location there are places to go after dinner and you don't have to move the car."
11/29/2015,5,"Bento is one of my all time favorites, the food is always great. The spicy cream chicken is hands down the best thing I have ever had. The sushi is always great. I never have a problem when eating here, the service is awesome. Overall a great place for quick service."
7/24/2011,3,Sushi = HEAVEN! This is always our go to spot when we are craving sushi (which is almost daily) the busy atmosphere sometimes makes it difficult to find a table if you have 3 or more in your party.  I would NOT recommend going during the lunch time hours because you have to serve yourself which is not fun at all.
2/1/2016,5,"Had the katsu spicy curried chicken and noodle bowl.  Perfect portion and flavor for lunch.  Service was quick and accurate.   If you like something with a little bite, this hits the spot."
6/8/2009,3,"We grabbed a quick bite at Bento before heading upstairs for a movie at the new Plaza Cinema.  Service was adequate - attentive, but not intrusive.  Food was okay.  My sushi was good - and I got a great deal with the sushi combo box - you pick two rolls (4 pieces each) + 4 California rolls = 12 pieces for $8.25.  My sushi was fine - tasty and fresh, but, not remarkable.  My husband didn't care for his garlic tofu - they use silken tofu, which can be, uh, slimy in texture, and he thought his dish was rather bland.  We were both thrown off by the decor, however.  At a glance it looks very upscale.  But, disposable plastic cups for water, and plastic ""china"" didn't seem to fit.  My husband's rice bowl did come in a china bowl.  Why not go all china?  Also, the giant windows hadn't been cleaned in a while, and the window ledges needed dusting.  Our glass table showed it's wear badly due to under-lighting, which cast a weird glow on our food.  Also, why not hide the service station with a curtain or something?I don't regret our visit, but, with all the other great Asian places in Orlando, we probably won't be back."
1/30/2016,5,Great service and really delicious food! Thank you Enrique for making our first time at Bento an enjoyable one. We will definitely becoming back for sure.
9/26/2013,5,"My favorite place to go for healthy sushi. For me, that means I order Neo Tokyo Kawaii (wrapped in lettuce and rice paper). Tuna, krab delite, avocado, drizzled with sweet chili sauce. Super yummy. I get my sushi fix without the rice carbs."
2/10/2017,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. We came in and waited for a table at 8:17pm. As time passed, we noticed that people who came in long after us were seated before us. We asked the hostess how long until we're seated and he first quoted 15 mins. We waited the 15 mins then asked again and he said 10-15 so all in all it was roughly 45 mins. Once we were seated our party ordered our food immediately after being seated because we didn't want to wait longer. We waited over 25 mins for our food and it was still not ready! We asked the waitress how much longer and she said it's coming out shortly but that became another 10 mins and still no food. At this point we asked to speak to a manager but was told there was no manager on duty... the gentlemen that we spoke to said they were waiting for the sushi bento box we ordered and that was the reason our food took so long... I could've learned how to make my own sushi with the time it took to wait for a table and wait for our food; just saying. The amount of time spent at this place was not worthy the wait. Ultimately we left before our food arrived. We should've stuck to our initial plan, which was dining at Wahlburger. This place is a typical franchised restaurant and should be avoided at all cost. This was my family's first and last time ever coming to this place. The staff here are not attentive to large parties as it seems this place is too small to host them in a timely manner."
9/8/2010,3,"Good things:-They validate your parking-The food is great.-The food is priced pretty fair.Bad things:-inconsistent service.I go here quite a lot, so I've seen different waitress/waiters and the service has always been inconsistent. What I mean is that they will forget something that I ask for (eel sauce) or take too long to fill up my drink. Some times, I wait a while to get my check. Other than that, this is my PREFERRED place to eat sushi. It's just far from my house."
2/3/2012,5,"This place is great. I have been to a few sushi places around Orlando, but this one is the greatest experience I've had. The ambience, the decor, and the waiting staff all make you feel welcome. It's a very modern-styled place. Unlike some sushi places the menus are way easier to understand.The food was magnificent, and the prices were reasonable. I can find cheaper sushi, sure, but I could find much more expensive sushi at a far less enjoyable place.Highly recommend it."
1/17/2016,5,"When we can't get to PF Chang's, we want good Chinese food and call for Bentos - which is also a lil quicker and cheaper."
4/7/2016,5,Getting a spicy tuna don or specialty sushi roll is the highlight of cuisine at the Solar Bears games in the Amway Center. The food is expertly crafted and always tastes amazing. Can't wait to see you back next season!
6/14/2009,3,"Bento Cafe offers a wide variety of Asian cuisine at reasonable price.  There were six of us in the party and the bill came out to be less than $60.  We tried different noodle soup bowls and bentos.  My favorite was the Japanese pork chop bento (Katsu).   Overall, the bentos are very satisfying.  Nothing to wow us, but a good place for reasonable priced meals."
6/1/2018,4,"The steak is amazing, would get the steak again... but the noodles on the other hand are WAY too spicy and I don't think I would get their noodles in a close future. I love Bento café but I do not love their spicy noodles."
7/29/2008,3,"I will be honest, I have not jumped on the train of people who enjoy eating sushi.  So I cannot offer my true opinion of the sushi offered at Bento.  I can report though that a host of my Orlando friends cannot get enough!  Located in the Solaire on Orange Ave. it's a great location for urban dwellers craving asian cuisine.The variety seems to be up to par along with healthy substitutions such as brown rice.  I can say that the rice or noodle bowls arrive at the table promptly and generally get eaten with the same speed.  Again, I personally cannot say I've tried these, but I have been told to try: the Red Dragon Roll, the Rainbow Roll, and the Flying Dragon Roll.  The price is right for the large amount served."
8/19/2015,4,Great atmosphere. The sushi is always on point and service is quick. All rolls are price well. We always get 3 rolls 3 side salad and an appetizer and spend about $40 -$45
12/16/2015,5,The food was really good. My favorite appetizer on their list was Crab cheese rangoon. Its like a perfect portion of cheese and the imitation crab meat.
5/31/2013,4,"What I like the most about this place is that it's open late and there are always a lot of people there.I've only had the sushi and apps here. I love getting the sushi with the mango in it or kiwi in it. As far as quality goes, the sushi is exactly what you want, not bad but not amazingly good. Overall if I could, I would give it a 3.5 rating. Since I go there so much I decided to bump it up to a 4 star!"
2/21/2016,3,Super overpriced for mediocre food. I honestly only come here when I'm at the Cobb theater downtown and forgot to eat before leaving the house. The only thing I really like here is their wontons.
11/25/2015,4,This place is great for sushi and noodle bowls. Would recommend it to anyone downtown and looking for a fast casual place for Asian/Sushi.
2/19/2018,3,"Not the most professional place, customer service is subpar, however the food is good for the price. Wouldn't come back a second time, but it's good for a quick bite."
9/30/2011,4,"Currently, I'm on a very low carb diet, and decided that sashimi was the best way to go when coming to a japanese place. I chose the Tuna Lovers Special. I've only eaten raw regular tuna, but the other 2 two choices that came with it definitely opened my palette! The white tuna, I believe is escolar, just melts in your mouth like butter!Also their spicy and garlic edamame is a great appetizer to start with."
6/16/2012,4,"A solid choice for sushi and bento boxes.  Located in a prime location downtown right off Orange Ave.  Prices are reasonable, noodle bowls are filling and the food is delicious.  Trendy interior decoration and friendly service."
7/30/2011,3,Oh Bento how you get it so wrong yet you are so good.The Service is always slow as molasses here. Sometimes it takes 1.5 hours just to have a 1 course meal. Drinks come whenever you hit the lottery numbers.The place is LOUD - there is no acoustic treatment at all.. so its like stuffing 100 ppl in your garage. You can barely hear a conversation from someone right across the table from you.But Bento has awesome specials and its a great deal. So I go back time and time again. Just make sure you have enough time to eat :)
2/21/2011,4,"I've had take out from here and I've dined in.  Both times, the sushi was fresh and delicious.  The best value on the menu is the 151 Roll.  It has an entire tempura fried lobster tail on top of it.  For $15.95, you can't beat it.  Red Lobster won't even serve you a lobster tail for that price.  The special Mexican roll also totally rocks.  We also had a Gucci roll, which was divine.  The spicy edamame are perfect; just spicy enough to satisfy, but not so spicy that it blows out your taste buds.  I've had better sushi elsewhere, but for the location and value, it's worth a trip."
11/8/2015,2,"Apparently the service I had here was minimal. Which I have never had before. I was asked it my water wanted refilled? Um it's empty right?  Obviously I want this refilled. Then. My boyfriend and I ordered 6 rolls separately. They all came out on the same tray, and I had to ask the food runner which roll was which. When I said something to the server, he seemed like he didn't care and non-shalantly asked if we wanted a refill of our waters (which had been empty for 10 minutes). I am extremely disappointed in our service. When I put my Tuna Udon bowl to the side, a server asked if that person had finished eating. (I'm sorry are you handicapped?? Obviously it was my bf and I only eating, no there was not a third person. And yes. I did push my plate to the side). I am EXTREMELY disapponted in Bento. We have been here frequently and recently and I hope things improve."
4/11/2009,1,"To be truly honest, giving Bento Cafe at least 1 star would be considered a fairly nice compliment to the sham of a restaurant it really is. I've tried a range of wonderfully decadent restaurants and this was FAR from it. At best, this place deserves a -3 star (if possible).I cannot come up with any logical reason as to why Bento Cafe currently has a rating of 4 stars. My conclusion would be that there are several one-sided reviews from management on here.We went to Bento Cafe on a Thursday night around 8:20PM. Me and my boyfriend had never tried Bento Cafe, so we thought we'd give it a try. Much later did i think that it was a fairly BAD IDEA. To begin with, our annoyingly, bubbly waitress greeted us and sat us at a grimy, sticky table. This usually happens when:A. They reuse the table washcloth over-and-over.B. They DON'T wash/rinse the table washcloth after cleaning a table.C. Both A & B.You see, cleanliness is not a factor for Bento Cafe.Nevertheless, we tried wiping up the grime with the napkins at our table. I briefly ordered a Thai tea, while my boyfriend ordered a Boba tea. Many seats were empty and there were a equivalent of 3 couples including us. A slow night we had thought. Perhaps we'd get our orders out faster and we'd get out quicker; away from that grimy table sticking to our elbows.In a couple of minutes, the waitress came out with our overwhelming distasteful, powdery teas. She told us she'd give us a FEW MINUTES to decide what we wanted for the main course. But it took her about 10 minutes for her to realize we were still waiting for her to take our orders.She FINALLY took our orders:A Shrimp Tempura Bento Box ($8.75) for me.A Volcano Roll ($8.95) for the boyfriend.What happens after this is unbelievable. We sat there and waited. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited. Waited some more until I told my BF to turn on the timer on his phone. I figured since we've been waiting for A WHILE, the food would be cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients. Right....? RIGHT? We had this conversation while we were waiting indefinitely.WRONG. The schmuck finally served us after waiting for 30 minutes.When the ""food"" came out (if you could even call it edible), it was COLD. Stale as if they had left it on the back counter for a few years, or something that was scraped up from behind the kitchen stove. The ""shrimp tempura"" was soft and soggy and the cold oily noodles didn't taste too good either (imagine licking dry wall....). The side beans were extremely oily and the rice was too dry. I couldn't bear myself to stomach the sad-looking piece of ""dessert"" they slapped on the side. I started feeling nauseous midway into the ""Shrimp Tempura"". I stared at the grease that was congealing before my eyes and immediately pushed the sad excuse of a bento box away.When the bill finally came, we were both immensely tired and exhausted with a loss of appetite. We literally wasted over an hour at this place, waiting for the garbage you pass off as quality bento boxes / sushi.NEVER, NEVER AGAIN.Bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere. Highly not recommended."
4/17/2015,4,One of my favorite Sushi restaurants.  My number one is their location in Dr Phillips.  I would give them 5 stars but making the customer pay extra for Sriracha is ridiculous when your other locations have bottles of it on the tables for free.  I don't like being nickle and dimed for condiments.  Other than that very good.
3/19/2015,3,"If you're really in the mood for Japanese food, and can't be bothered to walk a few blocks away from the Plaza, then Bento fits the bill. The cuisine won't win any awards, but it gets the job done. Service is OK, if a little lackluster on the busy weekends."
3/23/2016,5,"My boyfriend and I have come to this bento several times and have always gotten terrible service but since we love the food we still go back. Last night however our service was amazing! Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgable. I believe his name was Enrique, he was super polite and helpful it was the best experience we've had at bento!"
8/6/2015,2,"We use to eat here once a week minimum. But the last three times , the service has been just awful . The wait staff is in need of a total overhaul . They are just plain rude and bad at their jobs . No one seems to care or want to take care of any problems ie.... Order totally wrong food brought out one plate at a time over a 30 min period for a table of four . This was the third week In a row and it was just an awful experience. Sushi rolls falling apart , portions cut so thin , half of what a normal portion has always been. It really is upsetting to go to a place for years , and to see them decline at such a fast pace. Keep wishing it was just a bad night , but after this last meal we have just decided to find another  fav sushi place in Orlando :(FYI , trying to reach you , tammy@bento-group.comUnable to find a valid email address. You can reach me at lgraycst@hotmial.com ."
8/24/2014,5,"I like the fact that Bento is a small restaurant. And centered in my neighborhood of downtown Orlando it makes it easy and convenient. The food is really good. I like the different types of rolls, not the same ol same ol. The soups are great too. I have ordered it delivered at times and have not been disappointed by inconsistencies either."
9/4/2014,5,SERIOUSLY GOOD! I lived in Orlando for a couple years and fell in love with this place. Every time I go back I have to eat here. Ive been to one in Gainesville & the Dr phillips location(which I prefer because of the boba/bubble tea). I would love to see them open one down here in southwest Florida. Its known for the sushi but I highly recommend The Spicy Cream chicken. Its to die for. I literally crave it! Can't wait to go again
3/22/2015,4,"Found this place thanks to yelp. The reviews were convincing and i must say they were not exaggerated.  Nice ambiance, friendly staff,  food is made fresh and the presentation is amazing.  I had the the tofu pad thai for lunch... i have to say Compliments to the chief,  I've gone to many Japanese/thai restaurants before and for some they over cook the tofu,  but here... it was cooked to perfection, not too hard or too chewy... maybe it was my lucky day, but food enough to make me want to come back.  The prices aren't too bad either.  The Jade abs mango roll is awesome , so many selections to choose from something must hit your desired craving."
3/14/2015,1,Worst sushi I've ever had. Visiting from out of town. .really wanted sushi and found this place
12/17/2017,1,"I've been here once before and the service was great, this time only the lady who took my ordered was extremely nice and understand and the people who brought the food were rude and acted like I was just taking up there time like they had something better to do as I watched them sit there and talk and do nothing. Unimpressed."
7/12/2015,5,This is one of my favorite places to eat in Orlando. Great food! Service is not always the best but the food is good.
6/16/2010,4,"Looks like your typical ""trendy"" sushi joint, but the crowd & pricing doesn't reflect the space.I went for the sashimi platter for the main course. It was $22 for 27 generous pieces of sashimi, including salmon, tuna, tai, yellowtail, escolar, ikura, & a clam of some sort.  Pretty standard, but good, fresh quality.  They also have bubble tea so I gave that a try as well.They've got a huge selection of rolls, many of them cooked, so if you're  a sushi noob, or sushi-timid, you should feel safe here; I wouldn't call this place an ""authentic"" sushi restaurant.  Happy Hour:  Buy 2 rolls, get 1 free.  Something else too but can't remember what.  If you're a sushi-tsu, you won't be happy here.  If you're just in the mood for quality standard sushi or a bunch of rolls(they have ~45 rolls) then stop in."
8/27/2010,3,"Price, taste, service and atmosphere - All Good. I visit there weekly for lunch since I work downtown. Always fast and always, corteous and clean. The Bento Box or the Noodle Bowls are the way to go, a little bit of everything for a great price. Recommend the Udan Noodle Bowl and if you cant make it out they deliver through doorstopdelivery.com :)"
2/2/2017,4,"They must got some improvement over the years or it just this location?  Been to bento on sand lake years back and found it to be okay.  Not the place I will pick for sushi.  But tonight they seem to earned my approval.   Got to revisited the place thanks to my friends Mike today.  Ordered a chirashi which usually what I get when going to a sushi restaurant.  Different type of sashimi on top of sushi rice.  Lack of presentation and knife work compared to my favorite spot but it's half the price.  $11!!!!  Omg.  That's the best deal I found so far.   The sashimi is fresh.  Thankfully.  Sushi rice little on the low side.  The texture and tastes are a bit off. But I totally won't mind for the price.  Although not sure why I didnt get any wasabi with it or ginger.  I need to asked for that.  Which I found to be odds.  That's like the common things to be given for sashimi.   I will understand if it's a nigiri.  Traditionally, it should be paired with right amount of wasabi already inside and you just choose to dip with soy sauce.  Anyway, it's totally a great night.  Awesome food.  I love to visit again.  If I ever in the area and in mood for sushi. That's the place I will go !  Totally coming back on a good night. Grab some sake and sushi.  Sit back and enjoy my night.  Awesome.  If you down there for whatever reason.  Give it a shot.  Even if you never ate sushi before.  My friend Mike tried it and he totally love it now.   Good job buddy.   So yep.  Grab your date.  Go watch a movie. Eat some great sushi."
10/24/2010,4,"Sashimi bowl with rice for $10.  That should be all you need to know, but the menu is huge, and some of the other servings that came to my table were also well-endowed.  That includes the chicken noodle soup, which is on my list to try if the weather here ever drops below 55 (that's when we turn the heat on back up north).Someone else got some sort of lo-mein style udon noodle stirfry, which I'm also looking forward to burying my face in.The best part is that you can bop next door for frozen yogurt at Mochi when you are done.... and I came back for the udon stir-fry, and it was glorious.  The bad news?  No more bubble tea.  The good news?  Bubble tea is moving in next door at Mochi - yay!"
9/7/2015,4,I got a ton of sushi and the beef noodles with veggies to go for my boyfriend and I for the first time the other day and it was so so much food and really good!!! I went a little overboard and ordered too much but I was surprised with how fresh things were. I'll def be back!
3/18/2011,4,"Creamy Spicy Chicken Bento Box - Cheap and delicious!  Def the way to go.  The bowls have too much rice or noodles, so the bento box is a great mix.Nigiri - Salmon was super fresh and deliciousThey validate parking for 2 hrs! Otherwise be prepare to pay $10 to use the parking structure."
4/2/2012,3,"As I see some reviewers have already touched base on (one referring to it at the ""Olive Garden"" of sushi restaurants, which I consider accurate), I wouldn't necessarily label this an authentic sushi restaurant, though it faired pretty well in my eyes. During a recent mini-vacation to Orlando, I couldn't overcome my regularly consistent sushi urges and had to stop in and try some.As always, I was ready to EAT! And luckily for me, they have a by two rolls, get one roll free as a regular special (high five for that!). The rolls were large, being 8 pieces per roll. If your math is accurate, then yes, I had 24 pieces of sushi. With the special price, it only turned out to be around $14, a pretty nice steal if you ask me.I order the Yoshi Roll, the Spicy Roll, and the Birthday Roll. I didn't keep track of the ingredients but I believe they have an online menu for all you foodies who want thorough descriptions.All of it was very good, the ingredients were fresh, and I definitely left full, very satisfying.My main complaint, and the reason for three stars, was the service. The friends I was staying with in Orlando had warned me that the service was sub-par and that it would take forever to even be seated. They were right. It took nearly a half hour for someone to come over and ask if we had been helped yet. I normally don't complain too much about service but it was inexcusable, especially considering the place was pretty empty. There were only about two other tables out of the entire restaurant that were occupied.But, given the nice location, good food, and great prices, I'd reccomend it for the local Orlando residents to get a quick sushi fix."
6/16/2015,4,"This place has a unique tasty flare on its sushi. Some less traditional and really creative combinations. There is a lot to pick from. I'm not into cheese or smoked choices in sushi so that kind of cut down on some selections. However, there was still plenty to pick from. The place was roomy, clean and a good atmosphere to sit down for lunch. The rolls were really fresh. The traditional roll I had was smooth and the TNT was full of flavor. The food here was really good. The staff was also very friendly and attentive."
1/2/2012,4,"Even though I wouldn't call this place an authentic Sushi/Bento restaurant, it's a great place to get your Sushi fix. There's a key things about Bento's Cafe that makes it a keeper in my book. 1.It's college friendly with the pricing. You can be satisfied with your meal without worrying about the bill. 2. Hipster environment. No worrying about being too loud or causing weird distractions here. Be yourself, nobody is judging you! 3. Good food. My favorite rolls here are the Mexican Rolls and the Mt.Fuji roll. Like I said before, I wouldn't consider this place an authentic Japanese Sushi bar, but it's a good place to get your sushi crave fix! I always order the Watakame Seaweed salad with the Sushi combo platter. (4 pieces of your own choice of roll + 4 pieces of your own choice roll+ 4 cali pieces roll.) I put the seaweed salad on top of the sushi and gobble it up! (: It's so yummy!!! I've never ordered a bento box here because I had bad experiences with them in the past...(Er..cake in a bento box?) But that was back in 2009..so maybe they've upgraded. However, I'll stick with my Sushi Roll ways and be a happy fish eater."
1/10/2015,4,Great food. Busy on a Saturday night. Everything was fresh. Will definitely come back
4/14/2015,3,Cheap sushi. .decent quality. DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY...they always mess up my orders. Have to always call and get them to refund me or resend an item.
10/4/2008,4,"Bento is located in the Solaire, one of the many newly constructed high rise condos in downtown Orlando.  I was pretty impressed upon entering Bento Cafe, as it was a very clean, upscale environment, the kind that you don't find too often in Orlando (there is even a TV in the bathroom!).  They offer great happy hour prices and extensive sushi choices.  They also offer Bento boxes, which come with a variety of items of your choice at a great price.  The last time I went was around 5pm on a Wednesday and we were the only ones there.  It is usually busier on the weekends and later during the week.  For great sushi at a great price, head over to Bento cafe."
1/23/2015,3,"Met some friends here while on a trip back home for the holidays. Its in the heart of downtown orlando. Great location if you work or live downtown.   I had the chicken bento box.. chicken, salad and noodles were all good and made for a satisfying lunch.  the downside was parking.. i parked in the lot upstairs and got validated but showed up a few minutes after the validation period and ended up paying $10 to park. i live in LA and never pay that much to park for lunch."
2/19/2015,5,"Awesome service, good food. Location is close to the Amway center. Who knew Japanese food in Florida could come close to Hawaii standards."
8/1/2015,5,"Absolutely great food, very affordable prices and Leanna is a fantastic server. A few reasons why I frequent here so often"
5/11/2009,3,"Drive by and decided to drop in since we were starved from the ride up. I had a bulgogi beef bowl with noddles. I dug it, we also tried the spicy dumplings, edemame, and fried dumplings. All were up to par. A great place for quick fast Asian food. I will try and swing by on my way out of town."
10/26/2015,5,My wife and I love this place. We got the bento boxes and it was delicious. The staff are awesome and the food came out quickly. I highly  recommend the Plum tea. It's a sweeter tea and is really good. The prices there are very reasonable. It was right around $20 for my wife and I.
9/14/2010,5,"Bento is a place that is very simple, don't expect exceptional service as if you were at a nice restaurant. The sushi is absolutely delicious, specially at this location.Everytime I am in Orlando I stop by here, its one of the best sushi I have tried. Fresh, yummy, and amazing!!"
3/23/2011,2,"I wish I could add another 1/2 a star, because it's better than 2 stars, but not quite 3.  First strike, the Dr. Phillips location stopped honoring restaurant.com gift certificates.  I had 3 waiting to be used and I'm pissed about it.  Sushi is good, not anything special, but it is fresh and good.  I enjoy the bento boxes.  I also enjoy the seared tuna salad they serve.  Hot and sour soup is exactly what you expect - all the right flavors, but nothing memorable.  Appetizers need a little creativity and brightness to them. I go back because it's consistent and convenient.  Not because I'm drawn back time and again.  GET RID OF THE GOLD PEAK ICED TEA.... BREWING TEA IS NOT DIFFICULT.  Add tea leaves to a filter and push a button."
6/23/2012,4,I went at a time when it wasn't so busy. Went with a friend and got the spicy cream chicken which I usually always get.     I really like how the interior of this bentos compared to the one in Gainesville and would recommend anyone to try it out. Definitely either try the spicy cream chicken or the katsu curry chicken. I also like to get the surf'n turf.
10/27/2012,3,"The place is cool. Nothing special. Service is pretty good and the food is decent. The downtown location is definitely much better than the one on Sandlake, servers are much more attentive and it doesn't feel like you are being rushed. Awesome boba teas, so that's definitely a win. Would certainly return!"
9/22/2015,4,Had the sriracha garlic chicken and lychee sake. Delicious!!!! Our service was not the best but the food is worth it
11/14/2014,3,"With the convenient location in downtown Orlando, I visited this restaurant for lunch on Thursday while I was waiting for my friend.  Even during the lunch time, the restaurant was not too crowded and my food was served in timely manner.  However, I was disappointed with the amount of food compared to other bento cafes throughout FL. I ordered spicy tuna rice bowl with extra tuna and avocado. It looked like they gave regular bowl and really not much avocado. The bento cafe on sand lake gives a lot more meat than this one. So I was pretty disappointed with its small portion although I paid extra $2.50 for extra meat. :("
4/9/2015,5,Crab Rangoon as appetizer and spicy cream chicken bento box will not disappoint. If you like sweet and spicy those are the choices for you. And food comes out pretty fast too. Love coming here when we get a chance to get away from the little one and watch a movie at nearby Cobb theatre.
2/7/2015,5,Amazing Pan Asian food. Lots of selections and the service is great. Grsar for those that want to quickly grab something to eat but in the mood for Asian. I don't eat Sushi but my friends keep praising their Sushi.
5/16/2015,3,"Great for a quick bite of Asian cuisine, without a polystyrene box or high end chopsticks. Price is a little high for what it is and service is okay. A good place for a quick, yet Asian diner feel while you're downtown before your movie."
10/19/2015,3,"I always come here for sushi, I've never really had anything else on their menu. They have a sushi box that comes with a California roll, two rolls of your choice, seaweed salad, and cucumber. I work nearby so I'll stop here for lunch and always do the sushi box. I always get my food quickly and the staff is nice. Haven't had a problem with them"
10/6/2014,5,"Greatest sushi around! From the rolls to the rice bowls, and everything in between, Bento always offers the best. My favorite sushi rolls are the Mt Fiji and the Mexican. My mouth waters just thinking about it! Easy to give these guys 5 stars! Sandlake location even has boba tea! Check in for a free appetizer :)"
6/24/2014,2,"They couldn't manage to get my order right.  Fried rice was made wrong and sushi was never entered into their ordering system.  All in all, this place makes money because of its location. Not because the food or service is great."
12/18/2016,1,"Horrible. Worst service ever. So as soon as I walked in the air conditioning wasn't working so it was humid as hell in there. The server (I can't remember her name) forgets to put my appetizer in. (It wasn't even busy). Then I ask her for albacore but she doesn't know what that is. I advise her it's a fish. I would assume it's a sushi place she should know what it is. She says we don't have that. So I out in my roll order. Very simple order, a roll in the menu just substituted the tuna did spicy tuna. She said I have to charge you and extra dollar. I say ok. Simple right? Nope. She brings it out with a slice of tuna in it. I open it for her and show her that the Order is wrong. She agrees and takes it back. Only to bring it back out to me and tell me the guy said it has both. I shake my head and say, please look at this. I open several pieces and show her, where do you see spicy tuna, there's nothing but a cut slice of tuna in every piece. I show her and she rolls her eye and walked away behind the counter, sets it down and tell the sushi guy something and then walks to the back? First of all bad service, and now an attitude. Great. Next thing you know the manager comes out and I explain what happened only to look behind him and see the 2 sushi guys staring straight at me like I'm the one who fucked up the order. Own your mistake. Make it right. That's all we ask. Needless to say I asked the manager to forget my order and cash me out for my soda. The manager apologized for the mistake and said he would take care of it. Very disappointed. But that server needs to seem real training on listening and quality customer service. Will never be back."
7/20/2015,5,"Having lived in Orlando for five years I am mildly obsessed with Bento. The sushi is always fresh and the rolls are imaginative with great flavor combinations. My favorites: TNT, Mt. Fuji, Caliente, and Special Mexican. The TNT and Caliente have the perfect amount of spice and the sweetness of the Mt. Fuji is a great counterbalance. Over the years I have brought numerous people here that have lived in NYC, San Francisco and Los Angeles and they have all been impressed with the sushi. The atmosphere of the downtown restaurant is nice. It's a great place to hit up before a night out. You also can't beat half price bottles of wine on Tuesdays and their buy 2-get 1 roll at happy hour. For me, the saddest part of no longer living in Orlando is not being able to get Bento!!"
4/21/2015,5,Raul makes the best spicy tuna don bowl in the whole joint. Love having you guys here at the Amway Center.
9/17/2015,3,"Today got bento box and noodles dry and terrible waiter not helpful or clued in when customer says ""dry, heat lamp"" it means get fresh ones... Their soup is good, but this was very disappointing - worse than mall food quality :("
10/29/2013,3,"Went here with friends, had been here once or twice before. Our first choice was Ceviche (closed Monday) or Ichiban (which changed names and is now no longer - sad). My experience here is it's quick service and typically busy- in and out like a cafe. I had the sushi box deal where you get the Cali roll and two others of your choice. The special Mexican roll was yum- served in a Bento box w/ a cucumber salad (didn't love) and string beans (cold) with sesame (did like this) also had ginger salad on side cause I'm a freak for that dressing. My friends all had bentos- two with chicken variations and one with Don Salmon. We all agreed its a good value dining there. Beer selection? Typical of an Asian/ Thai restaurant ( nothing craft or micro ). Bathrooms were gross and as we were sitting at table I noticed food stains on the wall. Service was attentive and suggested when asked. Overall, for a quick bite try this place- looking to impress? I'd move on."
1/23/2015,2,"This is different from those in Gainesville. In Gainesville, they take the order from the cash register and they deliver the order to the seat and they don't take a tip. Here it is like a regular restaurant.  Last night I ordered Chirashi bur the waitress didn't bring the small dish for the soy sauce. Wasabi didn't come with Chirashi. They don't know what to do. I ordered the extra meat for $2.50 but they added only 1 piece of grilled eel."
6/21/2015,1,Horrible service. For last 3 times I have been here service was worse than before. Dining room is empty and hostess is mia. After being seated table is filthy dirty and Sri my. I asked to be. Leaned.  It never happened. I had to change tables on my own. I asked for my order to have side of siracha and specifically mentioned to waitress to make sure I et nude side since I never got the last few times I visited. And of course they still did not bring and I had to ask several times to make it happen. Will never be back here or recommend to anyone.
8/20/2015,5,There spicy creamy chicken is to die for. I have it at least 3 or 4 times a month snd there all you can eat sushi special is bomb.
5/2/2014,4,Yummy sushi and great service. We love sitting at the bar because the sushi chefs are so nice.
2/25/2017,3,"We UberEATS to go.  I had the TNT roll sadly,  if you can slice the Tuna any thinner it would vanish.  Quite possibly they were running out?  The miso was a hit as well as the Tuna salad. Not sure I would order the roll again, being a sushi snob."
12/13/2014,4,"Good quality at a very fair price.  This is a go-to for lunch downtown.  The bento boxes are great, the portions on the dons are a little small but very tasty."
8/7/2014,5,A quality asian meal at an affordable price of about 8 dollars an entree. There are many choices of flavors to choose from so you're bound to find something to suit your taste.
6/17/2014,5,"This is my favorite sushi spot in Orlando - the prices are great, the food is consistently good, both sushi and bento boxes, the staff is always friendly and despite it being downtown, I've never had to wait too long to be seated.  Definitely worth a trip if you're downtown Orlando and craving some sushi."
8/4/2014,3,"I came here about two weeks ago. I was in the downtown area and was looking for something eat. I went on my yelp app on y phone and saw this place was very close to where I was. It was actually in the area I parked. However, I could not find Bento at first. I walked by it a couple times before I realized. I was pleasantly surprised to see it was a fast casual type of place. You order your food at the counter, and then they bring the food to your table. I ordered the sushi combo box lunch special with included two rolls of your chorice, and a california roll for $9.25. It seems like a good deal, but each roll is only four pieces. I'm used to rolls being  , on average, 6 pieces each. So, I thought that was a little odd. I ordered the jalapeno and the spicy tuna rolls to accompany the california roll. All the rolls were okay, but nothing above average. The jalapeno roll did have a pretty nice kick to it. Overall I had a good experience and would recommend."
8/23/2014,4,"The food here is great for the price. It's not cheap, but it's high quality and you get a lot. Most of their dishes are excellent. Their sushi is good and also more reasonably priced than other sushi places around the Orlando area. I highly recommend Bento to anyone craving asian cuisine."
2/1/2015,5,I haven't tried anything here I didn't like! The Special Mexican roll and Mongolian Chicken Noodle Bowl are by far my favorites!
4/22/2017,3,"The food is ok, but used to be better here. The service is getting a lot worse.  Servers are not trained well. Miso soup was served almost cold, no small dishes for soy sauce, servers ask question how food is and walk away before we can answer. The sushi is ok, but the service has gotten too frustrating."
5/31/2013,4,"My girlfriend and I go here at least once a month. It's a great place to meet friends before going out to bars and clubs downtown.Honestly, for us, it's more about the atmosphere and location than the food. While some of their dishes are higher in quality, other dishes just don't measure up. The fish is always fresh and tasty, while the rice is consistently sticky, and the portions of rice are rather large.Anything sashimi on the menu is very good. If you do prefer a good amount of rice, their ""Tuna-Don"" bowls are especially good. Make sure you get their spicy Japanese Mayo too!!! Very good!We will continue to go to Bento Cafe simply on the principle of atmosphere and location. There are better Sushi establishments in Orlando, and even in Downtown. If you're looking for a great place for a party, or large group, Bento is the place. The food is just good enough. Oh, I forgot to mention the prices are very fair for the location.Stop by Bento is you're ever in Downtown and want some quality Sushi at a good price and fairly quick."
5/5/2017,2,"I visited Bento for the first time in about 6 months last night, and was very disappointed. It has gone from full service dining to basically fast food restaurant-like service. No one acknowledges you when you walk in the door, which was confusing because I was used to being seated by a host and having a server come to the table. Now, you order from the front counter, take a number, and choose your own table. No one comes to check on you, they only bring you your food. I'm not quite certain what I'm expected to tip on if there's no actual service. I would normally have a few drinks with my dinner, but now that means that I have to get up, grab my own beer from a cooler, and wait in line with people ordering food in order to get another drink. I'm not sure if they're trying to cut costs and have less staff, but if they keep the same setup, I would rather go to Pei Wei for the same level of service for half the price."
2/24/2017,1,Called to see what the hours were and the girl hung up on me after she made a smart ass answer.
2/22/2015,4,I had the cucumber avocado roll and it was phenomenal. Would absolutely go back a second time and would recommend to stop by if in downtown orlando.
2/6/2015,5,I cant say enough nice things about this place. I really love the menu and atmosphere. It can be a bit overcrowded sometimes. But I have never had an issue with service.
7/1/2016,2,"Came here for something I could eat after a wisdom teeth surgery, not the best place for that. Ordered curry, hoping it would my typical soup constancy when I order from my Thai restaurant but it was just a bunch of veggies with a little bit of sauce. I explained to the employee as I was ordering I would need something soupy since I can't chew solids yet, when the food came I asked for more sauce, and he told me it would be extra. Long story short, I gave my leftovers to the homeless since there was no way I could eat it."
8/24/2014,5,"Second time eating here. The sushi is absolutely wild, most notably the Volcano Roll & the Dragon Roll. Prices are reasonable but I'm dying to make it back there for the all you can eat sushi on Saturday afternoons!"
6/30/2014,5,Been here a few times and the food is always good. Their tuna is always fresh and their service is generally fast. Can get busy around lunch but you an order ahead online and it'll be ready when you get there!
5/14/2014,2,"This is one of many places downtown Orlando that states that they are open until 10:30PM, but not only close at 10:00PM but do not deliver.  It's really frustrating to a business traveler that relies on an accurate Yelp profile to do menu orders.  Their answer is that ""a third party delivers"" and that company, Doorstep delivery, does not accept late night orders."
3/27/2017,1,"If you call in for takeout, they'll put you on hold and never pick up the phone again. I've had this happen to me too many times for it to be an accident."
9/25/2013,5,FAVORITE!  Love this place!  We even had our Rehearsal Dinner here!  Spicy Cream Chicken is the BEST!
8/11/2014,5,Awesome place to eat before or after catching a movie at The Plaza. We've been here several times and it never disappoints. Food is great and prices are affordable.
7/27/2014,3,"Having been used to eating in the original bento cafe in Gainesville, I found this establishment lackluster. They make you sit down and wait for the waiter, basically to demand a tip. The bento cafés in Gainesville, fl just let you order food and take it to a table. It took twice as long to get our food when we were starving. If you ever drive by north Florida, be sure to stop by the original in Gainesville."
10/11/2013,4,"One of my favorite places to eat. Their prices are reasonable and the food is very fresh. During the lunch hour, you seat yourself after placing an order but at night, they change the atmosphere into seated/waited on restaurant. I love the environment here.My favorite lunch special is the bento box. Love the amount of rolls and the fact that you can choose what you want. You can substitute the standard california roll with one of their specialty or executive rolls for a dollar more. Be weary though they charge you an extra dollar for rolls with salmon or tuna on them. Not only that, if you get the california roll with the tuna on it, they change you the extra dollar for the change in roll and the extra dollar for the meat instead of just an extra dollar for just the tuna addition to the standard california roll in the  lunch special bento box.The miso soup is perfect! There is a perfect balance of flavor. I could use more tofu but other than that, delicious!I rated it 4 stars because sometimes, the waiters and waitresses get the orders wrong. I have had to send bento boxes back because the wrong bento box was grabbed and given to another customer. It happens particularly with one waitress so I try to check my order before she leaves. Minor issues compared to issues other Asian Fusion restaurants have."
3/1/2015,5,"Recently, the Amway Center has contracted Bento sushi to cater all of their events. Everything from Orlando Magic Basketball games, Solar bears Hockey games, concerts, and everything else inbetween, you will always find the bento booth right by section 108 on the second floor. Once you get there you'll meet Raul and Christina. Christina is always happy to ring you up and Raul will make you some of the best rolls, and bowls(dons) that you have ever had. Every Solar bears game I attend as a season ticket holder I go up and order the chefs special from Raul and I have yet to dislike anything he has made me. They are so incredibly friendly, well kept stations, and delicious food. Keep doing what you're doing Raul!"
9/7/2009,4,"Bento has become one of my favorite downtown stops.  The food is good.  I highly reccomend the bento boxes as they come with a ton of food.  The ricebowls are also more than enough to fill someone up.  I personally don't like sushi, but I hear it is also very good from diners I have eaten with. Overall,  I love the clean, modern urban decor of the restaurant.  It has a trendy look and feel without the price you would generally associate with that look.  The live DJ entertainment on weekend nights is also a huge plus.  The only factor that kept me from rating five stars is that service can be slow during peak times.  During the day, counter service from the bar is available, and service is generally not an issue."
2/9/2014,4,"We really like going here.  It's good sushi and other Asian style food (Thai, etc.) at a great price.  My husband prefers sushi and I prefer Thai, so it's nice to go somewhere that does both well.  The bento boxes are huge and only about $8 at dinner and the sushi costs about the same--great deal!  The only downside is that the service is often hit or miss."
9/15/2018,2,"I've been to Bento since it first opened and it's always been a great sushi place that served a good meal if you were in the area. This afternoon my boyfriend and I went to Bento and I was shocked when the whole place has been turned into Asian fast food with no more table service. You order at the counter and get a number , find yourself a table , go get your own drink from the soda fountain in a plastic cup, get utensils out of a bin and wait on your food. My boyfriend who ordered a bowl of some kind with noodles got his first and I waited well over 15 min for my sushi box combo which was $10( California roll 8 pieces , spicy tuna 4 pieces , and the caliente roll 4 pieces) . My boyfriend was halfway thru his meal by then. I have no idea why it would take that long as there seemed to be several employees and maybe four other customers who had already received their  meal.   The rolls were fine and I'm glad I didn't get more than that because the whole experience was a disappointment  ! I have typically spent  $30-40 on meals there and totally worth it for creative rolls that are fresh but there is no way I would spend that on this place anymore. The ten dollar box was totally worth it and would probably only go there if I was in the area and wanted basic sushi for cheap to go.  There are so many better options in the downtown area for quality Japanese food and a way better experience."
6/29/2014,4,"The steamed dumplings and the Florida roll have kept me coming back to Bentos since my Gainesville days. While it's not as inventive as some local sushi places, the combinations are fresh and the amount of fried rolls limited. The prices are reasonable and I have yet to be disappointed with the quality of their fish. And, the udon soup nurses a mean hangover."
12/21/2013,2,"I've been here a couple times and don't plan on going back again. This place can get really busy so you could wait a long time and then be upset when you eat the food. For one thing, they don't have real crab. I asked. It's all imitation crab. Which is not crab. It's like white fish with dye. Dont call it crab when it's not crab. Anyways... It's also a little pricey for sushi. It's just average quality food for more money. I've gotten a couple different rolls (none of which included krab) and they were alright. I would suggest Fuji Sushi for really good sushi. My boyfriend got teriyaki chicken and it was just 'okay'."
5/24/2016,3,"The food was OK. It wasn't incredible but I would say it was good. The sake wasn't as warm as it should be and the service was actually on the poor side. Our waitress walked away as my husband was ordering to take care of something else, he had to holler back at her to come back so he could finish his order. When she came back he orders his food, his two drinks and he likes spicy mayo with his sushi. Never ever brought him his soda a single time. The food took over an hour which I don't blame her for. It's really out of the waitress' control how long the food takes. When we let her know that the food was taking long she was apologetic about the kitchen being backed up and having issues or whatever which I totally understand and all but I am really good at body language so I wasn't at all convinced, she actually looked like she was being dishonest but whatever so the food came like 5 minutes later. My husband again asks for spicy mayo and it never came just like the soda. Then the bill comes in and we were automatically charged tip 18% which he crossed off and wrote the amount sans tip. I understand they work off tip but it still needs to be earned, it's not given just because or out of sympathy and we really don't feel like she did a good job. The tip was still charged anyway, pretty ballsy of you to charge something we spcified NOT to."
8/25/2013,5,"One thing about Bento is that its always the same with them every time. I always get a substantial amount of quality food for the money. Their Soy Chili is my favorite, but the Pad Thai is a close second. The TNT and Envy sushi rolls are also awesome. The Red Curry dishes are also pretty memorable, with the curry being the right amount of coconut milk and heat. The Edamame is also a mix of salty and sweet that I can't get enough of. I always go for happy hour when its not crazy busy."
7/27/2018,3,"We really enjoy the food here, but every time they get busy, they simply shut off Uber Eats. I operate restaurants for a living and I just simply cannot wrap my head around the idea of that they would choose to refuse third party delivery orders as opposed to finding a way to keep up with Guests' orders. I would assume the owner isn't aware that they're doing this... if it was my restaurant I'd be looking for a new BOH manager and/or expediter. Find a way to work more efficiently, leave your restaurant online and available for your loyal Guests and watch your sales climb... I'm really not one to complain, but this has happened 8 of the last 12 times we have ordered (varying days/nights of the week) over roughly a 3-month period. Also, each time this happens (sometimes in the middle of placing an order) I call and am told ""Yeah, we're experiencing high volume so we turned it off for the rest of the night"". Gotta go! Jumping back on UE to order dinner for four hungry Millennials!"
5/8/2013,3,"This place was a bit of a let down. Decided to walk in for lunch. When I walked in, I decided to take a look at the menu since I've never been in. There was a man at the counter taking a phone order, but it was a bit lengthy and there were not other waiters available to take my order. After about 3 minutes, I was finally helped by the man at the counter. I ordered a rainbow roll, dragon roll, and seaweed salad.I headed over to my table and waited for my food. my seaweed salad came out first and it was pretty standard. It tasted like the seaweed salad you'd get at an AYCE place. Shortly after, my rolls were delivered. I was very disappointed at the size of the rolls. They were very small. The dragon rolls was way too loaded with eel sauce, which made it a bit too sweet and overwhelming for the size of roll that I had. The fish on the rainbow roll wasn't very fresh and felt a bit stale.I really don't know if I'll be back. It was a bit of a let down but I was desperate for some quick sushi."
1/14/2011,4,"I love this place. I have tried various dishes here, and the majority of them are really good. The service is standard, nothing that really stands out. If you go here you must do the 151, TNT, and Sweetheart Rolls. They are the best! As far as Bento Boxes, I haven't had one yet (I know it kind of defeats the name's purpose), but I have had several rice bowls, and they're fantastic.My favorite is the Spicy Creamy Shrimp and Chicken Rice Bowl, Pad Thai Rice Bowl, and Beef Teriyaki Bowl. I would definitely stay away from the Seafood bowl and the Red Bean Ice Cream."
7/2/2013,3,"This hip spot in downtown Orlando deserves some attention.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive while the decor is modern and simple.  We ordered a chirashi bowl and the Japanese curry.  Both were slightly disappointing, but the presentation was very nice.  I would recommend this for beginners in the sushi world."
1/11/2014,5,My favorite go to place in Orlando! I love the sushi and food options so much I come here weekly. The staff knows us and they are all awesome as well! My favorite roll is their TNT it's a perfect combination of Spicy Tuna!
4/14/2016,1,"If McDonalds were to open a McAsian food these guys would need to worry, I made the mistake of ordering the bento hibachi steak thinking it's probably the best thing considering its steak, I was wrong. The steak was cold, chewy and resembled steak only in the fact it was beef of some manner. Would not recommend or return."
12/7/2014,3,"This is a nice place. For some reason, I thought I have posted about them in the past. I like that it is fast and the place is clean. The only small drawback is that there isn't much of a view. The place is kind of tucked away in a corner."
4/1/2014,3,"Richard Pro here with another review.Bento cafe is decent but certainly not upscale. The menus are old and sticky. The interior is a little bit too dark. Service was good.Ordered a bento box and some sushi. Had I just ordered bento, this would easily be a one star review. The rice came in small portions and was boring. The chow mein was some of the worst chow mein I've ever had. My pork katsu was crunchy and flavorless. The sauce that came with it was incredibly sweet.The sushi made up for the terrible bento box. Fresh, vibrant, and a nice blast of fresh flavor. 3 stars. Go for the sushi."
3/17/2014,4,"This place is great. The food is consistently delicious, fresh and affordable. The service isn't stellar, but it's not bad either. The restaurant is always busy at night so keep that in mind..they don't rush you but you are expected to eat and leave if there is a wait."
11/14/2015,5,"Love this place! Great atmosphere, service, and the food is yummy. Always a great go to!"
7/2/2010,2,"Asian fusion restaurants have sprouted everywhere in the past few years much to my dismay!  While the decor is often modern, sleek and trendy, the food often isn't up to par.  Bento Cafe is one such trendy asian fusion joint.It's situated in a great located in the heart of downtown Orlando smack dab next to the new movie theatre in The Plaza on Orange Ave.  During lunch, customers order at the counter and seat yourself.  Waitstaff starts at 5pm.  They do offer parking validation for orders over $10. The menu is curious but the flavors are not.  There's an extensive array of sushi and customers can choose one of many Asian dishes either as a bento box (rice, noodles, side salad and the main dish) a noodle bowl or a rice bowl.  I've tried the garlic sauce, Kung Pao and Szechuan sauces.  All of them were watery and relied too much on soy sauce for flavoring.  None of the dishes offer an array of vegetables.  Most dishes only offer one-three vegetables.  My dish came with bamboo shoots, sugar snap peas and carrots.  I wanted broccoli in place of the bamboo shoots and sugar snap peas and had to pay a $1 substitution fee.  Not bad but not great when other more authentic places in town kindly offer substitutions and/or additions.  My dish was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all.  The tofu was firm and friend well.  My favorite thing about bento besides the location was that they offer soda water at the fountain--not a good sign for an Asian restaurant.Overall, if I want to spend $20 on Asian food, next time I'll go to Thai House or Sea Thai!  Bento was a flavorless disappointment with chic ambiance and a great location."
7/3/2009,4,"You can't go wrong with the Tuna/Salmon Don rice bowls.  A generous portion of raw fish on top of sushi rice topped off with avocado, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, and spicy mayo with caviar make up this great dish!  The sushi is average and is a bit pricey for what you get.  The cooked entree's are delicious which you can get with either rice, noodles, or as a bento box.  Bento Cafe is a quick service restaurant during lunch and morphs into a full service restaurant at night.  The ambiance is cool and hip and the service is friendly.  Would recommend to anyone that loves quick Asian food!"
5/11/2016,4,"Good environment, good food, and good service. Nothing let me down but nothing blew me away either. A solid 4 stars."
5/10/2013,3,"This was an unplanned quick meal but it was surprisingly good. We had 30 minutes before going to the movies upstairs and wanted to grab a quick small bite before stuffing our faces with popcorn. Anyway, we are very picky with sushi places as we are very spoiled in the sushi category (with our favorite restaurant being a sushi place and all). Our friends wanted to try it and it was convenient at the time.The other 3 people in my table ordered a different roll each and they were very pleased. I ordered a sashimi bowl of half spicy tuna and half salmon and this was served on a bed of rice with masago, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds and a tiny bit of seaweed salad. I was very happy with it and the fish tasted fresh which is the most important part for me. I thought it was going to be a small dish but it was nicely sized for $8. Service was pleasant and quick. Would try it again if I'm in the area. I saw some nice-looking bowls filled with steak/chicken, rice, etc. that I want to try next time."
11/9/2015,5,"Came here before a movie and was taken back by the amazing food! Our server Wanda was very knowledgable about the Saki options and helped us choose an phenomenal peach Saki. Food, atmosphere and employees were all above and beyond. Definitely coming back."
4/9/2011,4,"i like Bentos has a great atmosphere with a very friendly staff the dinning are is very clean and the staff is a little shy but very friendly. i enjoy they why the are is designed gives a very fun thermthe food is sub par and this is its only down fall the sushi i had was like every body else, although i try to order something that no other sushi place has ever time i go to a new place. i could not find a dish. would i ever go back yes the staff is nice and the dinning area is clean i would recommend this place to a person that is looking for a place to eat close by other then that its a 4 star at best"
6/21/2011,4,I love Bento! Great location. I love the Bento boxes or their sushi lunch specials. My new favorite thing that they have is the spicy tuna salad. All of the flavor of a few rolls with none of the carbs! Then I always ruin it by eating their veggie spring rolls which are perfct! My mom makes home made spring rolls all the time and I ALMOST think that Bento's rolls are better. Great place to visit when you are downtown.
4/25/2010,5,"Bento has become a regular on our feeding schedule.  The sushi is very fresh.  We really like the Hot Lava roll.  Also, try the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl.  It has the a delicious sauce with a little spice to it.  Highly recommended.  For the price, you also get a lot of food."
9/8/2011,4,"I remember my first time walking in and taking my time looking at the menu to ensure to pick just the right item. It is a place I frequent due to the location and yumminess! I skimmed through some other reviews before posting mine and yes at times the service might be slow, but during off hours its quiet and empty, but regardless of the crowds of people or sitting alone at this establishment, I have never walked away feeling I don't want to go again. Rather I think when will I come again.Another plus is regardless of what you like, you can find something there to enjoy. Some might describe it as a sushi place, but even if you aren't a sushi eater there is plenty of variety to try. Talking about it now, I now want some bento!!! So hope you go and enjoy just as much as I do!"
3/2/2016,4,I had a Bento Box with Shrimp and Broccoli and it was really good. Good price as well!
6/27/2012,4,"Bento Cafe is good for what it is. It is cheap sushi (8.95 for the 12 piece combo box--4 pieces each of two rolls of your choosing then 4 pieces of California roll, $9.95 for Chirashi)  and the two experiences I've had have been good. Service was fine both times, the atmosphere is nice, and we were able to order for lunch and take out for dinner for the same price as we normally pay for one sushi meal.The Chirashi was a nice portion for a one person meal, especially with the free appetizer that comes with a Yelp check-in. It is also the cheapest I've found in town and the fish was fresh enough to make it worth it. I actually like the mackerel, which was surprising since it's not a fish I'm normally impressed by. With my free appetizer I got the Fried Cheese Wontons that reminded me of the same dish from Pei Wei with the slightly spicy dipping sauce that came with it. Nice and crispy, easy to pull apart and actually see the Krab inside. With the sushi combo box we ordered the Florida roll and the Special Mexican roll, which ended up being so good we ordered a second for dinner. The Florida roll was just a small amount of cream cheese with the fish which carried the texture and flavor of the tuna and salmon wonderfully while the Special Mexican roll was nice and crispy with a great shrimp flavor that was complimented by the eel sauce, the spicy mayo, and the cream cheese. The rest of our order was okay, but nothing I would reorder. We got the Sweetheart roll, the Neo Tokyo Kawaii, and the Spicy Salmon Don. I wasn't a huge fan of their sweet chili sauce and the Neo Tokyo Kawaii was covered in it. The tuna was better in the Florida roll then the Neo Tokyo Kawaii, which was a bit mushy in texture for having cucumber and lettuce both in it; I would have preferred another Special Mexican roll over the Sweetheart in both flavor and price for something featuring shrimp tempura. The Salmon Don had a bit of a drab salmon flavor and the pieces were at times almost too tiny to grab with chop sticks. In closing, stick with the cheaper stuff on the menu because it tends to be better than expected and the less cheap stuff seems to not be Bento's forte."
3/13/2013,4,"I really did like this place. The items we got were very good. We were there for an event and we were served Fried Cheese Wonton, Sushi, and chicken that was fried I never got the name of it. They were like chicken nuggets with a sauce and they were so good. The servers came around and asked us if we wanted more and we were full. Very nice place. Very classy. All kinds of people come in here. Very busy the night we showed up. Seems they have several locations. Gotta check it out."
2/6/2011,4,Mmmm I shared a bento box and sushi box with a friend and we had tons of delicious food!  I think we had the Mexican roll and I would definitely recommend that one. Nice atmosphere and great food!
10/22/2008,4,"Bento Cafe is an exciting addition to the downtown Orlando sushi scene. Its kind of hard to find, look under the escalators in the new Orange St. complex that's home to Urban Flats and Corona Cigars. The decor is modern and exciting, really invoking thoughts of what a trendy downtown place to grab a bite should be. Cool art hangs from the ceiling attached to lights and sleek styled booths and tables fill the space. There is a raw bar, though not to actually sit at, and a few flat screen scattered about. But the real fun starts when the food arrives. Their creative roll choices and old favorites are scrumptious for dinner or a pre night out snack. Try the special mexican roll, its a popular choice and mouth wateringly good. And the sashimi bowls are tender and filling. But for those of you that regard eating raw fish as a punishment to your stomach don't fret. This little cafe is a Japanese fusion restaurant so you can find anything from fried shrimp, to noodle dishes, to spicy teriyaki chicken with rice on the menu. And of course they offer the bento box, thus the name. But don't forget the saki! Bento has many choices, my personal favorite being the lychee. Its a house specialty so a wine sized bottle of it is moderately priced at $20. The sparkling saki is also refreshing to the palate. Bento's food is cheap as far as this type of cuisine goes and though there are always some patrons inside chatting and munching its never a crowded atmosphere, snagging a table even for large parties is a breeze. If you're really looking for a steal head over between 4-7pm on weeknights. Happy hour brings about 2 for 1 rolls and drink specials. Bento's is a great little cafe offering pretty much anything you might expect in the way of Asian cuisine incuding some concoctions destined to become new favorites."
2/6/2016,5,My daughter is home sick so it was great to be able to have great food delivered to her. This is the restrauant she wanted delivery from she eats there often. She loves the Mexican Roll and Udon Noodle soup.
1/26/2012,5,"Gotta love Bento! Atmosphere, food and price is all great. I prefer their Bento box over their sushi rolls. My personal favorite is the Spicy Cream Chicken box.  Actually one night it was six of us and 4 of 6 ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken box - it's delicious! Also, I'll found the portion size of chicken to be more generous at this downtown location compared to the one on Sand Lake.  I highly recommend, you will definitely find something on the menu that you will like."
5/26/2010,5,"I have to try and go to Bento at least once a week, it's that good!  They have a wide range of menu items, from two different kinds of bowls, a bento box, and sushi.  The menu is reasonably priced and service is decent.  The only down side of the menu is that they don't have a full bar- just wine, beer, and sake.  This location is the ""blue"" bento and the decor is very trendy and cool.  At lunch its counter service and at night its a full service restaurant.  I recommend for any time a day! Also Bubble tea is awesome!"
8/20/2012,5,"Great food, friendly service and wonderful atmospere. It's definately great for families, date night or just a fun girls night out."
10/9/2013,5,"Fantastic service, the food is excellent, price is low, and the portions are more than generous."
4/8/2013,4,"We hit this place for lunch with a group and had a great time. They have a great menu with lots of choices. Speaking of, can you turn the lights up just a titch in there? I had to pull out my phone to read the flipping thing. I digress...the food was good. I had a bento box, of course. Very tasty. The worst/best part about this place is the location. It's right smack downtown but parking is not easy. The garage that backs up to the plaza has to be among the worst ever. It was made in another country, I'm sure. A country where cars are 8 feet long and 4 feet wide. Just awful. It's a little loud but that's to be expected downtown."
12/9/2011,3,"Busy, bustling and tasty, but the staff doesn't seem to be able to keep up at the downtown location.  Or maybe they just don't care?  I seemed to see a lot of standing around..."
12/14/2013,5,"I had the Spicy Creamy Chicken. It was one of best Asian restaurants even compared to my trips to San Fransisco,CA and NY. Highly suggest it!"
7/2/2015,4,Good value and quality sushi and sashimi. Consider ordering online as a single ordering counter may cause a line if they're busy.
6/28/2017,1,"My girlfriend and I showed up to this location on June 24th, 2017 at 10:03 pm, one hour PRIOR to closing. Apparently, a few hours prior to closing they make everyone order all their sushi and other dishes (to include drinks) right away before even being seated. You were forced to pay and submit a tip prior to getting any service which I was not a fan of. Regardless, we ordered and picked our booth. Upon sitting down we had a dirty table which took them a while to clean considering they were not busy (even on a Saturday). We were given our Sake really quickly which was nice but were never offered water or dining utensils. Once our food came out we realized we needed utensils (forks and chopsticks) and napkins. We were then given one plastic fork with a paper napkin and then one regular metal fork. They claim it was due to the fact that they haven't done dishes. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! Keep in mind, its only been 10 minutes and they still have 45 minutes until close. We ate our food with one each plastic fork and one each metal fork. We asked to speak to the manager to explain our lack of utensils and our lack of water and napkins. The manager comes up and just relays that he'll ""smack them on the hand"" then brought us our waters but still did nothing to compensate for the shitty service we had. Considering it was a Saturday night and they had over 9 free tables and it was an hour prior to closing, this service was unacceptable. I have been here many times (much closer to closing) and had great service. The service was an absolute travesty."
2/7/2011,4,"I really enjoy Bento. I go during lunch (just be prepared for a lunch rush and to seat yourself) and during dinner. Dinner is a little less high paced and you have table service. It's a mixture of sushi and regular Chinese dishes. Its like really good Chinese food without the possibility of MSG. I can't stand MSG. It's unhealthy and gives me a headache. Bento is fresh and flavorful. Bento is also in an area that holds a bar, movie theater, coffee shop, and fro yo. So you can have dinner, dessert and a movie in one stop. If you feel frisky the clubs/bars are all in walking distance."
7/24/2011,2,"We stopped at Bento Cafe for  quick snack before the movies yesterday.   There is something wrong with the set up in here.  The tables are too close together and it just has a claustrophobic feel.  They should probably work on their Feng Shui.   Also, the ""techno/ dance remix"" music was turned up so loud we could barely hear each other.  Our server was a little pushy and seamed eager to get us out the door as soon as possible. Most every aspect of this restaurant made me feel on edge.  My husband and I both ordered a ""Don"", which is basically a bowl of rice with raw fish, roe, avocado and seaweed salad on top.  It was pretty good and the price was right ($7.95).  We finished the meal with a bowl of red bean ice cream. Though Bento is not the best sushi in town, it is certainly not the worst either."
11/18/2015,4,"Yum, yum!  Average price, good menu.  Good taste.  Authentic."
8/20/2015,5,"Very good sushi. California rolls in other places are generally only ""okay"" but I was impressed with the taste of the California rolls here. They also have good specials when ordering multiple rolls."
3/4/2012,5,I love sushi.  I love pad thai.  I love working downtown so close to Bento that I can eat lunch there at least 2 times a week.  The Vegetarian Roll is fantastic as is their pad thai.  Love Love Love it!
4/2/2015,4,"This is a small place, located under the Plaza Cinema. I visited at 9:30pm on a Thursday, and it was super crowded and busy. I was flying solo, but still got friendly service here. My spicy tuna roll and volcano roll were good."
8/30/2011,4,"I like here and I go there quite often.Their food are cheap and very fair for the price and their service. I had Katsu(both bento Box and Rice ball), Bulgogi Box, Chirashi, and Sushi and so far I like them all. (If you are hungry make sure you'll ask a waiter/waitress how big it is. I thought Chirashi was a bit smaller than others... well sorry if I'm wrong.)   The manager here is VERY helpful and friendly too. I also like the fact that they are closed to the a movie theater."
10/20/2011,4,"The best thing about this place is that looks so high end but its very affordable. It's in the heart of downtown in The Plaza on Orange Avenue so parking is pretty difficult unless you park in the garage. A great date place without spending a lot of money. Almost everyone there looked like they were on a date. If you are alone, you can sit at the bar.I got a Spicy Cream Chicken bento bowl which came with chicken, peppers, broccoli, noodles, rice, ginger salad and a coconut white cake dessert. It was only 8 or 9 bucks but it was so filling and the best part was the spicy chicken. It wasnt too spicy at all as well as nice and moist. The broccoli was dried out but the noodles were great. The portion wasnt small or large - it was just right. Normally the portions are so large I have to take food home but this was just nicely filling. Huge menu. Vegetarian options and interesting beer selection.The food came in five minutes - not kidding! I looked at my watch because someone reviewed that it was slow as molasses but literally the food came in five minutes! It wasnt dead but a moderately busy weekday night.The place looks very classy, sleek and modern with the theme of black going on. Super high ceilings. Surrounded by glass with granite tables. About the validated parking - we were there 45 minutes and, even after they validated the parking, we still had to pay $2.50. Also, the parking garage is SO scary. The corners are so tight and there are marks all over the walls where people ran into it. The parking was extremely difficult and there were no spots so we ended up parking on the level that was reserved for valet parking (shh, dont tell!). Will go again ! :)"
9/25/2012,3,"The food here is amazing. I ordered a Bento Box and a Tekka Don for lunch -- I was very hungry! The service is pretty awful in my opinion, no one poured our water and we had to do it ourselves. Service here is definitely strange/borderline awful."
4/22/2013,3,"It's not bad sushi, but it's not good sushi.  It's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's definitely a decent spot for a Chirashi bowl or some Sashimi."
11/15/2015,5,"I can't stand seaweed which is why I steer clear of sushi, but they have a selection made with rice paper and it was great! Very satisfying meal and very healthy. We were able to party after dinner and not feel that overstuffed, with over processed food feeling."
8/2/2008,5,"Orlando Bento is just as good as its Gainesville predecessors. When I'm in Orlando, this is where I go eat because it's my favorite Japanese restaurant ever. Their bento boxes are good; their sushi is AMAZING. Bento is what I miss most about living in Florida, no lies. Super cheap, super tasty. I love you, Bento."
9/16/2011,5,Everything here is great! From the sushi to the bento box. I love the Sushi Don!
12/24/2011,4,"This is my favorite place to go after a show -- it's open late and the sushi is always fantastic.  Check out the ""bowls"" on their menu for the best value -- the salmon bowl is pretty great."
4/9/2012,1,"I've been to this place a few times, only because it's by the movie theater and it's convenient. I think i'll make an effort to go somewhere else next time. The food is so BLAND and lackluster. It's almost like a frozen tv dinner and a side of canned food. The staff is so standoffish and it seems like it's an effort to take our order. It's also really slow, the last time we went it was so empty and yet, they still managed to be as slow as if it was rush hour on a Saturday night. I can understand why people like this place, it looks trendy, it's cheap, and has a perfect location. But I would not waste my money here."
8/13/2015,3,"I'd say this place is definitely good but not great. The service was good and food came pretty quickly. The location was also great if you are doing anything downtown. If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would. I can't go for 4 stars because of menu. Too many rolls on this menu have imitation krab. I'm not a fan. I feel like a high quality sushi restaurant doesn't go for that much imitation meat. We are new to the area from California and I've heard this is common for sushi restaurants in Orlando. They also have tilapia on some rolls. I have never see this at a sushi restaurant before. In my experience, tilapia is mostly farmed, not wild. This makes me question the quality of the other seafood being used. The rolls that we did order were good, though we opted to pay the up charge to substitute some of the lower quality fish for better selections. I would go back here because of location. If location was not a factor and I was simply looking for good sushi, this would not be my choice."
10/3/2009,5,"if you are coming downtown, this to me is the most versitale place to eat.. cheap, good, and perfect location...  service is slower then most, but worth it.  i eat here a minimum of 5 times a week.a must if your going to the movies..dont forget to get your parking validated !!"
5/23/2010,4,"Food is excellent and the price is cheap, but you better have time to waste cause service moves like a snail. On the bright side they are quick to comp a drink cause it's so bad."
7/29/2011,3,"Amazing! I always order the volcano roll and Japanese bagel roll. Though the volcano roll is amazing, it is not the traditional shredded ""krab"" meat mixed with spicy mayo atop a california roll. Still truly amazing! My boyfriend always orders the bento box with a variety of items and also comes with a cute little dessert. The shrimp tempura is MY favorite. I have also had the spicy tuna don. This also comes with a seaweed salad that, to my surprise, tasted awesome. The reason I am not giving Bento 5 stars is because of the times I have sat down to eat here and the to go system. First, every time I eat here service is horrible. Most of the servers are rude and cannot keep the orders accurate. You have to get your own refills and sometimes wait over an hour for your food. Also 2x when i ordered to go, my order wasn't even processed! They charge $0.50 for spicy mayo when most places will give you as much as you want for free. I always need to check my order and receipt because it is never correct (missing soy sauce a lot) and they charge me for stuff I didn't order.In conclusion, food is AMAZING, service is HORRIBLE!"
11/28/2012,1,"Nothing Japanese about this placeLoudTv's everywhere ,bad serviceFood was fair"
12/21/2012,4,Love to come here! The bento boxes are always a great deal and just enough sushi for me. Also the staff have always been pleasant :) My daughter really enjoys it here too.
1/3/2013,2,It took almost 15 minutes to place a take out order with only 2 people in front of me.  For the next 30 minutes I waited and watched them botch every single order.  It was comical.  When I finally received my food I left out of frustration without checking it.  I made it 200 feet outside before I was chased down because I was given the wrong bag.Food was good but we have too many choices in Orlando to put up with such terrible service.
8/26/2010,4,Very nice restaurant inside and very clean. my last visit i had this bento box and it was very good. Only been there once and i am going to say a good time to dine on an evening. Service seems very professional and well mannered. Great sushi too by the way! thank you staff and chefs!!!
1/25/2012,5,"Awesome food. Very tasty. Friendly staff. I have eaten here for years, never had any issues. Hot, fresh tasting noodles or bento boxes! Yummy sushi! Sushi lunch special is the best, high quality low price."
10/5/2012,5,"I love this place! It's got a great combo of Asian dishes and sushi; so it's a perfect when I am out with my non-sushi friends.  I have pretty much tried everything on the menu but prefer the Curry Katsu and Spicy Cream along with any sushi they make.  Love that you can choose between Shrimp, Chicken and Beef with most of the dishes so the variety is awesome! The staff is always delightful and always ready to suggest something.  And the prices is awesome! Their edemame is the best in town by the way."
2/28/2013,5,I don't like sushi and I'm extremely picky about my fried rice (it can easily be ruined). I took one bite out of my fried rice bowl and fell in love with Bento. The prices are amazing and I can't wait to try more of their menu. The portions were perfect and the employees were friendly and took great care of us. Can't wait to go back and get another bowl of friend rice :-)
4/21/2015,5,I get my sushi from Bento at the Solar Bears games. It's the only place I'll get food from in the arena because it's the BEST! Please come back next season. If you don't I'll go hungry at the games!
4/10/2015,5,These guys are great. What a treat to have them at the magic games. It's delicious and one of the only healthy options. I hope to see them in Orlando city's new stadium!
6/7/2013,5,I love Bento!! every time I go visit my ex in orlando we eat here. We especially love the bubba tea and the bento box!!!! And the owner Johnny is very nice as well. Very clean restaurant and the staff always has a big smile on whenever I go. I definitely recommend Bento to all my friends and family.
12/27/2012,5,"Bento is hands down my favorite lunch spot in downtown Orlando. Their call-in service is so quick (I have my food within 10 minutes of calling in) and the portions are filling and generous.I'm impressed by all of their veggie options ( and their menu clearly designates which items are vegetarian). Their tofu blows me away, and I don't say that lightly. It's always chewy and flavorful, never soggy. Even my omnivore friends order the tofu  occasionally - it's that good.The red curry tofu noodle bowl is my all time favorite. It's so creamy, spicy and perfect that I almost always pick it (although the garlic sauce and the basic stir fry are winners too)."
7/7/2010,4,Went to lunch here today for the first time and it was very nice! there was this tempura shrimp covered in a spicy sauce kinda tasted like the spicy mayo sauce they have and it came with white rice .... it was incredibly delicious! then i had the mexican roll but instead of eel sauce i had it with spicy mayo - as you can tell i was in the mood for spicy - but nonetheless it was pretty impressive and very chilling ... especially watching the germany vs spain world cup game! :p
10/30/2010,5,Just came back from Bento Cafe. 10/30/10.I spent Appx: $10 including tip and tax.Ordered: Thai Coconut Yellow Curry Bento BoxFood Quantity: 10/10Food Quality or Taste: 7/10Food Price: 10/10   You get more then what you paid for.Food Menu Choices: 10/10  There's many to choose from.Wait Time: 15 minutes after ordering.I would sacrifice the small portion of yakisoba and string beans for a decent portion of salad and little bit of extra rice.  I like the small dessert portion they provide with the bento meal.Recommend: 10/10For Age: 21 to 35
1/19/2011,5,"I don't know much about traditional or authentic Japanese, but this is my FAVORITE sushi spot! I always go for the Lunch combo, where you can choose two types of regular rolls and you get 4 each, plus 4 California rolls. Your box also comes with a cucumber salad (I think it's called sunomono), seaweed salad (YUM!) and your rolls. All for $8 -- PERFECT for a lunch.My favorite rolls are the Mt. Fuji, Spicy Hotate and Special Mexican. There are also a bunch of ""executive rolls"" which are fancier -- more expensive, tho, and not allowed in the lunch box combo.I'm confused by those who talk about bad service in this place, tho, because it's not really that type of operation. It's counter service, where you go up, place your order & you get a number for your table, so they can bring your order out to you. You even go get your own drinks. What kind of service do you want in a place like that?I've rarely had a less than great experience at this place. Last time I was there, I decided to step away from my usual lunch combo and try the Kawaii rolls -- lighter version, wrapped in lettuce. It was good, but WAYYY too small for me. I left still incredibly hungry.The boba bar is gone (rumor has it it's going to return at Mochi next door very soon) and I understand they're not validating parking in The Plaza's structure anymore. But if you're lucky enough to be able to walk over there or can find street parking, it is definitely worth every penny!"
3/17/2011,5,"I'm mostly in line with dear Tabitha on this review, great food, great place, and theirs a yummy yogurt shop next door more or less. If I had the money it'd be my regular sunday sushi place with the girlfriend."
11/22/2011,1,"So, Bento and I have a bit of a history. I used to order from them all the time on Doorstep Delivery because I wanted to try some sushi rolls in the comfort of my own home. The delivery food was awesome, and was always delicious. Let me be clear, the food is great but...Good luck getting any of that delicious food. The wait staff ignored my wife and I on at least two separate occasions, and from what I'm told, this happens more often than not. So, for delivery, this place is excellent. If you want to actually go to the location, forget it."
3/11/2012,5,"This is one of the best restaurants i've been to in a very long time, and I live near New York City. I food was excellent, i'd say 4.8 out of 5 but what gives it the 5 stars is the overall package. The restuarant design is very nice and modern, the waitress was very friendly and the overall ambience was great. The portions of the food are really big, and I have enough left overs for breakfast. On top of all this is the very reasonable price: if you want to, you can have a really filling dinner for $7.50. I ordered a little bit of everything so I paid more but for everything I got I still had a great deal. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this place is so that you people don't steal it and drive up the prices!"
6/17/2014,4,"I ordered in from Bento, and I was a little worried with the estimated 1 hour wait for the sushi to arrive, but it was delivered in half the time, and the dumplings were still hot! The sushi was good, but I haven't tried enough items on the menu to really pick out what's great and what is so-so, but I'd recommend it, and I'll be ordering from here again."
5/9/2012,1,"Waited for my food for over a half hour, meanwhile I was told it was ""on it's way"". If you forget to make an order just say so, don't lie and make me waste my time. Not worth it."
8/3/2013,3,"I have been to bento cafe in downtown Orlando multiple times and have had the same problem with varying severity: timeliness of seating. Being well versed in how a dining room and patrons should be handled, more often than not, the typical 20-25 minute wait doesn't bother me as I'm usually there on the weekend and 20-25 minutes to be seated seems reasonable to me. However, tonight's experience was bad enough that I felt a review was necessary. I gave 3 stars because the food is always good and at a fantastic value, it borders on great with some dishes. But I came in tonight to celebrate my girlfriend's graduation with her family and was quoted at a 20-25 minute wait. With there being 6 of us, that's no problem. But there were roughly 30 available seats. After waiting 45 minutes I asked why we couldn't sit in any of those available seats and I was told that they were reserved. What restaurant holds a reservation for 30 people for an hour past their reserved time on a Saturday night? During that time, at least 15 people walked out due to frustration. Had they not found a table at the last second, we would've left, too. I understand trying to be patient, but you don't turn away guaranteed business for a group that probably won't show. In case you were wondering, the group never came. If you don't learn how to manage a dining room, great food is going to waste."
7/31/2010,5,"I love Bento! I usually eat here at least once a week ever since being turned on to the place two years ago. I have never had a bad meal there. Ever. The food there is really special. Depending on my mood, I either go with sushi, or a noodle bowl. Can't lose either way. Thing is, they could really get away with charging a bit more, especially in the location it's in. The food is that good! The atmosphere is also fantastic. It's got a really nice, chilled out vibe to it. Modern, and trendy, but not stuck up. It's a great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner. For my friends and I, so many great nights downtown have first started out with a great meal at Bento! Enjoy!"
4/24/2011,5,"Bento was awesome. The decor is amazing. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The restroom is also very interesting, they have a TV in the wall so you do not miss any of the game. I really enjoyed all the food. I did not get to try the sushi yet but the menu looks amazing. I did however get the bento box. It is basically a 3 course meal. It includes a salad and a dessert. I also had the Sakitini. I don't usually like Saki, but I got an apple flavored one and it was really good.The other thing I really loved about it, is that it is so reasonably prices. You can get an entire meal for $10 which is unheard of Downtown."
6/6/2011,4,"So good.  Perfect stop before you hit the movies.  Great looking place, they are fast sweet servers.I love the Asian American cuisines, they only bad food I had was some of there sushi rolls aren't great."
3/7/2012,5,"My girlfriend and I just got home and couldn't wait to write a review. We were very very pleased with the service here. Our waitress was Tammy, and she was talkative, knew her stuff, and was very attentive. It is my birthday today, and my girlfriend's was five days ago, so we were celebrating. And turning 21, we were curious about the alcohol. We ordered two glasses of wine and sampled the sake. We weren't charged for the alcohol, and were given some free Red Bean Ice Cream-- which was yummy. Now I'm boasting, but really, the food was great, well-prepared. It was my girlfriend's first time eating sushi, and now she loves it. We want to become regulars there, it was that good. The prices were very fair as well, especially considering they are in the middle of downtown Orlando.The atmosphere was mellow, fancy, and still casual. I'm no professional, but it's a great place for a first-timer, for a sushi lover, and we stuck to the sushi, but I'm sure all their other stuff is great too. ^^ We ordered some sushi to go, as well. :D We'll definitely be back. P.S-- The Crunch Roll is a must-have!"
7/4/2012,5,Amazing food and atmosphere.  Very good and fresh sushi.  A must check out in Orlando.
12/10/2009,3,"From a Californian's perspective, this place is pretty good because of one thing - the prices! An average descent roll in California is about $10-12, at Bento it's $7! Can't beat that! One gripe though, when the description states spicy, then it should be SPICY! I didn't taste spicyness. I should've brought along my Tabasco for added taste to the rice bowls."
12/12/2009,2,"My friend and I went here for a quick bite before a movie.  We split sushi, soup and pad thai.  If I did not know that we had ordered pad thai, I would have never guessed.  It wasn't bad, or good, but I wouldn't order it again.  The hot and sour soup was neither sour or spicy.  The sushi had too much rice and not enough fish.  With all the other dining options around, I don't see myself coming here again."
10/22/2013,2,Came in on a Sunday night and ordered a lychee sake (they were out so we ordered the white peach...which was the only one they had anyway..) green tea ice cream and a spicy seafood noodle soup bowl. After two tables that had sat down after us received their food and the server never came back after dropping off our waters we had grabbed another server to check on our food. She came back and said she had just fired our order which we had already been waiting 25-30 mins for? Then our original server came back and said our order had been overlooked and then said our entire meal was comped....thanks? I'm assuming the server was new and having our meal comped I gave the two stars.
3/2/2014,3,"I've visited to Bento on three occasions; twice for dine in and once for carry out. Overall the food quality, prices and portions are ok. That being said I only rated 3 stars as the product quality is mediocre at best. Having sampled from both their sushi and hot offerings I found the rice and noodle bows to be the best items. For lunch you can't beat their prices and the staff & atmosphere have always been welcoming."
6/1/2013,3,"This place is ok.  I've been to this place twice.  Once I ate at the bar the second I was with a party of five.  The first time at the bar I was attended very well and the food was delivered without a hitch. The second time it was disastrous.  They sat us down in a booth and then the waitress took forever to take our drink orders.  Then she forgot to put in the order for our appetizers, once she did get around to putting the order in she put it in wrong.   The food took a really long time to come out, as we were sitting waiting for our food we noticed that the sushi chefs were just standing around the food preparation are while there were orders still to come out of the kitchen and the sushi bar.   The only reason that I'm give it three stars is due to the food quality.  You have to know what to order on the menu for you to get good to excellent items, there are other on the menu that don't stand up."
8/5/2013,3,"Really good sushi, but ho-hum bento. My main dish was okay, but the accompanying noodles and beans were quite dry and flavorless (not even soy sauce could moisten the noodles), and the salad and dessert were throwaways (which is kind of to be expected, given the cuisine). The chicken katsu was amazing--not too heavy or greasy at all. I liked the ambience and decor, but unfortunately the women's bathroom was disgusting. I'd go again for takeout sushi or a rice bowl, but not much else."
7/17/2013,4,"Went here on a whim, glad we did. Sushi roll was good and the garlic chicken was delicious without being over the top. Wife had the Orange chicken with noodles and she loved it. We will definitely be back to try the other bentos!"
10/18/2010,2,"This place is not good.  We went here for lunch today and I was pretty excited b/c there were a bunch of people waiting for them to open.  (We got there a little too early).  The food came out slow b/c we were seated with a few other tables.  We tried the veggie spring rolls that tasted store bought and came with packets of duck sauce on the side on a gross piece of lettuce for decoration.  We also had the katana roll which was the best thing we had there.  I made the mistake of ordering the tuna tataki salad bowl which had no flavor at all.  It was by far the worst tuna tataki I've ever had.  We also ordered a roll that was wrapped in cucumber (can't remember what it was called).  It was just ok.  I had the sliced beef udon noodle soup and he had the cajun chicken noodle bowl.  The broth of my soup was really dark brown which was odd.  It was just ok.  I was staarving when we went here (I didn't have breakfast)  so it probably wouldnt have been that hard to impress, but that just shows how bad the food was!  Our bill came out and it was $60 with tip.  What a waste!"
7/26/2013,4,"Since writing the initial review I have visited Bento 3-4 times, with the most recent visit a few days ago. When dining here it has been a positive experience and the food has been great! I might add, the way that the owner handled my last review was above and beyond what I was expecting and really served to make me feel like a valued customer. Will keep Bento in mind as a food option when downtown."
4/21/2010,4,My favorite quick sushi lunch spot. They have great sushi bowls and salad bowls. They have fast service and good food.
6/30/2009,4,This is owned by one of my friend's friend. It's a cool hip Asian fusion place to go to. I do prefer their rice and noodle bowls over their sushi. It's inexpensive and a quick eats type of place. I prefer to go there for lunch.
4/21/2010,4,"This is a good, fast place to get sushi. I have never tried anything other than sushi here, and I haven't had a bad experience. Their volcano roll is pretty good. It is more of a quick lunch spot than a dining experience, but I was impressed with their sushi. I tried a Boba drink before and I am personally not a fan, but if you like that sort of thing maybe you'd like them there. Their seaweed salad was always good, too. Give it a try."
9/2/2012,4,"I was looking for a light lunch and ended up ordering a dragon roll. It was pretty standard, though the sweet sauce on top was really delicious. The cashier was very friendly and struck up conversation while she was ringing my order up. Great value for the price- I love sushi but can never find a place that won't leave my wallet completely empty, and this did it for me. I'll definitely have to try a bento box next time I pay them a visit."
1/28/2013,2,"I've  coming to Bento Downtown Orlando for some time for lunch.  I am addressing the lunch experience and have not been here for Dinner.  At lunch time, you stand in line to order before being seated (Similar to fast food).  They subsequently hand you a plastic number, and you go on your way and wait for your food to arrive (it is brought to the table in a one time trip from the server).  Typically, if you order there anytime after 11:30, you are faced with a cramped long line at the door.  Call ahead ordering is a little better, but make sure you order at around 11, as you are still forced to wait in the long line of people who did not call ahead.  While they claim to have a register dedicated to pick up, it is not clearly labeled as such, and you face scowls from those waiting in line who believe you are cutting in front of them.There are two menu styles.  I have tried both, with varying measures of satisfaction.  The sushi receives a higher grade than the bento boxes or rice bowls.  The regular rolls are generously portioned and the executive rolls are equally generous.  The executive rolls, while pricier, are generally tastier and more creative.  I have had only one bad experience with the sushi where the scallops that topped my roll were overcooked.  Overall, the sushi and rolls get a solid A-.  The rice bowls and bento boxes are inconsistent.  One day, they are good when ordered, while other days they are not as good.  This inconsistency has caused me to Order these entrees with caution or not at all.  For this reason, the bento boxes and rice/noodle bowls get a C-The most compelling reason behind two stars as opposed to three or even four is the service.  I have never had incredible service here, but my most recent visit (today) has left me wondering if I ever want to return. It should be noted that there are not a lot of choices for lunch in Downtown Orlando.  As such, I will probably be returning when I get tired of the scarce other choices in Orlando, but if so, it is under protest.  Upon receipt of a large bill for payment, the person who was taking my Order informed me that she did not have change.  While I understand that it was a large bill, I would expect a place in the middle of downtown Orlando to have change at least have access to a manager who does.  She didn't bother to ask a manager to assist.  She instead displayed and attitude and became combative when I insisted that I had nothing smaller.  She even went so far as to request that I go get change from somewhere else.Finally, when I persisted that I did not have anything smaller, and was unwilling to go anywhere unless she accepted my bill, she proceeded to get me the change that she claimed she did not have.  In my opinion, this Bento location has a history of hiring young attractive women to work the front registers.  However, attractiveness does not compensate for insufficient problem solving and customer service skills."
10/26/2008,4,"Hell's good stuff!   went there on our way downtown and it looks a little highend for me, we checked out the menu and the staff was great!   they helped us with our order and we had a blast!!!"
11/19/2022,5,Love their bento box and mex rollToo Love the Thai soup aswellCustomer service is great
11/18/2022,3,"I would still have to say this place is a solid three stars.I received a virtual gift card, and two of the staff had no idea how to put it into the computer to apply it. It took a few tries, but they finally figured it out.Food is just alright. I ordered the sushi bento again which I found some of the sushi pretty bland, and my husband tried the udon soup which he said the same. Boba tea is pretty good, but I asked to sub the honey Boba for popping boba, and they wanted to charge .75 for it so I kept the honey boba. I can get if I wanted to add extra boba, but I don't understand charging to substitute when you're taking something away.Service was a lot faster than last time, but for some reason, even though the server double checked, we asked to dine in and they put to go.This is a place I'd come to again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for. I'd definitely come just for boba if I'm in one of the plazas on Sand Lake."
9/16/2022,1,Second time I've given then a chance in the past two weeks. Last time they had us waiting more than 20 minutes for a chicken and veggie bowl...... As I watched ppl come in and be deuces in 5 minutes. I cancelled the order.I'm sitting here now waiting on a simple to go order since they haven't had air conditioning for a week..... No fans in the dining room...Ridiculous
12/13/2022,5,This restaurant is a gem. The atmosphere and ambiance is nice. It does resemble an authentic Asian restaurant. You have to order at the desk and get a number but it moves fast and the staff is engaging. Staff will help you with choices and recommendations. The food is wonderful. We have only tried the Mt Fuji roll and the Hot lava roll. The Hot Lava roll is absolutely amazing. It does have cooked scallops on the top so seafood allergy people beware. If not allergic it is well worth it. The prices are reasonable and they are military and veteran friendly with a 10% discount. I do not give recommendations easily but I recommend you try this spot
7/12/2022,4,"Having never been here before, I was told by a friend that I NEEDED to try it. When we walked up I was pleasantly surprised by the menu options and the service. It was a busy Saturday night but the woman still helped me and answered all my questions. I ordered a bento box with tofu as well as a Lychee boboa tee milk smoothie. The smoothie came out right away and was very good. The rest of the food came out shortly after and the tofu, rice and noodles were delicious. The side green beans and salad left some to be desired but overall it was a meal. I was a bit unhappy with the dirtiness of the place as well as the pricing ( two meals and a smoothie for 47 dollars) but overall it is a place I will be visiting again."
1/25/2022,3,"Went with the Pao pao chicken ($14) (they did not have shrimp available) and the add on of a pork egg roll and a drink for $4.5.The meal was good, green and red peppers were crisp and the string beans were not soggy either. Service was quick and I was back to work."
3/1/2022,3,"Yum! So many options, so little time. Really enjoyed this quick serve Asian restaurant which offers sushi, bowls and stir fry options. I opted for the Sesame Stir Fry in a white rice bowl with shrimp. I was surprised to find 6 shrimp in the bowl which is a more ample serving than most places. It came with roasted veggies like broccoli, zucchini, carrots, red peppers and mushrooms in a soy sauce. Really tasty and generous portion. Coke fountain beverage options along with Boba teas and beers. You order at the counter, and the food is brought to your table. Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices. Low FODMAP and gluten-free eaters may find it challenging to find onion or GF options with all the sauces. A little on the pricey side, but the food was fresh. Nice lunch option."
5/18/2022,3,"This was my first time trying a restaurant like this. Me and my family came in on a Saturday night, there wasn't much of a line and it wasn't packed. I like the amount of varieties/ options their menu has. You could literally mix and match anything you wanted, and ordering was very simple. Our appetizers came out in about 5 minutes and our food followed behind about 8 minutes after. Everything was hot, and although all of us got something very different everything was correct. All of us enjoyed our food, my only thing is I wish I received more teriyaki sauce with my bowl and I wish the noddles were more flavorful. Other than that it was good."
11/28/2022,5,The place was clean and the staff was nice and attentive. We had a party of 3 and everyone ordered a different meal. The service was pretty quick and the food was prepared correctly. As for taste - very good is a great way to summarize it. Overall a great spot.
2/3/2022,5,Another winner for me. I love this place. It's right next to my friends apartment and the food is just so delicious. I go for their General Tso Chicken bowl w/ extra green beans because it's just so good and crunchy. I also love their garlic edamame. Every time i went there it was for to go. So I haven't dined inside but I am sure it's a great experience. I definitely try to come here at least once a month since it is a 15 min drive from my home.
1/3/2022,4,Stopped at Bento's on the way to Trader Joe's with my son for dinner. I don't frequent Bento's often. We ordered 2 build your own bowls and 2 bobas. I ordered a kids bowl with 1 protein and my son ordered a regular. When they brought our bowls out they forgot my avocado but chopped some up for me when I brought my bowl up to them. After all the poke places I have been to around town I think I like Bento's for the variety of toppings available. I had shiitake mushrooms and my son added kimchi to his bowl. Those are not available at most places. Avocado is usually an up charge at most places too but not at Bento so definitely a plus. The price per bowl is a little more though. The service was good. The staff was friendly. I think I would come back for more poke bowl.
3/6/2022,5,"Love coming to bentos, definitely one of my favorite places. The wait time is never too crazy and the staff is always nice. You can never go wrong with any of their bowls or their boba!"
9/9/2022,5,"Very nice! The workers were attentive and friendly. Good selection of food options and portion size was decent. I got the yellow curry, not spicy. We would come back for sure!"
10/23/2022,4,"Ordered through Grubhub for delivery at the Hard Rock hotel. Order arrived timely, correct and the food was tasty! Pao Pao chicken was wonderful! Delivery was smooth (gave instructions to meet at the round about in front of the hotel). Highly recommend for resort delivery!"
2/10/2022,4,"Great place to eat Japanese food. I ate the Orange Chicken which was sweet and definitely delicious. The pork dumplings were sautéed perfectly. I would definitely recommend coming here for a great, quick bite to eat."
12/4/2022,3,Food was good but a little too salty. I got the Mongolian chicken and Shrimp and there was barely any chicken. Portions could be a bit better. The rolls were great though!
11/6/2022,1,"That's the second time I visited this place, same issue, Horrible customer service and expensive."
6/18/2022,5,"Great little sushi and Japanese restaurant They take your order off  the menu when you walk in and give you a number to put your at table and deliver it to youThe line was long when I walked in but moved along very quickly I ordered the sushi bento box, ginger salad and miso soupEverything came out fairly quickly even though they were crowded Everything was excellent. Sushi was fresh and soup and salad were great Servers were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean Great experience and excellent food Would definitely go back"
2/28/2022,4,"This is my go to quick service sushi spot. I'm in love with the Florida roll because you get salmon and tuna, avocado and cc. All my favorite ingredients. I also love the garlic string beans. It's a nice compliment to sushi because it's really crunchy and seasoned. Perfect balance. The staff is always friendly and the food never takes that long. Lots of tables inside and booths clean as well. I love coming here. It's a casual atmosphere but it's also a great spot if you want to come here with family and friends. I also love that they service Boba tea here! I find myself coming here about 2-3 times a month to get my sushi craving covered. Highly recommend. Never had a bad meal here. It's not high quality sushi but you get what you pay for. It's worth it."
9/26/2021,5,"I ordered takeout from this restaurant for dinner. I ordered the miami roll, steamed pork dumplings, and miso soup. I enjoyed all of the food. It was still hot when I received my order and the sushi was very fresh. I would recommend this place for sushi and more."
1/27/2022,5,I love this place so much. How can you not when they have spicy pao pao. The service is fast and efficient. Every staff is always so kind and helpful. I enjoy everything on the menu. Their bento box is cost efficient and a great deal of food.
7/9/2021,5,"This has to be my favorite asian fusion restaurant in Orlando! My husband was raving about Bento and we finally went on a Friday night around 6 PM so I could try it out. The restaurant decor is modern and hip. You pick up a menu, pay at the counter, and then find a place to sit. As a vegetarian, I had tons of options to choose from. I decided to do the Tofu bento box, you can choose from white or brown rice, and then pick your main entre. I decided on the veggie stir fry that would come with the protein of my choice, Tofu! We also did the avocado sushi rolls. My husband ordered the coffee boba tea which he  loved. After we paid, they give you a number stand and you can then place it on the table you sit at. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, it came out within 10 minutes. My tofu stir fry was delish! The tofu was flavored perfectly and the garlic sauce that coats it was so flavorful. The bento box also comes with salad, lo mein noodles, and veggies. The avocado sushi rolls were equally good and everything just tasted fresh. The only negative is that it is pricy but well worth it. Overall, I'm surprised by the 3.5 star rating. This is a solid restuarant and I'd be back to try more of their offerings!"
8/9/2021,1,"This was the worst sushi place I've ever ate at. It reminded me of hospital food. The tofu was like eating a kitchen sponge. The food quality in my opinion is terrible.** I received a reply from this place asking if I would email them what menu items I had so they could verify if their recipe was being followed so they could make my next visit great?????? Not sure if it was an automatic response but the store owner should consider sending some unknown patrons in to order and investigate this themselves. At this point, I don't recall exactly what we ate, ( other than the tofu was God awful, but would never try it again. I don't get to eat tofu out all that often so when I do, I'm super happy but this was the worst tofu I ever had."
1/29/2022,1,"We're a party of three who ordered through ubereats. 2 of us received orders a bit different than ordered. Mine was meant to be a chicken and tofu paopao with added bok choy but I received a tofu teriyaki (the sauce was v sweet and had sesame seeds in it) and my cousin ordered a gochujang bento but what she received definitely wasn't gochujang. The poke bowl (although the pic is blurry) was exactly as ordered. The bentos were good! We were never going to complain, however as I was eating the broccoli from my main dish I felt something hard. I assumed maybe it was a bone or something and spit it out to inspect it but it was a literal piece of metal . I'm in shock. I've never had this happen before! It's a piece of almost gold or copper colored metal. Looks like it chipped off of something (I don't have metal dentistry at all so not from me). That definitely tipped me into mildly annoyed to completely upset. That's a safety issue!"
2/22/2022,4,"Bento is always a solid, reliable option for sushi in our house! Prices are reasonable, sushi is decent, but nothing out of this world amazing. I love the poke bowls, and usually get the 'small' or 'child' portion - it's only a little smaller with only one protein option, but still 5 toppings! They also have a decent happy hour with BOGO beer Monday - Friday 4-7. They no longer have servers so everything is order at the counter, seat yourself, and then they bring out your food. Sushi's never the fastest food, but Bento is pretty good on timing unless they are super busy, so you're never waiting more than 20 mins. Overall, it's a great place for decent, quick sushi!"
5/19/2021,2,"So far yikes. Not rude or anything but not very friendly staff. They gave me tuna instead of salmon in my poke bowl. When I asked her about it she just said no that's tuna and grab the ball and dumped it in the trash. She turned around and I saw her go to the cashier and was not nice to him. All she had to do was say no that's not tuna and add some salmon. I wasn't blaming her nor was I rude. I've been to other locations and I've never had any problems so the order being wrong wasn't a big deal. It was the way it was handled. Anyway. Place is very clean and the food is always fresh. Food is always so good. Today is my birthday so I'm gonna be nice and keep a 4 star because everything is all good here.Wait Nevermind.... not even an I'm sorry and when I got the replacement it was wrong again.The table next to me got refunded on 2 items, a visit from the manager and they actually asked them if they needed anything else.  Lol. Well yes sir I did but not anymore."
1/5/2022,3,The entree was of decent size. We ordered for delivery. I liked that the bento came with a lot of sides. The taste was ok. Nothing special. Sushi was ok as well. A bit pricey for the taste in my opinion
7/24/2022,5,I always receive friendly & expert service at Goldsmith's.  This is where I take my jewelry to be repaired or created.
7/18/2020,5,"Bento is one of my favorite semi fast food restaurants. The food is good quality, they  have a variety of options, and you cant beat it for the value. They are currently only offering take out, but they have outside tables so we were able to order and sit outside. Grub hub and uner eats also offer deliver. The line outside waslong, but our food only took 20 min and our order was perfect and packaged well. They have so much to choose from; bowls, sushi, and bento boxes. We ordered two bento boxes: the monogolian steak box and a  Sriracha garlic chicken box, and also ordered the caliente sushi. The monogolian steak was cooked well, packed with flavor and quite filling. My  Sriracha  chicken was spicy, but the spice wasn't overwhelming. The caliente roll was filled with crab, jalepeno, and topped with yellowtail tuna- we enjoyed it. Sad that we couldnt dine in, but glad we came."
5/14/2021,5,"First time eating and dining in at this location. Food was great, service was alright, and the seating is kind of funky. Compared to the location on University, this location is mediocre. Told the cashier that I had a seafood allergy and he told me that they cannot guarantee cross contamination."
7/16/2022,5,i love this place. i get the build your own poke bowl and it is soooo so good. last time i went i had the jasmine milk tea and it was amazing. allof the food i have seen people get looks delicious as well. this place is very vegetarian friendly. they give you a lot of food in your bowl. i had enough to take home for lunch the next day and it was still good as leftovers!
6/8/2022,1,Not Japanese food.  Americanized to the point I could really recognize the dishes.  The red curry over rice?  Rice was not prepared properly and there wasn't enough curry.  The Pad Thai was terrible.  No nigiri sushi only rolls with odd ingredients like cream cheese.  If you are expecting good Asian food.  This is not the place to go.
3/14/2022,3,"It's a shame that I have to write this, but I feel it is my duty to make others aware that there is a possibility that the quality of the food at this location may not be up to par. On Saturday, 12MAR22, I ordered a Build-Your-Own Poké Bowl through GrubHub. I ordered salad as my base, with the addition of the soy tuna and fried tofu as my proteins. I added asparagus, edamame, and cucumbers along with tempura flakes and Furikake. As I was eating my meal, every few bites something tasted ""off""-- I was thinking maybe it was just me since not every single bite was unappealing. I get to the bottom of the bowl, and unfortunately, I found a bug. It was laying there, legs and all for me to see. I was immediately grossed out and called GrubHub. I explained that I did not expect a full refund since I *did* happen to eat to the bottom of the bowl, however, I did feel that I was due some sort of compensation for finding a bug in my food. GrubHub handled the situation swiftly and with professionalism. It was two of my dear friends who suggested that I post this review along with the photo proof so that other patrons can make a fully informed decision as to ordering the poké bowl at this restaurant. To clarify; I'm only discouraging other customers from ordering a poké bowl, as there might not be a quality issue with their other food offerings."
4/11/2020,5,"I absolutely love Bento. There's a little something for everyone. There's sushi, poke bowls, bento boxes, and bowls. I regularly eat here for dine or takeout.One of my favorite dishes is the garlic Sriracha (I usually get it with chicken). It has such a yummy flavor that's a bit on the spicy side, so be careful if you don't like spice.The poke bowls are great. You can choose from a couple of predetermined combos, but I find it so much more fun to build your own. The staff has always been super friendly when I've come in whether it be for dine in or takeout. Definitely keep an eye on their social media accounts for any specials or deals they run."
1/12/2021,5,Very classy establishment friendly attentive staff. Good food reasonably priced. Phoned order in had to wait its very busy and Being a little early
5/27/2022,1,"Slow, confused, unstaffed restaurant.  Their work stations are filthy with food on the floor, uncovered food sitting out in the open for long periods of time. Many people waiting for orders much longer than told initially. Don't bother. A waste of time."
2/8/2020,5,"As much as I prefer ""mom and pop"" shops and small vendors, I must say I am impressed by Bento's service. I was planning an event a month im advance with an up-and-coming sushi chef who then never emailed me an invoice or menu, then I began to plan with a mom and pop sushi restaurant which I personally recommend - and they informed me two days before my event they can no longer cater nor deliver. Luckily there's Google and I found a vendor called ezcater which took me to Bento. I've dinned at Bento's plenty of times but I was looking to order sashimi which I know they don't have... But here I was a two days before my event and I just needed some sushi! I encountered issues with delivery time and Bento's opening time via ezcater... but luckily I came in contact with Jade Pham- Catering Manager for Bentos and Less than 24 hours before my event of 20, Jade was able to accommodate an early pick up!The order was on time, included all utensils, was visually appealing, everyone raved about the taste, and the portions were just as noted on their catering menu.Thank you Jade and the Bento team!"
7/10/2021,5,"The cream chicken spicy on udon noodles is a home run if you're hungry but don't know what to order. I haven't had their sushi but from what I saw on the surrounding tables, it was a grand slam"
3/3/2022,5,Great spot for fast and easy poke bowls. With the quality of a sit down restaurant in five minutes. Very happy we found this place so we could get back to exploring the area.
5/22/2021,5,This place never disappoints! I often get the bamboo roll which I love but the other day I decided to get the veggie stir fry bento box and that was a home run! The family loves coming here as it is always reliable and of great quality.
8/14/2022,2,"This place went down hill after Covid. I used to come here all the time but I'll never come back. They changed the menu and have so many limitations. I ordered a simple bento box that took almost 30 minutes to come out because they prioritized the to-go orders. They have terryaki and steak but you can't get them together anymore, makes sense. They changed the wonton chips to basic regular Chinese food wontons with no flavor and no longer serve the dipping sauce which was the best part of coming here."
12/6/2019,4,"Good spot for lunch! They have a happy hour special where you buy 2 rolls and you get a classic roll for free. I haven't tried their sushi yet but it does look tasty. It does seem like they can get backed up during peak lunch and dinner hours.However, their thai pineapple fried rice is a must have! I get it with steak and shrimp for an extra 3.00$. So worth it! The past couple days I've also tried their udon shrimp tempura soup, shrimp pad Thai, and fried pork dumplings! All very tasty dishes!! The tables and soda station can use a little more attention but overall clean dining room as well!"
2/17/2022,5,"Overall meals are prepared well and pickup time is always fast! Great service and one time they messed up my order and the manager was very nice and gave me a gift card to come back, so I feel like the management cares about their customers and take pride in doing things right."
6/21/2020,5,"Ah Bento, how I love thee. First things first, check-in! I got a deal on the Yelp app that said ""one free appetizer with a $10 purchase."" I got my usual lo mein noodle bowl with Pao Pao Spicy Cream chicken and as my free appetizer I got the krab wontons which were fried amazingly but the dipping sauce was not that amazing.My noodles tasted phenomenal, they also udon or ramen noodle options, and the spicy chicken has the perfect amount of sweet and spicy mix. It does have veggies included in the dish such as sweet peppers so if you don't like it I would said opt out. Though I did not get it this time, their mongolian beef with rice bowl with white rice is another amazing option as well as their general tso chicken with any rice or noodle option! Sometimes, I get the spicy cream chicken bento box which is pretty filling and offers great variety if you don't want to settle for just rice or noodles."
8/4/2022,5,Always great quality food & quickly prepared . Never had an issue with my orders . I can always count on this location when I'm looking for a quick well rounded meal.
7/18/2022,1,I ordered Togo and got food poisoning... the food was great but the aftermath wasn't.
5/20/2020,4,"I ordered to go from Bento last night and had an excellent meal. Ordering was easy on Postmates. I decided to try the General Tso's Chicken with Fried Rice and an Egg Roll. I ordered and left my house, it took 30 minutes to get there and food was ready when I arrived. I asked if they had a spicy mustard and they did not.  The only hot sauce option was a spicy mayo. I like using it on my egg roll.  Everything else was perfect in the bag.  I drove home and opened it. It was still hot! I love it when I food is packed well and stays hot. The egg roll was more than I expected. It was an orderOf two and they were cut in half.  These could have been packed better. The plastic clamshell didn't not keep these warm.  I heated them in the oven and they were good.  I wish I had some hot mustard though. The chili soy sauce was ok.  The Fried Rice was worth the upgrade it was delicious. It had a lot of great flavor and veggies.  There was a good size portion and it paired well.  Now onto the General Tso's.  It had a nice flavor but lacked the most important part, heat.  There was no red pepper or hot flavor with it.  They did give you a good amount of broccoli for veggies.  Overall it was a great meal that could have been improved with a better packaging for the egg roll, a hot sauce option, and some heat on the General Tso's. I will definitely be going back and look forward to trying some other dishes."
3/3/2021,1,"My boyfriend decided to order a poke bowl after his grueling 12 hour shift today. He was raving about how good it was until I heard him pause and a look of horror came on to his face. He then proceeded to pull out a screw from his mouth. There was a full blown SCREW in his poke bowl. How this could even happen is beyond me. I've never seen this before. He literally could have died if he ingested this. I don't know how careless a restaurant has to be to accidentally mix in a large metal object into their food, but this place is doing it. Do not order from here. We are both traumatized and I hope this does not happen to anyone else."
11/14/2021,1,"Very disappointing experience!!! Because American Social was to busy next for we decided we would give Bento a try, and really disappointed we did. The same amount of time we would have waited at AS we waited the same amount of time to only have our order lost. With very patrons in the restaurant we still had to wait 30 minutes for food that didn't even taste good. In fact, our chicken was undercooked so after all the waiting we just threw it away along with the money we spent."
6/6/2019,3,"I've had bento here at this location several times, as it's a pretty good place to stop and get some food with friends after doing an activity in the area. Yesterday I ordered their vegetable stir fry bento box with chicken and white rice. My husband ordered the pow pow chicken rice bowl. His pow pow chicken was delicious (probably the best thing I have tried here), and my vegetable stir fry chicken was pretty decent too. Even though I have been here several times, I have yet to have a ""favorite"" meal because I am never ""in love"" with what I eat. The food is good, but never really all that great, however the pow pow chicken may have changed that. Out of ordering a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box, I usually go for the bento box style, as I like the variety of having the rice, noodles, ginger salad, green beans and little wonton dessert, along with your main protein choice. I have had their boba tea before and hated it, as there were still large chunks of ice left it in and it was not blended smoothly at all. Plus the flavor was far too artificial tasting that I just said I would never order another one again."
2/19/2020,4,"Great spot for lunch! Prices are totally reasonable, food was delicious, staff was conscientious. I had the TNT roll with the salad. Came with ginger dressing as advertised and was exactly what was expected. No disappointment here. I really enjoyed the TNT roll, the seared tuna was delicious. The people I went with all ordered different things and everyone enjoyed their meal, but that is as much as I can offer because I didn't try anyone else's food. I am looking forward to my next visit and would absolutely recommend this place!"
1/7/2019,4,"I've heard mixed reviews about this Bento location but after trying it out, I would definitely come back. Eating Bento 4 years straight during my UF days, I know their menu pretty well. This however is the first Bento location I've been to where you don't order first and then sit while a foodrunner brings you your food. This is much more formal as a dine-in restaurant. With that, there comes wait times.Walking in, I had a 25 minute wait for a party of 5 on a Saturday night. Then, we had to wait for our server to bring us our drinks. We had to wait for our server to take our orders. Wait for the food. I didn't like this style as I'm much accustomed to the fast paced Bento the other locations practice. Anything I needed, I needed to wait for the server.All our food came out delicious though. There was only 1 person in our party who mentioned that their chicken was cold. I ordered nigiri sushi. You get 2 pieces of nigiri for $4.50. I tried their salmon, shrimp and eel. They were fairly large but fresh and tasty. I also ordered the udon noodle soup. A favorite of mine. They had provided it with 4 pieces of shrimp tempura on the side. The shrimps were not the large shrimp tempuras but smaller pieces which I liked. My son ordered the kids bento box and it came with string beans, lo mein, his chicken teriyaki and a wonton chips dessert. It was a great deal for the price of $7. The restaurant was clean and the service was great. Our waitress was very friendly."
2/25/2020,4,"Popped in for a quick lunch with my husband and took advantage of the sushi promotion. Monday - Friday from 3pm - 6pm you can enjoy buy 2 get 1 sushi rolls. We went with the TNT roll and the crunch roll and selected the rainbow roll for our free roll.  They also had a bogo beer promotion so we split 2 Sapporo's. Our total came to $31 with tip which is a steal.The rainbow roll was the run of the mill classic but the fish tasted really fresh. The TNT roll came apart immediately when we tried to eat it but the flavor profiles made up for the lack of stability. The star of the show was the crunch roll. It was crispy, fresh and delicious! I would definitely order again.4 stars for a quick service sushi spot that leaves you feeling full and satisfied."
4/7/2020,5,"I absolutely love this place. This place has amazing selections that are not expensive and you can also make bento boxes. They also have Boba tea which is my absolute favorite drink! They have really good lunch specials as well. I believe they also offer a theme park employee discount as well. They are located near universal, and downtown Orlando. It's a great place to try new Asian dishes you haven't tried before."
3/10/2019,4,"Mmmm love this place. So glad they came to open up Bento restaurants in Orlando. When I was in college in Gainesville, I would eat here 2 or 3 times a week!Favorites:1) Curry Pork Katsu over rice2) Salmon & Eel sushi don3) Spicy Cream ChickenThe Food: by no means is it fancy or super authentic, but it tastes good and usually hits the spot for me. Good sized portions.The Space: there's a large amount of room for parties of all sizes. Today we came as a group of 8 and they sat us right away.The Service: friendly workers, helpful with orders and bringing out the food. Usually you go to the counter and order your food. However, some days or times of the day they change it to a sit down and order it from the wait staff.Worth it? Yes, for Asian fusion food, this is a staple for me when I'm back in Orlando."
9/28/2019,3,"It's been a while since I have been to Bento, and I was a bit disappointed in my recent visit.  Service seems to have taken the biggest hit recently - it just seems like there isn't anyone who is acting as a manager.   Lines are long and they seem to be only focused on to-go orders, they can't really explain the ordering process or menu, no please or thank you, chaos when delivering food, etc.  The food itself is now just ""ok"".  Very greasy, fatty, weird flavor, etc.  Not sure I will go back."
12/7/2021,1,"Horrible experiences. Three times in a row they charged me for ""extras"" that they claim they were out of (after the fact), but never advised us of same either when ordering or picking up. AND STILL CHARGED US THE EXTRA MONEY. THREE TIMES IN A ROW. We will NEVER give them another dime of our business and advise that you don't waste your money on them, either. What a shame. They used to be good. Now, they don't even try."
6/7/2018,4,"Came to Bento because of a local friend's high recommendation and it did not disappoint! The Bento Box is the only way to go here, hands down! I got the creamy garlic shrimp (which don't let the sauce name fool you, it is more of a garlic citrus than anything else) bento and was floored w/how much you get for $11!? Also, be sure to use your check-in offer for a free app. The fried dumplings are where it's at over  the steamed #trust. I also got their house cold sake & a Sapporo for a quasi-makeshift sake bomb and both were very reasonably priced. The atmo is good as is the service. When we walked in the place was practically empty, but it filled up fairly quickly, but our waiter was on top of it and our drinks/food came out so fast!Would def recommend and I will def be back next time I visit Orlando!"
12/7/2021,1,"unfortunately we had a horrible experience at bento asian kitchen in dr phillips, orlando! it was an internet/pick-up order. one of the dishes was supposed to have extra boc choy, which they charge for, but were out of. there was also supposed to be extra bean sprouts, but they didn't put any. this is the third time this restaurant has failed us! we should have trusted our better judgement, but didn't. the manager ""echo"" (claims is her real name) was not at all apologetic! she offered to refund the one meal, but had no concern about the lack of attempting to contact us to advise they were out of ingredients! yet they had no problem charging for the missing/neglected ingredients. we are contacting corporate to advise of our complete dissatisfying treatment. our tecommendation is eat taco bell before choosing bento asian kitchen!!!"
4/1/2018,4,"Yum yum yum! Sushi! I really like the sushi here. I had their signature dynamite roll and it was very fresh and flavorful. My friends had the bento box and I helped them finish their plates, and their chicken was so delicious. I didn't like that we all didn't get our food at the same time but they were busy... but still! Although they were busy, you can tell the staff was on it to ensure a great dining experience. Oh and the pork roll as an appetizer... wow! That was delicious! And they have eel sauce! Done. Sigh, I wanna go back!"
3/16/2021,3,such great amazing food!! always so yummy! however it feels like staff doesn't want to be interacting with customers and is kind of rude at times. I do recommend eating there
10/10/2018,5,"Best bento  food in town. Never disappointed with the food every time visit. Tonight is Saturday and the place is packed even on the rainy day. The staff is friendly and it took a little bit longer for the food to get to the table, but the food are still very delicious. We order Szechuan beef noodles,udon stir fry Chicken, I would give it a 5 star review for making the food so delicious and it makes me feel like I could eat that all over again.If you are near these places Gainesville Jacksonville Orlando and soon Winter Park be sure to go to the restaurant to see what you've been missing and whenever you have the craving for delicious food bento  is the place to go so be happy to enjoy it's delicious and wonderful contentsOur waitress is extremely friendly and when we asked for more rice, she brings it to the table with no problem. We had great dining experience!"
10/23/2018,4,"Love the new additionsWhat did I getI got the pick 2 poke bowl (Regular I believe). I got double the salmon (regular and spicy). I got it with half brown rice (didn't cost extra!) and half greens. The protein portion is surprisingly good. I asked for half and half on the base... but it was only a layer of veggies covering a big bed of brown rice. I also got 2 sauces, I am not a sauce person... But I am surprised they did not have wasabi mayonnaise... Overall it was a decent bowl of PokeEnvironmentQuite busy during lunch hours. During that time they usually have the order and then sit down and they bring you the food. In the plaza where Bar Louie is, decent amount of parking but can get busy. Once you place your order, you get a number and they bring you the food. There is also utensils and fountain machine to help yourself.Niceness of the staffThe line went pretty quick. The staff that brought out the food was really nice and offered to bring anything else neededDollarI thought the poke was quite pricey. The 2 poke was for $11. They do have a mini bowl with one poke and that is for $9.Yes?I have always been a fan of their for years, getting the noodle or rice bowls. The poke addition is great! Just need to add more greens in the half and half pokes.#WendyWanders"
2/25/2022,4,"Ate here a couple of times, food is amazing, pretty good portion and they also have boba which is amazing and it was really good too I literally have nothing bad to say, the service was great also."
10/16/2020,5,The server Spencer... Best customer service I have had. Verbatim. Can't explain how much he helped. ABOVE and BEYOND his duties.Can't push this enough. The meal? 8/10. Spencer's help? 11/10.
1/24/2018,3,"I don't usually check in to this Bentos, it is by my job and I honestly forget. I order from here frequently...sometimes sushi, but mostly the Pad Thai or something similar.For a chain restaurant, they are decent, however I must PROTEST their change in spring rolls. They used to be good and bigger...now they are SMALL and always look over fried to me. This is very disappointing. I don't know if they changed distributors or what, but it was a BAD choice. They need to go back to what was already good. As they say, if it ain't broke, DON'T fix it!That is why they are getting 2 stars.Will I still eat here...YES... I love Asian food and sushi, but watch what you order.UPDATE:::: added another star for their Boba Drink Selections. Various flavors and add-ins.Worth a try!!!!!"
10/19/2017,4,"Came by for lunch with a friend and was a bit taken back, I normally love bento cafe but this is the third time I've come in and they deliver one meal and forget to bring the other person's meal. For starters we ordered edamame and for my lunch I ordered SZECHUAN BEEF NOODLE SOUP my friend ordered sushi that looked amazing by the way. Our appetizer came out instantaneously so which was a plus, my meal came out and then we had to wait for 15 minutes for my friends sushi, now I was brought up not to eat in front of someone if they're not eating so I opted to wait. By the time his sushi came out my soup was cold. I tried to speak to the people bringing the food out to see if they would be able to give me an idea but no one stopped as I tried to get their attention so I just gave up. Overall, the young man taking my order was very sweet. The food was good but the rest, we'll have to try again...."
7/10/2020,3,"Bento is one of those fast-casual chains that gets a lottttt of stuff right. You cant really walk into the place and complain about the service, the portions, or especially the prices. I personally love the customizable nature that their menu offers, such as the option to grab only half a roll of sushi for $4 instead of spending the whole $8 and wasting food. Plus the Bento boxes are a good value! But, every time I go, I'm struck by how unmemorable the food is, specifically the sushi. It's bland--kinda feels like airport sushi sometimes. If you're looking for run-of-the-mill, American-style sushi, this is the place to go. Heck, I know at the very least my stomach is filled when I visit bc the portions are again very substantial. But the sushi gets more bland every time I come. HOWEVER, upon posting this review the first time, the business owner replied and told me that they do in fact serve nigiri and sashimi, both options I was unaware of until the business owner of this particular restaurant made it clear they offer both selections on a ""secret menu."" So I will deeeefinitely be back to try those, and hopefully they will be good!I will say, when we went to this particular Bento, the staff was very friendly, got our food to us in as timely a manner as possible at lunch rush, and everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. I guess i just need to start ordering the pad thai."
9/21/2020,4,This was pretty good. I order online and picked it up. They only issue is I order right when they open and it stated it wouldn't be ready until 45 min. Which was strange. I waited only to find out it been ready way before that.
5/2/2020,5,Probably my favorite local Asian flair food! I 100% recommend their sushi as the price is so legit as well as I recommend the orange chicken on Udon and of course the spring rolls! The husband enjoys any of their tofu options. Love that they deliver during this time for when we crave it but what to maintain our quarantine.
9/16/2019,2,"This place has gone down the trash. The dining room is filthy and no one to clean. There's maybe 5 tables sitting. It's 3:15 on a Monday so it's after the lunch rush. Employees just hanging out chatting. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location again. I used to recommend Bentos to everyone, but no more. I'm in the hospitality industry and I will not be telling my guests staying at my hotel to come here again. I try over and over agin to give it another chance but no more. Downtown Bento will be the place I go to from now on."
6/20/2021,5,"One of our favorite chains since we discovered it in Gainesville 10+ years ago.  There is a chain back home in South Florida (Davie location), but we still get takeout here at least two times when we visit Orlando.Food is always great - we love the noodle bowls and Pao Pao chicken the most.The sushi combo is great as well - 2 half rolls and a California Roll.  Online order system does have issues once in a while, but convenient when it works.  Or just call ahead your order.Also, they have specials often, so make sure to check out their social media/emails for them."
12/31/2021,1,"I loved this restaurant for many years, but they stopped accommodating special requests. I've been ordering my chicken tempura rolls with avocado added for well over 3 years. Now they can't accommodate the request even though I pay extra every time happily! The manager even refused to cancel my order even though my request couldn't be honored. Literally ordered this week from them and had no issues but tonight with the customer service I won't be back. If you don't want to be bothered with a phone call with special requests maybe just add modifications to the menu options online then."
10/20/2020,4,"Bento is doing pick up services well during the pandemic. I've been a frequent customer of Bento. Some of my frequent picks are: taro bubble tea with pearls, shrimp tempura, Special Mexican roll and Pao Pao shrimp with Udon. -the pao pao shrimp with Udon can be quite heavy at times -the Special Mexican Roll is an Americanized sushi roll, with avocado and tempura shrimp -taro tea is good, though can be on the sweet side -have had the Thai tea and found it too sweet at timesThis place has easily become a community favorite and has been a family favorite for years. It might not be my go to place, though it caters to different tastes which makes it easy to enjoy."
8/15/2020,5,"We LOVE Bento! The amount of food you get for the price you pay is top notch. Great bang for your buck and quality food. Easy, quick and delicious!"
3/27/2018,3,"My coworkers and I were looking for something different for lunch today and decided to give Bento Cafe a try. We arrived a little after 12 and the restaurant was nearly empty. For lunch, I ordered a bowl with brown rice and Mongolian chicken. I also added miso soup. My food was served promptly. The miso soup was good, but the Mongolian chicken was super salty. Unfortunately my coworkers did not have as much luck with their meals being served promptly. 2/4 of us were served food 15 minutes after the rest of the party. Half of us were done eating before the others even got served. It was a little bit confusing since there were hardly any other patrons in the restaurant. Overall, I'd say my experience was average. I probably wouldn't return."
1/25/2022,2,"My son wanted to come here. The food was good....HOWEVER...Although my food came out first within 5 mins,  my son had to wait 30 MINUTES for his food because they forgot him! We went up to the counter twice to remind them and they would just say ok and still no food.. they were not understaffed and the place was not jammed pack... they even forgot the extra sauce I had to pay for and when my son's food finally came out there was no apology or reason given to why his food was served to him 30 minutes after ordering.. My son who is a server himself in 2 high end restaurants was disappointed on the service... We won't come here again. What a shame, the food was tasty"
6/18/2021,1,"Poor online order  management.. They missed the online order I placed.some one says they made incorrect order and prepared new again. No good order management. Handed over the food close to an hour after placing the order. No courtesy at all for causing the delay highlighting their delivery time can take up to an hour and saying they still met their delivery within window, very poor."
4/30/2017,5,"Bento Cafe was a spot my daughter likes so we popped in earlier today. What can I say, my daughter has excellent taste.  Even though its walk up Ordering off a laminated card, there is a touch of class to the place. The ambiance definitely gives it a vibe that is more than just a fast food experience. And the food was above that expectation as well. We got a rice with chicken bowl and a red curry shrimp with noodles, respectively.  Both were killer good.  Ad the accompanying egg rolls were top notch, fresh.  The boba teas we got were strawberry and I got a Matcha(just to be different).  They were solid.  The strawberry tasted like the milk left behind a bowl of fruit loops, but I think that's what they were going for.  We had no issues. The service was even good, with our guys giving good suggestions on what to get. Next time my daughter wants Bento, I will not hesitate to go."
9/27/2020,1,"I get it's Covid season, but you have one person managing the whole dining area and carry out orders? Ordered online 1hr before I picked it up and then waited another 45 min to be handed my bag of food that was just sitting on the shelf the whole time. Paid a $20 tip ahead of time which I regretted. Not mad at the poor guy managing the whole place, but whoever manages this place and thinks that is feasible for one person to manage the whole store when you have 10 people in the kitchen area should be fired. Also several items missing when I got home, sooo disappointing. So basically got robbed of time and money."
11/22/2017,4,"This establishment offers a great value, especially on restaurant row. The Service was excellent, the food was great and the portion size was more than adequate.  Plus the menu has tons of options.Update: November 22,2017- we continue to  eat here once every couple weeks.  The service has been a bit slow as of recent, especially when waiting to be seated.  The food continues to be reliably good. The variety is great, you could eat here weekly and not worry about eating the same thing repeatedly.  I have eastern numerous of the chicken dishes either as part of a bento bowl or a udon noodle bowl.  You can sub brown rice in the sushi or rice bowls for no additional charge.  The only thing I have had that I wouldn't order again was the pad Thai; it's just not the same flavor profile as a standard Thai restaurant."
6/9/2019,5,"I love going there for the sushi bento box mainly. I think it is a great price for the amount of sushi they give you. The fried avocado is the absolute best!!!! Love the little salad that comes with the sushi, the dressing is really good! Keep an eye on yelp as they have one free appetizer with an entree of $10 or more so we got dumplings which was crispy and yummy! Order in advance if you want it to go to avoid waiting quite a long time!"
1/12/2020,4,"This location introduced me to the bento chain. I've always had a good experience here! I recently visited with some friends from out of the country to introduce them to decently priced asian food, sushi and boba tea. The girl at the counter taking orders was nice and addressed any questions they had very well. We ordered , took our number and waited at the table for our food which came out very quickly and the young man who delivered was very kind and helpful. Overall, I loved this location but it gets busy and they should have more than one person taking orders when the line gets very long."
7/13/2020,4,"My friends love Bento, we usually order it thru food delivery services and I think it's okay. I ordered a bento box, which was a decent sized lunch portion. It came with a little salad (dressing they put on top was good,) some noodles, and a 4 piece of the 2 rolls you pick, and then a California roll. Like i said, it was good - and the presentation was good, Bento box is definitely the way to go for lunch. I love the rolls that have raw fish piled on top so I think I was thinking the signature rolls would be more of that when I was reading the menu... something more dense. But I'm definitely going to be more adventurous next time and order a full signature roll to try out something new. I will be trying again."
11/21/2018,3,"There was no salad or boba tea available on 11/20/2018 :( I've never been to Bento so this was a sad thing to know coming in. Our server for the night was Jonathan. Very sweet, kind and patient! His service was outstanding. Always checking on my party of two. 5 stars for service. We came in so hungry! We ordered dragon, kawaii, philly and another roll I cannot remember. The food was only okay. A simple ""meh."" I didn't really like their selection on the menu. I think I'm more used to seeing more options and sashimi available. I don't think I'll be back soon but it's worth a try to anyone else out there! Don't knock it till you try it. Unfortunately, I'm knockin this one out."
2/25/2020,4,"Bento is the chipotle of sushi.  Always a solid choice and you won't break the bank.  Quick, fast and to the point.  Sushi was delicious.  They could however use better rice, as the one we received easily breaks apart and caused a mess... happy hour 3pm-6pm.  Buy 2 rolls and get one free, also BOGO beer.."
11/9/2018,1,"Tried to give them business, called to put in to go order. But was told they were about to close and they don't take to-go order with 20 mins before closing.  Smh"
1/6/2019,4,"I always enjoy a bento box and this one did not disappoint for the variety and amount of food provided in the box.I did the box with brown rice and katsu chicken.  It also comes with some string beans in a vinaigrette type sauce, salad with some good ginger dressing, and some lo mein noodles.  It was a lot more food than I would typically expect in a box (normally I have seen noodles or rice).Our table also shared some veggie spring rolls, pork egg rolls, and pork dumplings.   Everything came out hot, fresh, and fast.I am looking forward to coming back in for another box."
9/10/2020,5,Amazing food! Amazing service! I order my food at peak rush time (5pm) and yet they still had my food ready in less than 15 minutes. I go in to pick up my order and was treated by the nicest staff! They had SO MANY mobile orders and were extremely busy but still find the time to smile and give me great customer service.
5/8/2019,5,"Cute restaurant, staff was really friendly and explained any questions we had about the menu. Food was really good! It was our first lunch in Florida and was definitely not disappointed. I wish we had one of these locations where I was, but when we make another trip we will definitely visit this place again!"
8/6/2020,5,"I ordered delivery and it was surprisingly good. A little overpriced but I wanted to try it out. The rice bowl had too many onions and peppers and not enough meat but overall it was good. The pork egg rolls were good, I had them with the sweet chili sauce which is tasty. Milk tea had it with boba, typical milk tea, nothing special. And the kimchi was good :)"
6/26/2020,5,"We love bento!!!  We order all the time from this location, food is always great. Denice the manger is best !! I can not rave more about her we had a problem with our order and she made sure to go above and beyond to make sure it was taken care of! What a great team leader! Thank you for being so kind and professional."
7/11/2018,5,"Tammy was right - those krab wontons were a delight.  They were perfectly fried, came with a great dipping sauce, and didn't have too much cream cheese filling.  Also, this round I had the sushi 'bento' box which is great because it is easy to customize.  With our table of 4, we were all able to try different rolls - which was a perfect plan."
2/15/2019,5,"I have been here numerous times and it is one of my fave go-to restaurants due to the very relaxed atmosphere and no fuss food. There are so many options for any of my plant-based friends. Yesterday when I went however, I was blown away by their services. Yesterday was Valentine's Day and I got there around 8:00; there was no ridiculous line or wait time. It was AMAZING! It's a great place to host big dinners (I did that for my undergrad and grad school family dinner). Plus it makes a great chill date night; especially if you order the peach sake, SOOOO GOOD! PS: you must try the spicy cream at least once!!"
6/25/2020,5,"Delicious! Would order again! We ordered a Mongolian noodle bowl, a sweet and sour pineapple bowl, a crunch roll, spring rolls, and a side salad. The bowls were plentiful and lots of veggies! The order was delivered quickly and with utensils/napkins. Again, delicious!!"
3/15/2018,5,"So happy to see another Bento Cafe!!!  Coming from Gainesville, Bento was always one of my regular spots.  When I saw there was one here in Orlando (by the same owners) I had to continue the tradition.  They have a few proteins to choose from prepared a variety of different ways as well as a great sushi menu.  You can get your protein in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box that comes with various sides like rice, noodles, green beans, and a small cake.  They also offer sushi/poke bowls that are delicious! The atmosphere is always really great and the staff are super friendly.  Oh, and I could not forget the boba tea!  I always go for the Royale (coffee and almond) milk tea that I've been getting since college.  This location is just as good as the Gainesville ones and I'm glad to see they decided to expand down here."
10/27/2018,4,"A great casual restaurant for lunch and dinner. They serve sushi rolls, poke bowls and these customizable rice/noodle bowls or bento boxes. They also have thai iced teas and other boba/milk tea drinks which is always a plus for me. I've come here for both lunch and dinner. The restaurant is pretty spacious so they can accommodate groups if you have one. For lunch one time, my company came with 12 of us and they were able to get us seated pretty quickly and cater to our large party. They do get pretty packed though so there might be a slight wait at times but that's a good sign because the food is good! I usually get the bento boxes because I like a little bit of everything. It comes with a scoop of rice (you can request for brown rice at no extra charge), some Lo mein noodles, a side of string beans, a salad, and an entree of your choosing. I had the sriracha garlic shrimp and the curry katsu and both were delicious. It also comes with these fried wonton chips drizzled in condensed milk so it's a legit full meal. I also always get the jasmine milk tea because why not? It's your standard milk tea, not bad and not amazing, just good enough to satisfy your craving. My friends have ordered the sushi and  they enjoyed that too. Everyone I come with is usually pretty satisfied so I definitely recommend this place! It's a regular for most of us. The service has been good the last couple of times I've been here as well. They also do takeout orders which you can pick up at the register if you don't want to dine in the restaurant. Free parking in the lot but it gets packed sometimes since it's in a plaza with multiple restaurants."
6/10/2018,3,"3.5/5I think this place is pretty good, definitely for the price point it's up there in value. Unfortunately my table had a couple of disappointments that prevented me from giving this a 4 star.I had the build-a-poke, which came with a wide variety of choices for proteins, additions, toppings, and sauces. For $11 or something around there, the poke was excellent. The portions were huge, and the fish was high quality and good taste.To finish my meal up I had the lychee boba tea, which was also well done.Most of my friends ordered bento boxes, and their experience ranged from really good to really terrible. The katsu in particular had criticisms of it being extremely dry and hard to eat, and the ""creamy"" chicken was anything but.Service was not the best. After our orders were taken, the server never came back to us to ensure water was filled, and rarely come back overall.I'll probably consider other Japanese places next time I'm in Orlando, but wouldn't say no to returning if needed."
5/7/2020,5,"Picked up lunch today, general tso's chicken bento box,excellent choice, comes with main dish, salad lo mein and green beans.  All items were fresh and tasted great.  Excellent lunch choice"
2/5/2021,5,"We ordered the sushi combo box and an order of krab wontons to share between two of us. There was enough food and it was very tasty!  Cali, Mt. Fuji, and the Mex roll--yum! Oh, and boba tea was great!  Mango popping in slush and milk tea with lychee popping. Perfect!"
10/1/2020,1,I ordered from Bentos through Doordash. When I placed the order it said 40 min delivery time. It kept getting pushed back in 15 min. Increments by the restaurant until it was 2 hours late. Doordash offered to comp the meal and provide a credit. It was supposed to be 10 more min. So that seemed fair. After 3 hours I called Doordash and they called Bentos for a status update. Bentos said they can't complete the order because they were getting ready to close.  So 3 hour delay and no food. I am really disappointed in the poor customer service.
9/25/2018,1,"This place isn't as good as 4 years ago. I've been going to Bentos for 8 years now, and these past few times have been disappointing. Today I gave it one more shot, and I'm done. I won't be coming here, and many of my close friends who were regulars have stopped going for months now. The food isn't good (it's extremely unhealthy and heavy), I actually had an upset stomach right after. The service has gone down; the waitress I had today was SO RUDE, and hard to communicate with. It's as if she went out of their way to be rude to a random person. Who does that?!The prices have gone up but the experience has gone down. There is no longer silverware (forks and knives), no lemons for your water and the food was presented just ok."
6/17/2019,1,"Vegans Beware!!!I have never in my life been to a less vegan-friendly Asian restaurant chain!!! First, they don't even have a comprehensive allergen guide since it doesn't contain anything about dairy allergies; second, the guide they do have is kept behind the counter where customers can't see and is not available on the website at all; third, the staff are completely ignorant about what ingredients go into the food they're serving.It was actually impossible for me to find out the ingredients for several of their sauces ""because the kitchen manager wasn't there"" right then. I was told their orange sauce (?!) and many of their other sauces weren't vegetarian because they contained fish sauce, and was shown the actual packaging for the base for ALL their curries which has DAIRY in it -- so all the people who have posted saying that their curry is vegan have either been LIED TO or have asked employees who just don't care enough to check.Out of their 20+ sauce options, the staff was only able to verify 3 as vegan, 2 of which were too spicy for my family. And one of the employees actually said that lots of ""authentic"" Asian sauces contained fish sauce -- you know what authentic Thai curry does NOT include? DAIRY!!! And I've never encountered an orange sauce with fish sauce in it before. I guess now I understand why they don't have their allergen menu anywhere customers can find it -- because they're ashamed of their pathetic vegan options, or if they aren't they really should be!"
12/10/2017,4,"The restaurant is located inside a strip mall, so we had a little trouble finding it  but we are glad we did. We ordered take out. Service was fast and friendly. We were unfamiliar with the menu and the cashier was patient with us. We had a poke bowl, a pad thai, and a bento box. All the food was fresh and tasted very good.  The pad thai was probably the only dish that I was a little disappointed in, since it only seemed to be loaded with noodles and not much else. We were offered water while we waited, and food was ready in an amazingly short time. Overall great experience, particularly considering this is a chain restaurant."
8/19/2018,5,"I came here based on a friend's recommendation, and I'm glad I did! We were able to be seated right away on a Sunday evening. Everything we ordered was really fresh and tasty! I will definitely be coming back!"
2/23/2020,5,"This place is a favorite of mine and go to spots, I can always try a new dish and never be disappointed. Always get a bento box and is worth the price. My favorites are the Beef Bulgogi and the Chicken Red Curry."
6/27/2019,4,"Never disappointed. It's bentos. Anything on the menu is delightful, sushi, a bento box, bowl..  plus they have so many things to toss your meats in. Wish there were more convenient locations instead on in the middle of downtown or in the middle of I drive madness. But I understand, location location location."
9/7/2018,4,"One of our go-to once a week dining spots.  Spicy tuna bowl, chicken with yellow curry bento box and Sushi...Kua'i roll is our usual order!  Oh wait...forgot the Katsu chicken and boba milk tea.  Service can be a hit or miss during peak hours. We usually order from the to-go order line and sit at the sushi bar for immediate seating. Hardly anyone sits at the sushi bar unless it's extremely busy.  Servers are consistently friendly.  With any bento box you get your choice of the main entree plus rice, noodles, ginger salad, fried green beans, wonton chips with a sweet sauce.  Yellow curry chicken was delicious!  The tuna bowl was delicious as well.  Fish was fresh and abundant.  Katsu chicken is tasty-meat tender and outside crisped. Try the Boba milk teas...there are many varieties.  Love the Jasmine, Taro and regular milk tea!  Make sure you get your boba tea frequency punch card!"
8/22/2020,3,"SO Disappointed with this once favorite quick lunch spot! Although the service was ok.... and admits the COVID restrictions, we decidedly sit dine in... the reason I leave this review is entirely the fact that they had 0 working bathrooms. When I alerted the waitress that there were SIGNS that said they were out of order. She feigned surprise, walked away for a total of 30seconds to confirm my statement. When I said ""are you serious!?"" Which is my god given human right reaction, to the fact that there is no working plumbing. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Aside from that fact that she was rude and did not offer any solutions, they continued to take orders at the door KNOWING there were absolutely NO working toilets. As a restaurant it is illegal to have dine in customers without working restrooms, and the fact that they continued to sit people regardless of the fact, that if someone wanted to use the restroom after a long day at the parks, or a long drive there, or even a preganant woman... there was nothing available, but the hope adjacent restaurants wound allow service with out being a customer. I will no longer eat at Bento, and will no longer recommend."
7/2/2018,5,"I love Bento! Visited the Dr. Phillips location (I usually go downtown since I live downtown) but the parking here is a lot easier. The service was great as always, and I love the atmosphere! You can be seated at a table or at the ""sushi bar"" and watch them put together your roll, which is pretty cool. I ordered my favorite, Special Mexican roll. I get it every time!! Great sushi spot for a reasonable price and even better quality!"
12/2/2019,5,"Wheny here on a double date with friends, the food was amazing we all got something different. Everything tasted great there was plenty of food, you could easily make two meals out of your entree.I had the yellow curry with chicken and rice, it was really delicious had great flavor had some heat but wasn't overwhelmingly hot. Definitely go back again!"
6/3/2018,5,I swear i love this place! The food is always so fresh and tasty and the people have the best customer service ever!
1/15/2018,5,"Came here for a birthday and ordered the spicy cream chicken which was pretty good. The portion size is really filling, enough to share in my opinion. Comes with green beans and red/green peppers. Also got the lychee sake was also really good! Light and refreshing. We also got a poke bowl, which was really good! It was salmon, white rice, avocado, seaweed salad and furikake. Everything was fresh anParking was readily available with plenty of space. Probably my favorite thing about our visit was our waiter, Alexander. Very thorough and just an all around nice guy that didn't have a problem getting us something when we needed. The wait isn't too bad on the weekends but can get kind of long. This location differs from the one by UCF, which is kind of in and out versus this location is more of a sit down."
12/8/2017,1,"Quality of food and service have decreased as Bento has gained popularity. My holy grail entrees have always been the Neo Tokyo Kawaii roll (tuna, krab delite, cucumber, avocado, drizzled with sweet chili sauce) which is now discontinued and the udon tofu curry katsu noodle bowl. So I allow myself one cheat meal a week and I was looking forward to my udon tofu curry katsu noodle bowl. Imagine my disappointment when the server brings out a large bowl and a few strands of udon noodles with 10 string beans. Remember this is my holy grail meal that I order every time I come here so I'm familiar with the portion sizes. I mentioned my observation to the waiter and he offered to take my bowl to the back of the kitchen and then brings it back and apologizes. For an additional charge the cooks can open and another pack of udon noodles to place in my bowl. They only use one pack of udon noodles. Mistake number one was letting the waiter take my bowl away and return it to me the ""same."" If you've worked in the restaurant industry you know what may or may not happens when a customer complains. At this point I was starving and dug into my miniscule bowl ignoring any warnings my germaphobic intuition may be alerting me.  My colleague who always reluctantly accompanies me to Bentos offers to share his food with me. He also observed the dearth in portion size compared to the previous visits. He also kindly remind me that he did not want to eat here because of his previous disappointments at this location but came at my insistence. Service is a work in process. My colleague ordered water with no ice for me. Water arrives with ice. No big deal. Ice will melt and turn into water. When ordering we requested separate checks. My colleague requested for a fork when ordering appetizers since he can't use chopsticks. His appetizers arrived and he used his hands to eat them. I get up and walk to the soda machines to get him a fork. The first fork that I fished out had  debris stuck to it. I placed it onto the counter and grabbed a second fork that looked cleaner. *cringe* After the appetizers were finished. A fork was provided to him along with our entrees. A different server comes and offers to clear the remaining plates while we were eating our entrees. She took one plate. ONE. Ignoring the several empty plates on the table.When the check came it was not separated. We asked again for separate checks to pay for our respective meals. Check came back and it was split in half evenly. Whatever. We sign the receipts and leave.Our server was very sweet and nice. He seemed new and and I wish the best for him.At this point, this was the final nail in the coffin and I'll be avoiding any future visits to this location. I left feeling so hungry from the disappointing portions."
6/9/2017,5,"Benton has been sitting in my bookmarks for too long. Mom and I finally took the leap and stopped in for lunch and I am so glad we did. I am a huge sushi fan and they have it in spades. I chose the Sushi Box which includes an 8 piece Californai Roll, then I chose a 4 piece Special Mexican Roll and a 4 piece Alaskan. If you check in on Yelp there is a great coupon you can use to get a free appetizer with any $10 purchase so we ordered the Pork Egg rolls. Mom ordered a Sesame Chicken rice bowl with brown rice and she chose a drink from the refridgerator while I chose an iced tea. After ordering we were given a number and then found a seat. Since Mom has a walker one of the servers offered to remove a chair from our table so that her walker had a space, which was very nice. We received our egg rolls first. They were crispy and flavor ful. They were served with a tasty sweet and sour sauce which I really enjoyed. When my sushi box arrived I was so excited. I didn't know where to start. So I started with the Alaskan roll. It contained krab, smoked salmon, avocado and masago. Wow, loved the smokey flavor, not what I was expecting. Already loving this place and it just uped my feelings. Now I moved onto the California, filled with krab, avocado, cucumber and masago. Pretty typical of other California rolls but the freshness of the ingredients really shined through. My final roll was the Special Mexican and was my absolute favorite. Tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, steamed shrimp, spicy mayo and eel sauce. Before digging in one of the servers stopped by to check on us and he recommended I try the white sauce with my roll and so I happily agreed and I am so glad I did. This added an additional zip to the already dynamic flavor. Of the 3 rolls, this was my favorite. From beginning to end, we both loved our meals. We look forward to returning and trying more menu items. I especially look forward to try a bubble tea.Happy dining!!!"
6/7/2017,5,"I came here for the first time today, meeting up with friends for an impromptu lunch date. I was quite impressed with the location, seating and overall dining experience. Conveniently located on ""Restaurant Row"", which is West Sand Lake Road, Bento Cafe offers you a yummy sushi experience that won't break the bank. You order at the counter, pay and are given a numbered table flag. Food is delivered to your table. Menu is fairly varied, with an average of 8-10 dining options in the form of rolls, noodles, rice, poke bowls and some appetizers. Beverages are also decently varied. Boba tea is available, as are fountain drinks, some beers and Japanese sodas in the cooler, among others. Prices are good starting around $5-6 for appetizers and some of the rolls.Seating is a plenty, and there are Happy Hour specials!I say check them out. And order a Kawai Roll. You'll thank me later!!!!"
6/16/2017,1,"I used to always order from the downtown location for Bento Cafe using Uber Eats. I fell in love with the food instantly. I recently moved to this side of town and I was extremely excited to find one 15 minutes away on Sand Lake. I came with a few friends along with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I ordered about $50 worth of food and waited a considerable amount of time for it all to come out. When it came out, I wanted to request a little more soy sauce and ginger. A girl called out ""I'll be with you in a moment"" and proceeded to stand at the servers drink fill station with four other female employees while talking amongst each other while also looking at us occasionally. For five minutes. She never came back. Several different servers passed by us and also did not acknowledge our existence. After a while, we got annoyed and a server heard us talking about it and asked us what we were waiting for. I kindly asked for some soy sauce and ginger and he said sure. I then watched him go to the drink fill station and speak to the other employees that were talking. Five minutes pass and he gets up from his talk and grabs my stuff and sends me on my way. We took it to go and when we got home, I realized we had two full rolls missing from the bag. We called back and they asked if we lived nearby. We drove basically 30 minutes close to midnight for two full rolls that should've been in there in the first place. I feel that after all of this I shouldn't gotten more of a refund but nah. Nothing they could do about it, except offer 2 free rolls next visit. They brought out a binder of lists of guests who need things comped from past mistakes, and added us in.A thick binder. Unsure if I want to go back to this location and even redeem it."
7/1/2021,1,We arrived at 11:02.  Seven employees visibly present.  We ordered four sushi rolls.  As of 11:30 one roll has arrived to the table.  No plates.  No sauce.  When we approached one of the seven employees for plates and sauce we were told to ask someone else.  We will not be back.  Horrible service.  Can't tell you about the food..still haven't gotten telos remainder of our order.
6/16/2019,4,"Ordered a decent amount of food on UBER last night. Had a few people over and it was an easy solution for dinner. We had about 8 entrees some sushi and a kids meal and everything was perfect. Arrived hot, everything tasted great. Came with utensils and sauces. Definitely a great fix for an easy dinner without the hassle!"
6/1/2019,1,"Kids got food poisoning May 23rd, and several other neighbors after I started a blog.Very poorly handled by management.Filed a Fl dept of health complaint , they are investigating.Shall not go back there any time soon , eventhough we were regulars."
6/1/2020,1,"Just a quick note... togarashi (which is simply chili pepper flakes) now cost $1.00. In my opinion, that's ridiculous!!!!! Really? Just to add some spice to my edamame. I wonder if they charge for salt and pepper?"
6/4/2020,5,"My fiance and I love Bentos. Coming from South Florida, this location was amazing. Great portions, amazing food and great staff. 10/10."
4/15/2017,2,"So, I had constant debates with myself if I should write this review or not because I normally take food over service but the last time we visited this location it was pretty bad. Pretty bad that I was on the verge of leaving but I was hungry so decided to wait some more. We arrived on a Friday evening, gave us a 20 min wait for 4. We sat down in ten so was under the impression that we would get out on a reasonable time. Waiter came, brought us water, took our orders. Now the issues start. We ordered an appetizer and some sushi rolls to share, 20 min came by, still nothing. In the meantime, our server never once visited us. I had to get up and find someone to get an update on our food. Main entrees arrived like 10 min later. Noticed that two of our orders were wrong, came with lo mein noodles instead of mini udon. Runner took it back to correct it. Update, server still hasn't visited the table at all. I had to get up and get utensils for the littles ones and refill our own drinks. Finally our food came and damn they 100% jipped us on our noddles. Came with like 10 noodles and they were the wrong ones. They were the huge udon noodles not the mini. I was so hungry by this time that I didn't care to send it back. I have picture for proof. It was so sad too cause my katsu chicken was so bomb today. After we finished eating, our server decided to bless us with his presence and brought the check without us asking. Noticed they didn't take the appetizer off since I used the check-in offer from Yelp. Told a server, not ours, cause he didn't stop by to pick it up in a timely matter. Server came back and said thanks! And returned our card. We open the checkbook to retrieve our card and leave a tip when we realize they hadn't even charged our card yet. At this point, I was completely over this experience and wanted to leave asap. Almost thought about doing a dine and dash since the server should have realized they didn't swipe our card before he said thanks. But decided against it and just went up the cashier to see if they can process our card. Go for lunch when they don't have ""servers."" This location should switch to the lunch way at night if they can't figure out how to run their business with servers."
8/21/2019,5,"Coming in not expecting to enjoy my meal, I was pleasantly surprised by the food, price, and staff. According to yelp Bento does not have very good rating so I never gave the one near UCF a try, thinking I would be disappointed. I really enjoyed my sushi here, and in comparison to other fast Asian restaurants, the sushi was very fresh and made when you order. The rice bowl my friend order was very tasty and even though it is not a fancy authentic Asian taste, you get the fast food Chinese taste you crave, but even more fresh. The portions here are very large as well, you really get what you pay for. Overall I would say that Bento is a great option if your looking for fast Asian food, but don't expect a sit down restaurant like Hawkers or Sushi pop."
5/5/2020,1,Manager did not honor the yelp check-in saying its no longer valid even though it's still active on the app-beware. The cashier James was super nice though!
6/7/2019,1,It would be nice if there was a sign that says please go to the cash register to order your meal... I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take my order.Then finally asked if someone could take my order and they said  - oh you have to Order at the cashiers ... above the cashier sign it says pitcher for orders to go... So I had no idea you were supposed to stay in there to order and in Restaurants order as well.By this time there  was a very long line.I asked to speak with a manager... and no manager came.Finally one of the service came to me and I like that you just said they hang a sign up that says the order here - and walked out and went to another sushi restaurant across the street Oh well.  Not a big deal... just was a bit frustrating
2/17/2017,4,"Yuummmm, everytime I eat at Bento I think of my college days at UF. I don't think this location can ever compare to my Gainesville student struggle experience but it comes rather close with giving me the right type of spice and sushi to fulfill my bento cravings. My favorite entre is the curry katsu noodle bowl, I love the level of spiciness the sauch has and usually get extra. I also like their milk teas with boba, they have a punch card so if you drink milk tea often you'll eventually get a free one. My favorite rolls are usually all their cooked sushi options (Im kinda allergic to raw fish) they have all been satisfying.Notes-Check in on yelp and get a free appetizer if you spend more then $10.-Ask for milk tea punch card if you purchase them often.-Lunch time line is usually crazy long, enjoy during their less busy hours or order take out -Their food is filling and you get large portion sizes, I have never left feeling hungry-Enjoy!"
10/16/2020,2,"Waiting for over an hour for my ""25 min"" pickup and they forgot half my order. I understand its Friday but simply adjust pickup times to accurately reflect. Half of my order will be cold by the time I finally get the other part of my order."
4/12/2019,4,"Their taro milk tea is the brown version not purple version. I'm used to purple taro milk tea where the best way to describe it is 'the milk left after eating fruity cereal' but this brown version is more like 'the milk left after eating chocolate cereal with a mild coffee flavor'? Not fruity at all to me. It wasn't as bad as other places that I've been given the brown version, this one was still sweet, creamy and tasty but just didn't hit the spot for me on the taro flavor I was looking forward to.I enjoyed a mini udon bowl with steak and garlic broccoli! Very delicious, the portion size for me was very filling with still some left over"
1/29/2020,4,"Super yummy,fairly cheap, and quick go-to spot for Asian food! Plenty of different sushi, bento boxes, and bowls to chose from! Rice bowls are huge and I always end up taking most of it home with me but who doesn't love leftovers! My only complaint would be the staff from time to time. I've had my order messed up several times which in my case (allergy) is a huge mistake. However, they have always kindly fixed my order."
3/31/2015,4,"My boyfriend and all of friends would rate this restaurant as a solid 5 stars. I on the other hand would rate this restaurant as a solid 4 stars. The food is always consistent. For the most part, I always stick to the same dish - udon stir fry noodle bowl with chicken. Over the weekend, I tried ordering this dish with pork but for some reason they couldn't make it that way. I've tried other things such as: wakame salad, krab cheese wontons, california roll, and mongolian beef. My boyfriend on the other hand typically orders the crunch roll and curry katsu with pork. Overall, the food is pretty good and the portions are nice. They offer happy hour Monday - Friday from 4pm - 7pm. For the happy hour - if you buy 2 rolls you get one free. If you check into Yelp while dining, you get a free appetizer (anything from the starters & sides). Overall, the prices are reasonably priced. I'm not really sure why this restaurant doesn't have better reviews. I'm a fan (hence the 4 stars) but it's not as good as it gets."
6/6/2021,1,"The sushi was okayish, but the service was horrible. The waitress and waiter serving us were just tossing the plates in the middle of the table and walking off. The restrooms were very dirty, too."
5/23/2021,3,"Food always comes out good at this location but the customer service is poor half the time and could definitely be improved. I am a loyal customer and I usually do online order and pickup. When I stopped by today to pick up my order, the employees weren't attentive that I was standing at the front for a good 2-3 minutes, discussing a previous order. When they finally greeted me I told them I had a pickup order and the young lady told me my order was t ready yet, which was fine. I then waited 30 minutes after that and saw multiple online orders go out so I went to the counter myself again and asked if my order was ready because I had ordered about an hour ago and come to find out it had been sitting there for lord knows how long. I would've appreciated if the young lady who checked on my order was more attentive on the status of it and handed it out when it was ready. The resultant wasn't busy at all and there were only a few dine in and take out orders so for that mistake to happen is irritating. When the restaurant is busy how much more are they not paying attention to the customers?"
3/6/2019,2,"I'm a huge Bento dan - but not a big fan of it now being all quick service. It was a terrible experience vs. eating in. So sad my favorite ""restaurant"" no longer exists!"
2/1/2020,1,"Came here for dinner with 2 others and all of us recieved almost 0 sauce on our meals, went and asked for a little extra sauce and their employee Brandi was extremely rude. Been living in the area my whole life going here, will be sure to never go back. Thanks Brandi."
11/11/2016,5,"Always a great lunch place!!!!  Food is delicious and very affordable! Love the fact that they are very quick with preparing the meals so it's great for a 30min lunch break! Also, there's a Yelp check-in free appetizer if you spend $10 or more which is a big plus!"
12/14/2018,5,"I love this cute little cafe. Dropped in wanting sushi but quickly changed it up with the big selection. I ordered noodles with teriyaki chicken bowl. It was delicious and a large quantity. Definitely didn't leave hungry. They had pad Thai, sushi, rice and noodle bowls, regular sushi and then sides and add ons."
10/12/2016,3,"I enjoyed my veggie spring rolls and bento box! :) The food is definitely fresh! The service was really good too, and the food came out at a fast pace, which was nice. Surprisingly the food wasn't as hot temperature wise as I would have liked, but overall the food tasted good! The ambiance is nice and has a cozy feel, yet the restaurant space and layout is large enough to accommodate everyone in every corner of the room. There is a TV screen as well for anyone who wants to be entertained."
1/7/2018,3,"Friendly staff, LOTS of different options and plus a bubble milk tea option. We had pork grilled cajun rice bowl and half florida roll, with the lava roll. We also ordered green tea lychee with bubble and regular milk tea with bubble. Teas were pretty good.  Rice bowl was good too. I have to say, the sushi was a bit disappointing, rice has no taste, the lava combination with krab on top wasnt a hit. It wasn't flavorful enough. The sushi was a bit soggy.. other than the sushi the rest was good"
1/5/2020,1,"Asked for a side of sauce with my food, asked multiple times for the sauce I asked for with my order took 15 minutes to get the sauce I asked for. Food was cold by that time, then I asked for another sauce because the container was half full and it was a problem. Sorry but I just paid 12 dollars for my food sauce shouldn't be a problem if I ask for another one."
1/24/2020,5,Ordered delivery from here to our hotel last night. Everything was delicious and packaged well.
10/20/2016,5,"I've been to this place a couple of times, and have only had great experiences! I've had the vegetable stir fry, pad thai with noodles, and an avocado sushi roll.The atmosphere is modern and clean. The restaurant can get a bit noisy. The service is super quick as well! There is usually a line out the door when I've gone, so be prepared for that. Their tofu isn't mushy or gross, which is a huge plus for vegetarians."
1/16/2017,3,"Lots of items on the menu to choose from: Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, etc. Asian fushion for sure. I came here few times and every time was ok. Food flavor is forgettable, nothing that stood up to me. I tried their sushi few times and they were just mediocre. I mean I could eat them, but they taste pretty bland to me and I can never remember what I had for a meal afterwards! It never left an impression on me. Even their Thai or Chinese dishes were mediocre, I'd rather go to a Thai place to have a more authentic dish. It's a great place to hang out with coworkers."
2/11/2020,2,"This is a very popular spot for college students and the younger crowd. We ordered the special mex roll, and the Tuesday teriyaki bowl deal as well as the bogo Tuesday boba tea. We were in the waiting area for a solid 20 minutes just looking at the menu because there were so many options to choose from! When we arrived there was no crowd and a few minutes later there was a long line. When at the counter we encountered a very rude employee who at first ignored us at the register, and then was rude as we ordered. The Mexican roll was good, though certainly not one of the better sushi places I've had. The teriyaki bowl was terrible, the chicken was dry, and the rice bland. For boba tea I got the Thai tea with strawberry popping boba which I loved, and mango milk tea with regular boba which was awful, i changed it and asked for a suggestion which was the coconut milk tea mixed with the vanilla mixed tea and it wasn't so good either. The to go boxes were directly next to the trash can less then 4 inches away and some were upside down next to the trash can! When I asked for a water cup the employees seemed overwhelmed as they all mentioned how busy it was. At the time I would say it was busy, yet almost nobody was seated as most were to go orders. Overall the food was average to mediocre, and the service was god awful."
4/6/2017,4,"Great restaurant for a fast healthy meal. Their miso soup is delicious ! I like that you can order your own sushi roll with any proteins and other adding.its very affordable to eat here! There are a lot of vegetarian options too, Tofu is good and available for any if their bowls or bento box"
1/5/2020,1,"This bento is inferior to all the other bentos I've been to. The service is slow, they bring your food out of order and they are extremely stingy about their sauces. If I ordered a full plate of food, one sauce container filed only half way is NOT enough for my $12 plate of food. I am a paying customer and should not feel like a delinquent when I ask for more sauce. The lady even looked in my Togo bag when I asked her for more sauce to check if I already had some. On top of the fact that I had to go out of my way to ask for it twice, because they forgot. Oh, and they brought my soup like 15 mins after my food had gotten here and I was already full. Soup should've been the first thing out."
6/22/2016,5,"I cannot begin to explain how much I love Bento! For years it has been my go to sushi restaurant and I just wished I lived closer to it. It's located in Dr. Phillips and is a little on the small size. It's a quiet, intimate restaurant but on the relaxed side. There are also tables outside if the inside is packed and they have take out available as well. The staff is always really friendly and attentive. In the afternoons, you can order at the counter and then they will bring the food to you. In the evenings, it's a full service restaurant.My first love here is the Boba tea! I cannot go here without ordering one. They have tons of flavors but I'm perfectly content with the plain milk flavor. My next love is the sushi. Their noodle bowls always look so good but I always end up with sushi and sashimi. My favorite is the Special Mexican Roll. My husband loves their O Town Roll. Their sashimi plates are huge! Their fish is always fresh! This trip we used the Yelp coupon for a free appetizer when you check in. We got the pork dumplings but someone made a mistake and brought us the chicken dumplings too. They were super hot and we preferred the pork but I wasn't in love. For dinner I tried something new! The spicy tuna don sashimi bowl was to die for! Tons and tons of tuna in a bed of rice with avocado and cucumber! I have a new love! It will definitely be hard to pick something to eat now that I have multiple favorites!"
12/9/2019,1,"Went 2 times, 1st time forgot spicy mayo for poke bowl and sushi. 2nd time was a 43min wait for a pickup order. Nobody was in the restaurant while the sushi chefs stood there and talked, finally got up and said is my order ready after 25min.  Tried giving this location the benefit of the doubt, but no dice. I won't be back."
2/1/2017,5,Love the food here. Looks like happy hour will be my next attempt. Lots of choices and something for everyone
1/28/2017,4,"I used to go to bentos when I lived in Gainesville.  It was one of my go to restaurants. When I saw it was in Orlando as well, I had to go! They have locations in Tallahassee and Jacksonville as well.  I got the bento box and as always it was great! The green beans and ginger salad are really good.  You really can't go wrong but I usually get tofu szchewan or tofu hunan.  They have excellent boba teas as well.  I got the Thai tea with popping mango boba and my friend got the milk tea smoothie. We both loved it!! The service is great and the staff is very friendly.  This location has ample parking and there is outdoor seating options as well.  I was highly recommended eating here for a quick asian meal!! Also, doubt forget to use the check in deal- I got garlic edamame ( super yum!)"
4/20/2017,5,"Love this place. Low key with reasonable prices and free wifi. Good place to grab lunch and do some work or relax. Menu has a lot of variety, including rice bowls, noodle bowls, and bento  boxes (duh!). All the typical Asian favorites too - pad Thai, bulgolgi, teriyaki, katsu, sushi rolls, and Boba tea. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."
3/6/2019,2,This food better be great. Took them an hour to fix a Grub Hub to go order for one person! Like seriously?! I'm pregnant and HANGRY it's not even peak lunch time! I'm also mad they have the driver waiting...tying up their money. Do better!Update: I apologize it was Door Dash. They can't possibly say they didn't have any long orders because i had to call twice. My driver just left there 5 or so minutes ago. I'm still waiting.
1/9/2017,4,"Food is great, service leaves something to be desired. Volcano roll is amazingggg comes with 10 peices. Sushi combo box for 10 bucks is a great deal. I went there for a birthday gathering my waiter forgot to put my meal into the order meaning while my entire party was eating i was waiting. When everyone was finished my dinner was finally brought out very unpleasant situation. After i expressed how i felt The manager very generously gave us $3 off our $80 check. Which in my opinion was insulting. Great place to get food to go not worth the Hassle of sitting and waiting hours for food."
7/18/2018,1,"Bento is officially bent-NO for me after my experience there today. Between the lack of customer service and bizarre mishaps, I truly would rather go elsewhere for ANY meal. Let me begin. 1. The line was literally out the door and they had one person handling in store orders and online orders. I honestly witnessed an Ubereats person waiting for over 20 minutes to then be told they didn't have the order because they didn't have power? If this is the case, there needs to be some communication here. Unprofessional. 2. By the time my friend and I got to the register and started to order...the person taking our order was snapping at us for items that were UNAVAILABLE due to ""no power""...for example udon noodles. Again, if this is the case, there's a way to say things and not to say things to customers. There were about 30+ people waiting behind us still at this point receiving the same customer service. 3. I paid for my meal on an employees personal cell phone. To the point that I could see their push notifications from different APPS on their phone as I was paying. That is very strange to me. There should be a plan in place if your systems are down.4. My friend and I basically enjoyed our meal in the dark because the power continued to go out multiple times. Listen....I know things happen, but the way the staff was acting was unacceptable. They were more concerned with fanning themselves with their menus due to the no AC then anything else taking place in the restaurant. 5. They finally decided they should close the restaurant and placed a handwritten note on the door saying ""SORRY WE'RE CLOSED"" in sharpie. It was honestly comical. Again....they should have closed as everything taking place was a train wreck...BUT...the note on the door could have been a little more descriptive and polite stating they were sorry for any inconvenience. I really could say more, but I think you get the point. When my friend and I left we looked around at the rest of the plaza and everyone else had power. Not sure what was going on but it was truly a hot mess. I can't even comment on the food because the saga of events truly made my meal unmemorable."
4/30/2020,5,"The best Sushi in town! They have great happy hour specials,  so make sure to check those out!"
3/23/2014,4,"I ordered delivery from Bento, so I can't comment on the atmosphere or service at the physical location.Bento has quite a mix of options - there's sushi, Thai curries, Korean BBQ bowls and even some Chinese options. That worried me a little - when a place tries to do everything, quality usually suffers. Fortunately, the sushi was pretty tasty and very fresh.I had the Golden Knight & Red Dragon rolls - pretty much slightly different variants on shrimp, crab & tuna combined. If you want a sauce (lets say sriracha...) it's going to run you $.50 to $1 extra. Otherwise, the prices were extremely fair - from $8-13 for the special or ""executive"" rolls. The presentation and knife cuts on the fish weren't the prettiest, but for delivery sushi who cares?Overall, I was really happy with Bento Café. The delivery min ($12) was reasonable, my order arrived about 15 minutes early & the driver was friendly and my food was really very good. I'd order again with no hesitation."
6/1/2018,4,My co workers love Bento!  It's right in the heart of Dr Phillips and is near I-drive.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  Try a strawberry milk tea with boba (~$4) and the spicy creamy chicken with white or brown rice (~$8).  You can get noodles or sushi too.  Order ahead so you don't have to wait in the long lines.
2/27/2020,3,It really shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to make sushi bento boxes when the restaurant was empty when we got here.  Food seems good - I haven't received mine yet - 32 minutes of waiting.
10/2/2016,4,Always come here on my first night in Orlando. Love it. Always have a bento box as well as a spider roll and an appy. Loving the new Tokyo roll. And a nice cold Sapporo. Try it next time in town. I've fallen for the sushi combo bento box. Go for the Mt Fuji roll and the rainbow roll. Great.
3/18/2020,5,"If I could give this place enough stars! I live in the same plaza and eat here at least once a well! Love their poke bowls, rolls and chicken!"
4/22/2018,5,I always get my spicy cream chicken today I decided to do a rice bowl instead of a bento box!  The food tasted fresh I was able to finish it all!  Since we came in around 10pm we had to order our food first and hen seat versus getting seated.  Downtown Orlando has this concept I like it!   Our food came out pretty fast.
10/26/2016,5,"Bento Cafe has been one of my favorite Asian quick service/table service restaurants in Orlando for many years now. It was a usual stop for me with friends or solo when I was deeply craving sushi. I just went back the other day for the first time since moving back to Orlando to indulge in some Sunday sushi takeout. They have not lost their touch.Lunch at Bento is quick service style. You order at the counter, you get a number, and a friendly staff member will bring you your food. In the evenings for dinner though they do full-service. I like that mix where lunch is a faster go than in the evenings where I would prefer to sit down and have a longer chat with family or friends. Two menus are available. You've got your sushi menu with some awesome weekday lunch specials and then your regular bento box entree menu. I can honestly say I've tried a range of things at Bento and loved all of them. A dear friend of mine (shout out to Ada C.!) is a big bubble tea fan here. She couldn't get enough of that stuff. As a matter of fact, she was the one that introduced me to Bento Cafe. All in all what I mean to say is Bento is an awesome lunch spot."
2/14/2020,5,"I love this place! They have so many options it's insane! I typically order a rice bowl that I design. I'm a vegan and the tofu here is to DIE for. I don't know what they do, how they do it, but it's incredible. Some of the best tofu I've had. The staff is always friendly, polite, and hard working. When they are busy, they try their absolute best to make sure everyone is happy. This place is always a go to for me for food quality, quantity, and the staff!"
3/12/2020,5,I really like the Poke regular bowl. The steamed shrimp and salmon were perfect. Try the sushi rolls with Spicy Mayo it is the best combination. Pretty nice presentation.
10/26/2016,5,"Despite the name I've never had a Bento Box at Bento Cafe. I love the sushi at Bento.  My favorite is the TNT roll which elevates and clarifies the flavors of the spicy tuna roll.  The flacors are crisp and jolting.  I also enjoy the crispy dumplings which are served with an amazing sipping sauce--no boring soiy ginger here--this sauce is firey and spicy and tangy--it gives me life!The service at Bento is always too slow for an impatient person like me, so I typically call ahead and pick up my order.  The decor is modern, dark, clean lines, and spacious.  They have a few locations around the city, but not enough for my tastes!"
4/17/2020,5,"Today my daughter ordered chicken tariyaki for me and it was delicious, love the way the food was placed, it was very presentable, Thank You bento, my wife and I, dont eat asian food just any where, but after enjoy your food, i will continue to order from you folks thank you again bento in margaritavile, in Kissimmee, Fla"
11/25/2018,4,"Casual style dining were you order at the front, sit down, and food is brought to your table. There are plenty of hot dishes sushi, and poke. We ordered the build your own poke, and the flying dragon roll. The fish in the poke (spicy tuna and spicy salmon) as extremely fresh. This place was very busy the entire time we were there on Saturday around 12, which is good helping confirm fresh food. I appreciated that the had toppings such as avocado and cream cheese, since a lot of poke I've had charge extra for avocado, and I haven't seen any that offer cream cheese. I wanted to try the boba tea, but we way too full. We definitely enjoyed the food here, the service was really friendly, and there also lots of parking. I definitely recommend this place, and I would  come back"
9/25/2018,4,"I wouldn't say the food is high quality but they have a great variety of Asian foods. They have noodles, sushi, and rice bowls. If you check in you also get a free appetizer! We had a pretty large party come in, and everyone left with a full belly. Every time I go to Florida, I have been back to Bento for the spicy cream pao pao. The portions are generous, if you are looking for smaller portions they have mini poke bowls."
2/8/2016,4,"This place makes me nostalgic for my UF undergrad life... But you're not here to read about that. The sushi is good but not great, the Cantonese pork chop bento box is generously-sized, and the staff is friendly and welcoming. They recently did away with table service but this is still a great place for a fast lunch or dinner. Bonus: most of the food is really reasonably-priced!"
6/27/2014,3,"I pretty much grew up on Bento in Gainesville (original beginnings of this restaurant), so I was happy to hear that they were opening two locations in Orlando (where I am originally from).  The food quality is about the same but the prices are a little more expensive than Gainesville.  I did not enjoy the layout of the restaurant versus both Gainesville locations.This location is more of a wait-staff type restaurant, which is OK but the implementation here is not stellar.  I'm not sure why it took us 40 minutes to get our food, but that's a long time compared to the speediness of the Gainesville locations.  Needless to say, I like the food, but I would be hesitant to come back due to the slow implementation."
9/18/2016,5,"Just had an awesome dinner at Bento! Boyfriend got the lava, balihai and 151 rolls. All were so good. The 151 was a gorgeous presentation! The best I have ever seen anywhere and we eat a lot of sushi. I got the tuna salad bowl. Perfect combo of flavor from tuna, avocado, Wakame salad and ponzu sauce. So fresh and filling. We also started with the spicy edemame. Gotta love a free appetizer with Yelp check in! Nice kick if you like spicy. Service was also very friendly. Great dinner all around. We will be back for sure. Might be our new fav sushi place!"
5/25/2016,4,"Bento is always a must to visit here when in the Orlando area.. Especially when your boyfriend is obsessed with the Spicy Cream. ...it is hard to find disappointing though. I've eaten at their Gainesville locations as well. All with friendly and quick service. Almost every dish I've tried has been very good. All of their prices range between $8-15, but I think it's all affordable for a night out. The sushi rolls are also worth mentioning and are either 8 or 10 pieces each for the same price range as mentioned above. We're pretty excited for their Davie location to open up!"
6/19/2018,4,"This is a great, counter service restaurant. The service is great and fast. I enjoyed my Mexican and Volcano rolls. The price is great. I'm glad they added pokè bowls into the menu."
3/13/2016,4,"This place is nice right in the middle of all the action in Orlando. They have a wide variety of options including sushi, rice bowls, and salads with sushi. I ordered the build your own salad. The prices are pretty good for what you can get. I got spicy salmon and pan seared tuna. The salad was a nice size with fresh vegetables. The service was kind of slow though especially if being a Saturday afternoon. That was my only complaint but otherwise this is a nice restaurant to come to for a healthy option."
5/28/2019,1,I got terrible food poisoning from eating here two days ago along with my brother and my mom. We ordered sushi and the lo mein and spicy cream chicken. I will absolutely never return here. I don't know what's up with their cleaning practices but I warned you guys.
5/27/2019,1,My girlfriend and I got terrible food poisoning from here.. puking non stop for 6 hours. Either salmonella or E. coli.... Do not eat here!!!!!
12/1/2015,4,"If you are looking for quick and casual Asian cuisine, Bento is your place. Yes, Pei Wei is just up the street but Bento's menu has a better assortment of Asian food and dishes feels more authentic. If only they had the fanciful Coca Cola machines...Menu highlights include Bento boxes, noddle bowls and rice bowls. They also have an extensive sushi menu. I'm not a fan of seafood so I'll just say they have tons of options.If you haven't tried Boba Teas, go for it! You only live once. My favorite is Taro."
11/13/2015,3,"The key word to remember when walking into Bento is ""variety"". They have an extensive menu with a sampling of noodle dishes, rice dishes, salads and of course sushi. Location wise, it is tucked in the same shopping center as Bar Louie right on Sandlake, which is a pretty good local for the area. We went with the basics of what you expect from a sushi bar and ordered sushi. They have a plethora of rolls and even a few specials that allow you a sampling of atleast 3 or 4 rolls, which is what I went with and glad I did. There were a lot of interesting house rolls, so I grabbed a few of those and went on about my day. Overall, the sushi quality was good, it was not spectacular and was far from disappointing. I would stop by and grab some rolls at Bento again when in the area, no question. Also, my friend apparently is a Boba tea enthusiast and almost lost her mind when she realized they served it here....so, if that is your thing...there you go!"
7/29/2015,4,"Definitely a place I would recommend and would return to. They have a wide variety of options representing Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese and Chinese cuisines. It was really tough to decide - I probably took 10 minutes looking at the menu because there are so many things I wanted to try. You can get a rice bowl or noodle bowl or soup bowl or bento box...My waitress was getting restless so I just went with one of their signature items - spicy cream rice bowl with chicken.  It wasn't really spicy fortunately but the sauce was very sweet. Too sweet, in fact and the main reason I went with 4 stars. It was good but I probably wouldn't order it again. No problem though as I'm sure I can find many other items on the menu to please my taste buds. Their drink menu is also extensive. Many flavors of milk teas, green teas and others that you can choose from and add jellies, pearls or boba to. They also serve a variety of beers and sake. Desserts include mochi and green tea ice cream.The restaurant has a cool, modern motif and the chefs frying, chopping, doing what they do, add to the ambience and energy of Bento.  They have many locations throughout Florida and soon TAMPA!!!!!"
6/16/2015,5,"American Sushi at its Best!Great new location with lots of parking.A lot of ""millenials"" enjoying dinner here!Restaurant Vibe is Chill!I had an excellent Sushi combo of: California Roll, Fuji Roll, Dragon Roll, Algae: Everything Delish!Check: Reasonable!I love it!!!"
10/30/2018,4,"Four star review with a caveat: I would never get any of the poke or sushi here. If I had to include a review of their poke/sushi options, this review would be 2 stars at best, but since I just ignore those options entirely, I'll base this review on their cooked entrees (bento boxes, rice bowls, etc).For the price, Bento delivers quality meals. Katsu chicken, curries, sriracha chicken, stir fry, even the vietnamese pork chops are awesome here. The miso is decent (not the best) and their servings are generous.They can be pretty busy, and the lines can move slow when new customers have all the options explained to them at the counter. But if you can wait for ~15 to place an order during a lunch rush, it's worth it. Even better if you can stop by when things are slow. Service is usually fast.Now let's talk about the sushi/poke options briefly. On the few rare occasions I've had the poke or sashimi, I've found bones. There have also been a handful of times that the tuna poke had very inconsistent quality in the same bowl (probably came from multiple fish, at multiple times of the day). And worse of all, the servers often forget during busy times to provide a soy sauce dish with sushi/sashimi entrees, and they can be impossible to call over since they only pop out to deliver food, and never to check on tables (it's a serve yourself environment).Despite having horrible experiences with the sushi/poke options (due to quality and service) I still love the rest of the options."
6/9/2017,5,"First time here. Order at a counter and a server brings your food to you.  I had the Sesame Chicken Bowl, rice, red bell peppers, zucchini, onions, snow peas and sweet soy sauce. Delish. Chicken was moist, the vegetables crunchy and the soy sauce blended all the flavors. The pork egg roll was crispy and savory. I had a lychee to drink, sweet with pulp. The server was attentive and continued to check with us. Excellent dining experience."
4/20/2017,4,"My favorite part of Bento Cafe is all of the options--you can get sushi, traditional American Chinese food, Poke Bowls, and a few other Asian options. I can be as healthy (or unhealthy) as I want, and everything is really reasonably priced.Until 5 Bento Cafe is more of a quick service restaurant--ordering at the counter and having the food delivered to you. After 5 it turns into the traditional sit-down experience, and I really wish it wouldn't. The service that I had when I visited last week was pretty terrible--my water was never refilled and it took ~15-20 minutes to get our food, which was pretty ridiculous for how un-busy it was. I've loved all of the sushi rolls that I've had here (the Florida roll is my favorite), and the krab wontons were tasty. Last time I went my boyfriend and I both ordered the General Tso's chicken, and we were really disappointed. The sauce didn't have nearly enough flavor--it just tasted like sweet, fried chicken. Overall, Bento Cafe is a great (relatively) local option for fast-casual food in the Dr. Phillips area."
4/19/2018,4,"Came here with my friend on a rainy evening-- great decision! This spot cured my craving for Asian food. Their boba was surprisingly delicious, I'll definitely be returning for it. The bento box was awesome-- lots of food and all delicious. Plus, noodles AND rice? Such a winner. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night, so we'll have to come back and try it out again!"
1/18/2018,4,"We go here often, mostly because it's close, and a great value for the sushi. We've only ever been for lunch. Sushi is always good, the udon soup is great, and the boba tea was the first thing that got us in the door. One of the few places on this side of town to get decent boba."
12/29/2017,3,Food was a little to oily for my likings. I ordered the Spicy Cream udon noodles. But it was surprising when my food had alot of oil.
4/30/2013,5,"**This update is based solely on the follow up**I was contacted by Bento Cafe's GM regarding my Yelp review about a week later, apologizing on my first experience at Bento's. She wrote about what had happened that night and invited us back to the restaurant to give it another chance. I was super surprised that the GM actually cared enough to reach out to me... that is AMAZING customer service. I definitely appreciate those in management/leader positions who acknowledge the problem, and do something about it to fix the situation. Great follow-up!"
11/14/2018,5,"I went this afternoon and had a great experience. The menu is clear and easy to understand, and the mini poke bowl isn't what i would consider small by any means- i'm going to get 2 meals out of it. the fish portion is generous and the flavors are delicious. it's a nice combination of self service and full service, the restaurant has a nice ambiance. I will definitely be back! My pic is after I had already taken a bite, very delicious!"
1/14/2018,4,"Constant customer! I am always coming here. Their sushi is yummy. But I will admit, do not come in here and expect their sushi to be the ultimate best, authentic sushi in the world because that's not Bento. Their sushi is tasteful, good portion size, and the price is very reasonable. Presentation is done well. They're other dishes like the rice or noodle bowls are also delicious. Spicy creme bowl is my favorite. I would recommend this place since their food is good and affordable!! The atmosphere is chill so that's another plus"
8/20/2015,5,"This place is very posh. And when we came during lunch time, it was absolutely packed. All the tables were taken, and there was a long line to order. I had a Milk tea bubble tea, sliced beef noodle soup, and we shared meat steamed dumplings (3). The bubble tea was pretty good! The tea was a little sweet, but I just added water. The bubbles had good taste. The noodle soup was such a big portion! The noodles were delicious and just the whole thing in general was delish haha The dumplings were ok My family got the bento boxes w salad lo mein They were Americanized, and not as good as my noodle soup!"
5/11/2015,5,"I don't know how this place doesn't have 5 stars. It's the best sushi restaurant. The rolls have so much flavor and are a good size. This time I got sushi rolls to go. Crunch roll-seaweed on the outside with tempura, tuna, cream cheese, krab and cucumber inside, eel sauce Special Mexican- shrimp, krab, avocado and cream cheese, spicy mayo sauce"
3/9/2015,3,"The three stars are for their slow service and boba.  I enjoyed the beef pad Thai.  Since I've been to so many sushi restaurants these past two months, I can't really say if I enjoyed it.  I'm sushi'd out lol.I also did the yelp check-in to get the free appetizer, but he didn't adjust that off the bill.  I even reminded him and he still didn't."
11/30/2015,3,"I've dined at Bento Cafe a number of times, and realized I've never written a review! Here goes:First, this place is a solid 3.5 stars. I really enjoy the food here. Their sushi has always been fresh and delicious. I really like the Bali High Mango, Gucci, and Volcano rolls. Of their stir fry / grill menu, you house flavor, a protein, and whether you want it a a Bento box, rice bowl, or noodle bowl. For the price, their portions are generous and filling. My favorites are the beef bulgogi, rr Mongolian beef, and the spicy cream chicken. I love bubble tea smoothies, sometimes with biba, sometimes with jelly. I'm sad to say their Boba is not always fresh. I've tried it multiple times, sometimes the texture is perfect, but just as many times the Boba is hard and cold. The jelly is always a safe bet here... although they did stop serving the strawberry jelly. Now they only have mango jelly (which they were out of tonight), passion fruit (I need to try), and lychee (yummm). They have also added on the fruit flavored bobas, the type you get at the frozen yogurt placea.  There are 2 flavors. I don't recall what flavor they are. When looking for a quick, fresh, delicious meal in the Restaurant Row area, Bento Cafe is a great option."
12/15/2019,1,"Not good... constant problems whenever I go or order online. Both with door dash and Uber eats always have problems. They are not customer centered, and do not try to accommodate their customers. They have messed up my order numerous times, and do little to fix it. Constantly forget items when I order online. Normally not one to complain, but they have messed up my order 90% of the time. Gets a bit old. And they aren't very apologetic. My parents have been in the restaurant business for many years.. your business will not keep its customers if it continues like this."
10/12/2015,4,"We loved the sushi that we tried here! It had a nice variety rolls to try. The happy hour deal kicked ass and allowed us to try even more rolls! Also, enjoyed the garlic edamame. This was the first time that we experience seasoned edamame and it was fantastic! It appeared that this location can get busy during peak hours."
12/20/2018,5,"I first came into Bento in a whim. I needed food and it was nearby, but boy was that a lucky choice. First of all, the restaurant is well-designed and CLEAN. It looks like a high quality national chain, despite being relatively small. Staff is friendly and the food never takes long, even if there are a lot of people there. They can handle a rush well.Now to the important part: the food. I'm not a huge fan of sushi, but they have plenty of other options. The bento boxes offer the opportunity to have some of their protein options without having too heavy of a meal. The rice bowls let you get a lot of their protein and the sides offer an easy way to sample some of their other fares. They have a lot of food/protein options that are highly customizable. Thus far, my favorites have been the garlic broccoli with steak and the Polynesian chicken. My mouth is watering just thinking of these.The prices are very reasonable for the amount and a quality of food you get. Overall, they have easily earned their 5 stars every single time I go. I would recommend this for a good work lunch or a casual night out!"
1/23/2019,4,"Ever since we discovered the place, we kept coming back every time we visit Orlando. The only place I really love the crab wanton. Don't get the egg rolls. Doesn't taste good.. sushi is not too expensive. The way the service of this place is kinda weird. Lunch time u order at the counter then take a seat. Dinner time they have servers. Kinda useless."
3/26/2018,4,This is a really great spot for some good sushi and they always have new rolls to try.  The place is super clean and the staff is very nice.  The setting is pretty relaxed but not super casual.  Their rice and poke bowls are really good too.  Only four stars because their service has always been rather slow.
5/27/2018,4,Great sushi! Fresh! They skimp on the wasabi but not hard to ask for more. I've only had the rainbow roll and edamame both times I'vegone. Staff is friendly. I've had bites of other rolls of my husbands and friends and they were great! Definitely recommend.
1/6/2017,1,"Service is almost non existence and they don't care. Management there is no presence at all. Came in on a Thursday night sign was up for please wait to be seated. Not a problem, waited for 5 minutes for someone to come up. When the hostess did arrive she stated that it would be 5 minute wait. Really there were empty tables all around and it's not like I had 10 people with me there were 3. I was trying to make the sushi happy hour and it ended at 6 lol I got seated at 557 and got attitude from the server to want to order."
3/8/2017,4,Not so bad! My daughter loves the boba tea choices and we usually get the lunch specials to maximize the meal choices. I'd love to go back and try some of their other sushi to see if it's as good as it looks. The menu is large and there is plenty of seating for everyone. Check it out and see what you find on the menu that you may like. I need to venture out some too so let me know.
10/6/2019,1,I give this place 1/2 star. First the crab wontons were just cream cheese. The garlic broccoli chicken noodles had no flavor. Would never go back.
3/10/2015,5,"This is by far my favorite Sushi spot in Orlando. In the last 2 months, I've probably gone 6-7  times. Their service has been GREAT each time and their food is fresh, quick & amazing! Great, laid back atmosphere. The ""Gucci"" is my favorite roll so I definitely recommend that with some chicken fried rice. Comes in a huge bowl, too! Their pricing is fair - pretty common for Sushi restaurants. For 2 plates of sushi and fried rice, my girl and I usually spend about $35."
5/17/2019,5,"SO SO GOOD. I was very happy to eat here. Happened to go with a large group of people for lunch and was very pleased. They did not have lunch menu but prices were amazing which is why I'll definitely be back. I paid $11.75 for the sushi combo box and I was so pleased. Very tasty and while I wasn't ""full"" after I was satisfied. Would e totally bought more since prices were minimal but I had somewhere to be after and did not want to get the itis. My food as well as my other party wmmeber who got sushi came out last compared to everyone else at my table who got cooked foods or poke bowls. But I'm certain that's because they had to hand roll the sushi at the counter so I'm okay with that. Plus it was a busy lunch hour on a FRIDAY so I was not phased when it came out 10-15 mins give or take after ordering. Place was very well kept and the staff was SUPER on top of clearing the table after eating. What's special is u get a complimentary special dipping sauce. I had the poke soy and it was AWESOMeeee if u like to dip your sushi in soy sauce I recommend that. There are others but this one seemed like the lightest option and closest to soy sauce. Also added a bit of wasabi which set it off. Wasabi was also fresh which I appreciated (meaning it was soft and not hard and had great taste--if u like and eat wasabi u know what I mean). Will totally be back! There's a happy hour too 3-6. And there's an extensive bubble tea list! And it's decently priced 3.5-7 I think. Great for families. Dates. And so on. Thanks bento!"
9/15/2017,4,"It's very hard to go wrong whenever you eat Bentos. I've been to multiple of their locations (Downtown Orlando, South Florida, and this one) and all of them always have pretty good service and of course good food. If you're ever craving for quick Asian food than bentos is definitely the way to go! Or if you're in the mood for pretty decent priced sushi or poke bowl too. Spicy cream chicken noodle bowl is always a favorite of mine as well as spicy tuna poke bowl."
4/7/2018,5,"My girlfriend and I recently tried this for the first time, she loves Poke Bowls and was interested to try this place out. I got the Mongolian bowl with Steak and mini udon, she got a Mexican roll with a salmon poke bowl. Every single bite was fantastic, the fish was top quality, and all the sauces were on point. The drinks were superb as well. But what really made this meal special was our server, Wenderson. He helped us decide what to get, with his own flares on certain plates and had a plethora of knowledge from the menu. He constantly checked on us, and was incredibly excited when he heard we loved our food. He is easily one of the best servers we have ever had, bar none! If you like Asian Fusion, make sure to stop by here, and don't hesitate to ask for Wenderson. He was an absolute delight and you can quickly tell he loves what he does and is an expert in his craft."
9/27/2020,2,Can't take a simple order online without messing it up. Very rude when i called and and complained.
6/30/2018,3,"The cashier was friendly and nice. There was 5 of us and  we ordered about $100 worth of food. Seems a little pricey for lunch, but maybe we have big appetites lol. The place wasn't very busy but half of the tables weren't clean? Okay maybe they finished with a rush... By the time I flagged someone and ask her to clean the table we wanted to sit at she just replied with ""don't worry I am on the way"", I wouldn't say it was with a negative attitude but I would assume I was bothering her by asking, based off of the tone in her voice. The dumplings came out pretty quickly and were delish! Great size and good portion. The bowls came out next. I had ordered the Szechwan beef and asked if i could get it with udon noodles. IT ALREADY COMES WITH UDON NOODLES. But the receipt isn't itemized so I can't confirm if I was up charged for the change to larger udon noodles. The sushi took the longest to come out, about 27 min for 6 rolls. They were good. The food was good, not great, I don't believe it's worth the price considering we have other options at the same price point for better quality."
6/14/2018,5,"Bento has great staff and management at all locations that I've visited. Very clean and welcoming.  The Bento Box menu item is my favorite along with some of the rolls I've ordered.  Never disappointed in my meal. I've introduced friends to Bento and they've been very pleased.The wait for my order is reasonable considering how busy they get at times.  In and out within a lunch break. If you haven't tried Bento, i assure you that you'll enjoy!Thank you owners and staff for making such a great product and for serving your guests with excellence.Eric"
10/10/2019,2,"Been here several times and the food really is great. Pretty dissatisfied with my experience tonight though. My experience tonight is owed to Jenyelle. When my wife and I walked up to the counter, it seemed like we rudely interrupted her conversation. She spoke apathetically and quietly. Clearly had better things to do. She got my order wrong (Szechuan noodle soup) and when I went up to have it corrected I was greeted with ""oh you wanted the noodle soup. Ok. that'll be $12"" I said no thanks I'm not paying more for what I should've had to begin with. I'll go to Susuru the next time I want ramen."
5/22/2017,1,So annoyed by them. I have eaten there several times. I have also Uber ordered as well. And it was amazing. And great price today I got all the way through placing an order for my family and then it said unavailable. So I thought fine I will call and pick it up. I was put on hold for 15 minutes. I figured they are busy and forgot me so I called again to only get a busy signal for the next 10 minutes of trying.
7/7/2019,5,"I went with my family from Jacksonville, because we LOVE Bento Jacksonville location, but we came to Orlando to enjoy our summer and decided stop at this bento to eat! We ordered volcano special thinking it was be the same menu as Jacksonville , but to our surprise, it's not! And the manager, Clarissa, made it possible for us and it was amazing!!!! Even better that the volcano special from the Jacksonville location! Five stars to this place for their food and their service!"
5/3/2013,4,"Consistently delicious! I tend to frequent Bento Cafe for dinner with a friend, and am never dissapointed. They offer an extensive sushi menu as well as several other dishes that can be cusomtives as a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box with your choice of protein. If you visit between 4PM and 7PM, the offer a happy hour which includes a buy two get one free sushi offer. Prices are resonable. A noodle bowl with tofu or chicken costs $7.75 and the Veggie Delite sushi roll I ordered costs $6.25. As I usually stick with vegetarian sushi, I enjoy Bento as they have a few more veggie options than most places. The Veggie Delite roll is by far my favorite, as it is topped with a piece of fried tofu that really adds to the roll. As far as the other entree options, I have always opted for the noodle bowl and have never been displeased. There are a good 20-30 different styles for the bowl, so I always look to try something new and always find it enjoyable. Bento Cafe also serves Boba tea. Although I have not tried it personally, I know it is something that is relatively rare in the Orlando area!I highly reccomend Bento Cafe!"
2/11/2020,2,"I came for the Tuesday Special which is the $6 chicken teriyaki bowl & I added the Special Mex roll (4 pieces) for $5 & of course I couldn't leave without the BOBA tea BOGO (Buy 1 get 1 free). The wait was pretty long (10 mins to order) but it was pretty busy which is expected on a Tuesday. When I placed my order the waiter was VERY rude. She told me the wait for my 4 piece roll would be 20-35 mins, I just asked her why is that? Out of curiosity & She replies ""because were busy"" with a huge attitude & rolled her eyes. So I ignored it and placed my order anyway. I noticed another guest had a Bento card and got stamps so I asked her about it and wanted to get stamps as well, yes she gave me one but when my friend asked for one she rolled her eyes. Very unprofessional. So after we take our seat our food comes out. The sushi she said would take 20-35 mins came after 3 mins , the teriyaki bowl comes 5 mins later. The portion was pretty big however, my chicken was so dry I left all the chicken and just ate the rice and green beans however I didn't get my BOBA tea until I have eaten 80% of my bowl. (About 30 mins later) And when I mention my tea was missing the staff is acting like I annoy them. It was to the point where we were scared to ask for a To-go box. But after finding the courage to ask for one, the staff points to the TRASH can where the to-go boxes are located upside down ! Very nasty image when you think about putting food in it. However the only good thing I can say is the Special Mex roll was the highlight. Very good. The BOBA BOGO deal is great too if you can find a tea that's actually tasty. Overall I had to give the restaurant a 2/5 stars and that's being generous."
8/15/2019,5,"This place is my jam after work! So friendly, the food is amazing, and such quick service! But I'm so sad they took away so many Milk tea flavors! The LAVENDER MILK TEA was my favorite! Please bring it back! My cashier/server was so sweet to punch my boba tea card extra when he realized they didn't have what I wanted."
11/12/2016,5,Was looking for an Asian Fusion place near Universal and this place was amazing. I just wish I could have tried more of their menu and that they had a location in Tampa.I love that they price some of their sushi rolls at 4 pieces. The terriyaki chicken bent was amazing and the rice bowls are huge.
4/3/2018,5,"Bento's sushi never fails. Honestly it's sooooo good, though the prices may be higher than other sushi spots it's delicious. Our server Shaun was the best. He's helped us before and he's part of the reason we come"
6/30/2020,5,The sushi is fresh and great and the ramen noodles are good!! If I'm ever back in the area I will be eating here for sure!
6/17/2017,5,Food was delicious. Very good flavors and nice presentation. BUT customer services is the worst ever!! We have to put our hands up like 10 times for one of the servers noticed us. Since the moment we arrive I knew it was gonna be tragic the greeter wasn't in the front we had to wait for him. But well... food is really good and the place very cute. Other than that needs better customer service
4/7/2019,4,I like this place but my wife and her family say the quality has gone down over the years. Decent Asian food at a decent price. Food comes quick.
7/24/2020,5,I love everything about this place. I've been going for years. Buuuuuut I think it's time for the sushi chef to sharpen his knives haha... the rolls weren't cut all the way through. Still super tasty tho
5/8/2020,5,This Bento service is great. This was the first place I dined at after moving to FL. The food is good and I will go back.
7/20/2019,4,The environment at the restaurant was pretty chill. The staff was awesome and made the experience great for my family and I. I ordered the yellow curry and it was exactly what I expected. The only thing I would have liked to have improved was the salad didn't have as much ginger sauce as I expected. Other than that would definitely recommend anyone who likes Asian food.
7/14/2020,4,I used to come all the time until it went downhill. I'm glad I decided to give them another try because I was very impressed with how they were handling covid procedures. I really hope they keep their online ordering system after all of this because it is so much easier than being placed on hold multiple times when trying to place an order for pick up.
9/5/2016,5,Second time was as good as the first. The sesame chicken bento box was delicious and plenty of food for the money.We'll be back!
3/24/2017,4,"If it hadn't been for service, I would have given it less stars but the food here is absolutely incredible! The make your own poke bowl is our favorite. We love to combine tuna and salmon with the mixed greens. Our favorite sauces are poke soy and spicy mayo.The problem we have with service is that wait staff pretends to know how to take orders without writing it down on paper but they really don't have that kind of experience. It's totally OK to humble yourself and take down the order on paper just to make sure it gets in for the chefs the right way."
9/9/2016,5,This is our go to sushi spot. We've been patrons of Bento for many years now. They have great options if you're not a sushi lover. They have great prices and the quantity of food is fantastic. Try the O-town roll. It's my personal favorite and it's quite delicious. Check in on Yelp and get a free app. We always get the pork pot stickers. Fried of course.The servers are always friendly and attentive. I was looking for my server and another server swung by to see if we were okay.They also now provide wi-fi which is awesome since their building has terrible cell service. This is a great place to pop in and out if you're in a time crunch.
8/6/2020,5,"I don't ever leave reviews but the service that Bento's gives even during this pandemic is better than any other restaurant I've been to since quarantine. You order at the door but the two people taking our order were really nice and helpful with everything we needed. We then waited outside for our food to be made and it was pretty hot outside so after a few minutes one of the guys who took our order came outside and joked around with us a little bit before asking if we wanted water bottles and immediately got them for us. Very good service and nice people, oh yeah and the food was absolutely fantastic as well :)"
4/18/2019,5,"I have been to a lot of Bentos but this location is great! From the sushi to the boba teas everything taste amazing. I can also truly say that the front hostess employee Echo, was absolutely the most helpful hostess/server I've ever had! Not only did she know practically everything on the menu she was also able to multitask! She helped a line of people ordering in such an efficient and timely matter while answering phone calls and giving out Uber eats! Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting some good food and even better service!"
6/17/2019,1,"I agree with everything she said (Sarah C.), but would like to add, at her suggestion: Try Pei Wei instead!"
5/1/2019,4,"I've been coming here for a long time it's always a solid place to go for some sushi and rice bowls. I usually get the Korean rice bowl little bit spicy which is my thing and super filling! Very satisfying meal, only thing need to work on is being a little more efficient when ordering"
11/13/2018,5,I'm addicted. It's seriously the best. Everything they have is amazing! Bento sushi box
2/18/2015,4,"Bento Cafe is always a stop my friends and I take when in Gainesville, Jacksonville, and Orlando. Another restaurant Tampa could use! Bento was a variety of options of Asian cuisine to choose from- Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc. After you choose your ""style"", you get to choose the main protein of the dish (chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp) as well as whether it comes in a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. The price varies of these three options but usually one meal is never more than $10 which is a steal!Their sushi is also pretty okay. Out of all the rolls I've ordered I have yet to be amazed at the sushi but that's not to say it's bad or anything. I just have yet to try any signature rolls. Overall, I am always satisfied with the food and recommend the spicy cream shrimp, chicken katsu, and bulgogi! The service is also always excellent."
1/31/2019,4,"First time at Bento and it was awesome! Ordering was easy, but it did take a little bit for our food to finally come out, but that's probably because half my family ordered sushi rolls. I had the bento sushi, which comes with the California roll (I think), then you pick two special rolls. I had the Mexican and the Rainbow roll. The rainbow roll was definitely my fav of the three. All of them were so delicious though. And did I mention they have Thai Tea!? I think it was about $3.50 and it comes in a pretty decent size. No refills though of the specialty drinks so drink 'em slow. I can't wait to go back and try their Boba teas!!"
1/17/2020,2,"I used to live downtown and went to that one weekly. So when this one opened up I was so excited. I was thinking this is my new spot. The food and customer services was always amazing at the other location so I was set. Unfortunately, for this location the customer service & food isn't as good. We've been in a couple times and every time something comes out wrong or if I get a to go order I'm always missing an item. I normally say something or call if that happens but they don't really care much. The food is great when I get it correctly. The customer service just feels like they don't care. It is what it is to them. Some people don't care about customer service but it can make or break a place to me."
8/18/2017,5,Great food. This place is good for lunch. They have good-quality sushi. Their vegetable and steak stir fry also tastes great.
7/12/2014,4,We love this place! Best deal is the sushi box.  My favorite roll is the Mt. Fugi sushi roll. We also love the Korean beef bulgogi and the Japanese curry. Pretty much can't go wrong with anything.
4/30/2018,4,"My kids and I ate here for dinner a few nights in Orlando. I know that these places have been around for some time, but I've never been to one even in Philly. My first time trying a bento box was delightful to say the least. Everything was delicious and fulfilling. The entire time we spent in Orlando, Bento Cafe was really the only place I wanted to eat. The variety of choices was appealing mostly because I am a vegetarian. So it was good to find a place to eat that accommodated my diet. The menu could be a little overwhelming, so many types of protein, sauces, noodles, etc. My next stop will be to find a good Bento cafe in Philly, I'm sure someone has Yelped about one, lol."
4/7/2017,3,This place was ok.  Fried rice dishes were decent.Bento box was lacking...only the entree was good.  Salad was old and wilted.  Noodles had NO flavor.Service was alright.I won't be back...
7/31/2018,5,"My girlfriend and I are constantly going here just about every other week. It's perfect for date night, sushi is amazing, chicken bowls are amazing, boba teas are amazing, there's nothing bad about this place!!"
12/18/2017,1,TODAY WAS TERRIBLE No avocado no brown riceServers was too slow...Holidays coming up ?I think quality is getting lower and lower
5/13/2020,1,"I used to love coming to this location like 5, 6 years ago but it has gone so downhill in the past couple years. From the customer service to how they prepare the food, definitely the worst Bento franchise which is very disappointing because it's the closest one to me. The straw that broke the camels back was this last Ubereats order, I wrote in the notes that I have an avocado allergy. When I received the order, I saw that they wrote on the receipt ""no avocado"" so I know that they saw it, and of course, my roll had avocado on it. The restaurant was closed after my food arrived so I did not expect for them to replace my food tonight but I called to let them know the error and how inconvenient it is for me now that I have nothing to eat for dinner. I work in a restaurant myself and allergies are to be taken very seriously! However, the woman I spoke to on the phone was so rude. I asked to speak to a manager because I wanted to make sure someone took this complaint seriously and she claimed that she was the manager, but I doubt it being she had such a bad attitude. I'd expect more patience from a manager, especially since I was not being out of line or rude myself even though this was very inconvenient to me, I do have respect for other people. I regret not asking for her name. Anyway, now I'm stuck here with nothing to eat for tonight & I will not be giving this location any more chances. Very disappointed. :("
4/16/2016,5,"By far the best Japanese restaurant ever. Sushi is first rate and the service is killer. For sushi I strongly recommend the Special Mexican Roll and a classic Spicy Tuna. For an entree, definitely go for the bento boxes as they're a great value. When you go ask for Jessica her service is above and beyond and definitely not just ""alright"". I'd eat at this restaurant everyday if I could.Ps Josh you shouldn't have taken Jessica out of your Yelp review just saying."
7/5/2014,4,"Happy hour is amazing!  Buy 2 rolls, get 1 free.  Doesn't get much better than that especially if you're hungry :)Well done! I'll definitely be coming back."
5/11/2019,5,Great fresh food. If your vegetarian. Tofu is great with that cream sauce. The sushi is so fresh as well.
9/24/2017,2,"Let me start by stating how much I love the food and the service at the downtown location. Now moving on to the Sandlake establishment.......1. They messed up our order and the server wasn't professional enough to say sorry or let me get my manager....... nope. He said : "" I didn't hear you order."" ..... really??2. Brings the order 20 minutes behind the rest of my table. 3. The check comes and the same server charges me for the others on the tables food and mine, plus takes 20 in cash that was provided by one if the people at the table.4. After all this inconvenience....... you would think a manager would appear correct???? Well nothing. Zip.Worst experience ever. Thing is I love the food, but this location has no professional courtesy whatsoever. Very disappointing."
2/20/2016,1,"I love going to this place never had a lot of issues but let me tell you why I gave it one star. I placed a to go order for their limited edition pork ramen soup and come to find out when I get there that I in fact couldn't get it to go after I've already paid for it. Now that's fine, it's whatever. But here's the kicker. When I got home and I'm digging into my salad I bite into something hard and rubbery and when I take it out, upon further examination, it's a wad of fucking gum. Old ass gum. It looked as if someone picked it out from the trash and placed it into my salad. I'm livid, who wouldn't be? So I called and spoke to the manager and I'm upset because I feel like it wasn't taken seriously as it should have been. I'm really saddened about my experience but unfortunately this will be my last visit."
5/7/2019,3,Get ready for you me food to take forever.  The food is very good and the boba tea is great.  The workers are nice but it just takes forever.  Every time I've gone I wait awhile.  It's quicker for food if you eat there.  Today I went to order to go.  I waited 22 minutes for a salad poke bowl and boba tea.  Another time I ordered ahead and it told me 20 which was fine I get there at 20 minutes later and got the email saying it was ready but then inside they tell me it's not and I waited 10 minutes.  There was then no point even ordering ahead.
4/5/2018,5,"The food was great! Very clean, loved the boba tea. Also enjoyed the free appetizer for checking in) Will definitely go back again!"
6/17/2016,5,"Excellent fried rice, boba tea, chicken katsu and beef bulgogi. Service was excellent! Highly recommend this place! Too bad there's no Bento Cafe in Chicago."
6/29/2018,5,"Had pad Thai and ""create your own"" veggie roll for take out. It was delicious. Plenty for two. Reasonably price. Will definitely be back."
2/9/2019,5,"Delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect and they definitely exceeded my expectations. Had the miso soup, a chicken teriyaki boul and some salad. All in all great experience."
9/7/2016,5,"We love this place. They have so many options so it's the place to go when you're craving good quality Japanese food. The bento box is jam-packed with food that will keep you satisfied for the rest of the day. So happy this is in a close location to me, making that amazing menu so accessible. The curry katsu is phenomenal!"
7/20/2017,5,"I visit Bento at least once a week. I love it. I've dined in, placed orders for pick up by phone, and placed takeout orders in person. I've never had a bad experience. They have amazing customer service. On Tuesdays, they have buy one get one free bobba tea and specials on week days between 4-6pm...like buy two sushi rolls get one free! My go to roll is the Miami roll with teriyaki sauce. I've had rice and noodle bowls as well the bento boxes. The red curry katsu is amazing. I also recommend the pineapple Thai fried rice. Like I said, I've never had something I didn't like from Bento Asian Kitchen!"
4/24/2014,5,"I was so happy to find a Bento in Orlando as it was one of my favorite places for cheap eats in Gainesville. It was just as good as I remembered. I've never had sushi from Bento, I always get their namesake bento box and it's always delicious. Curry Katsu chicken is the way to go and ginger beef is close runner-up. Not sure if my next trip will be to Orlando or Gainesville, but I know it will include a stop at Bento Cafe either way. Highly recommend!"
3/4/2018,3,"I have such a fondness (bordering on addiction) for Bento. I've been frequenting them since I was a college student back in the days when they only had the one location in Gainesville & I had friends that worked there. Then, I essentially chased them all around Florida as the new locations started popping up in Jacksonville, Tally, Orlando, & Davie. The thing is this place has all my Japanese food fave's: lots of milk tea options & toppings, customizable sushi bowls, modern casual, & young vibe. I've been to all their locations except one. At this location, the taro milk tea & pearls was very creamy & sweeter than I last remember. The spicy cream & sweet and sour chicken bento boxes were delicious & exactly like others. The dynamite roll & crunch roll were both good, but the crunch roll wasn't very warm when it came out & was practically cold after a few minutes which isnt something you want from a deep fried roll. Ordered a salmon & eel don that was perfectly fresh & tasty. While the server at this location was very sweet, she disappeared for long periods of time & the wait was rather excessive. Appetizers came out within 10-15 min but the meal took forever... at least 45 min to an hour. I had to stand up to ask for appetizer plates we never received, then sauces, and then to-go boxes... Another let down today was the the eel sauce was watery. Either way, I would still go back again & again because my love for Bento seriously runs deep."
10/19/2016,5,I've been coming to Bento Café for years and it's always great. I usually get the general Tso noodle bowl with mini udon noodles & tofu - so good! Also the seasonal zombie roll they have right now is awesome. Bento is relatively cheap for the amount of food you get. Love this place and I always come back :)
8/28/2014,4,Found this Gem on Yelp as I was driving around the area. I have expectations coming from CA. I ordered the Chirashi bowl. This chefs choice sashimi dinner was great and was presented well. The wait staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere is very young and chill. I will be coming back soon. Especially to have my sashimi fix.A suggestion would be for the sushi chefs to cut the raw fish pieces in thinner slices. It helps make it nore appealing and will help even out mouth portions during meal. Sashimi is normally served thinner to be eatten with rice. The thicker the piece the more it resembles cubed beef.
12/25/2018,5,"I enjoy coming here for the spicy cream chicken. I should of ordered on the phone since i wasn't gonna eat at the restaurant, so I had to wait for some time. Even though their system was down during that time, their staff knew how to handle each transactions."
2/27/2018,2,"Before I even begin, I've been coming to Bento's for the past 7 years or so. Over time I've realized how much has changed throughout the restaurant and as a person who throughout college worked in a restaurant, I look forward to changes in an establishment. But the changes that have been occurring at Bento Cafe is one I do not like at all.They have taken away certain sushi menu items.They use to give a discounted price for the lunch sushi bento box, but that no longer exists. They also were able to substitute the California roll out for another classic roll or could change out a classic roll and use one of the specialty rolls for an added up charge. I was always happy and willing to do that because I knew that what ever sushi that came in that bento box, I knew i was going to eat it and not have it go to waste. Now the main reason I decided to write this complain...I came in this past Sunday with my boyfriend who had only been to this establishment once before. first of all, they tell us to sit at the sushi bar and someone will be with us, but we apparently were suppose to order at the counter.. so we were waiting at the bar for a hot minute. Then when the food came out, it came out with the shrimp being tempura-ed, but nowhere next to the food item did it state it would be. My bf dislikes tempura anything and so we were disgruntled. We informed a manager and it took him FOREVER to come to us then he says he can change and it says that for the way we want it,it'll be a $1 up charge but they will take care of it. First of all, yes you were going to take care of it, and second of all, there is a way to speak to guests. The issues isn't at all about price, because we would've paid for that plus more, but the professionalism in the management team is severally lacking. Then he has the audacity to charge us for mushrooms... you just ""comped"" the redo meal and we still technically paid for the first meal that was ALL wrong, but now want us to pay for mushrooms? yeah no. At the same time as we were waiting for our meal, which took over 30 minutes, two other guests were complaining about horrible service. And then the manager has the audacity to ignore us the rest of the time and give us rude looks. How UN-professional.SERVICE is ridiculous. Corporate really needs to get this checked because my boyfriend has made it very clear that he'll never step foot into that establishment nor recommend it to anyone."
11/1/2016,4,"Good food, nice location near hotel, fast service.What more can you ask for, was surprised it was so good with the lunch rush and as busy as they were"
10/31/2015,1,"If you like good sushi that you can pay to wear with a side order of awkward interaction with your server this is the place to go!Where most servers have the common courtesy of saying, ""hello my name is"" as an introduction was lost with her. She continued the awkward silence with standing there looking at us, when anyone else would say are you ready to order? She then brought us our appetizer which was incorrect. The grand finally of this painful experience was her splattering us with soy sauce! Once again this servers lack common courtesy  only muttered,  ""oh"" then grabbed the splattered plate and went to the kitchen. After wiping ourselves off and asked for the manager we were approched by the hostes claiming she was the manager. She appologized, gave a minor bad service credit, comped us the small appetizer, then presented us with the bill. To bring this to an end, we come here often when we want good sushi. This has changed everything for us and we are telling our friends about this as well."
12/26/2016,5,Spicy cream chicken.... Enough said!You get plenty to eat with it including noodles or rice. Ask for extra sauce and pour over your noodles!
6/14/2014,5,"I love the sushi bowls at Bento! I feel like I haven't been able to get something similar to their sushi bowls anywhere else. It seems like a simple menu item but haven't found a place that has a similar taste to it. The  combination of the sushi rice flavor, wakame  salad, avocado and fish with spicy sauce is excellent! I highly recommend it. I personally like the spicy tuna and salmon don. Don't forget to check into yelp and get a free appetizer with a $10 purchase!"
6/4/2018,5,"Alright, so this is my friends and I's favorite spot when we're craving Asian food. Inside, it's a very modern environment. I used to always get the rice bowl with spicy cream chicken-- let me tell you, spicy cream is the BEST sauce and it's actually not that spicy for those who aren't a spice fan. However, as of lately I've been ordering their noodles, and I've officially turned over. SO good! Their krab wontons and sushi rolls are also a must have when you eat here."
10/6/2015,5,"Always a busy restaurant at lunchtime since you get the flow of office workers from the nearby office buildings. Get here around 11:30 or you'll be waiting. Can't go wrong with the Hot & Sour soup or the Spicy Cream with Tofu on top of mini-udon noodles. They have lots of selections and endless combos you can make and it's all catered to your taste. Service is quick and food is consistent. Once you're done eating in, just leave everything on the table and you're good to go."
12/15/2019,4,"The menu had many options. Quick turnaround on our order. We tried the poke bowl, ramen, dumplings (steamed is a must), and a few other items I can't recall. Everything was really good. We would opt for Bento over Pei Wei."
1/26/2019,3,"Writing this review as a 2 out of 5 on the hope that the food is at least good but couldn't tell you, because I've been waiting on a NOODLE BOWL WITH CHICKEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR as 3 tables behind me with a bigger party, get their food before myself. I've never had to wait so long......Update- food was average for a sushi place recommend the volcano roll, compensated for the wait with a $15 gift card... they made up for it."
9/17/2018,5,"I've been coming to this bento since I was in high school (10 year high school reunion just happened if that indicates how long it's been!) and our server, Windser, was absolutely amazing. My friend in I came in for a quick, informal birthday dinner and he was the most attentive, kind, sweetest server I'd ever had there! Wanted to take a moment to let you know what a fantastic employee you all have. He made my entire night! Thank you Windser for such a lovely evening"
10/25/2018,5,Phenomenal food and service! Sriracha garlic chicken is hands down my favorite item on the menu! I come here as often as I can! Love this place so much! Favorite spot to introduce my friends to! They've all fallen in love with it every time!
2/22/2019,1,"It took 15 min for a togo miso soup. I know it's premade. So 15 min to ladle it in a container, put a lid on it and put it on a bag."
4/16/2018,4,"The food at bento isn't supposed to be fantastic quality, for me this restaurant is made for fast Japanese style food. I feel like bento definitely does that right.. I'm a huge fan of their red curry bowl. People tend to try their sushi, but I'm not a huge fan. Their bowls are worth a try!"
8/11/2018,5,It's amazing food. I enjoyed the spicy cream chicken noodle bowl and I would definitely rate it as one of the best food in Orlando.
6/18/2019,1,"Went in for their ""free sushi"" roll today. Waited 25 min on a broken foot with no communication from the staff. When I was shoved by a server going to her table, she told me the wait was at least 45 min after you actually order your food. When I spoke with the manager she said it was at least an hour and that servers should be coming through the line to communicate. Not a single one was doing that. What a waste of time and no kind of accommodations for people who aren't able to stand.  The line is around the corner and mostly in the rain. Such a shame that a business who's been around this long doesn't know how to communicate or prepare for a large crowd when there's a promotion going on. It's not even like people get to choose what they want off the menu(everyone gets a choice of spicy tuna, Mex, or chicken tempura). Even though it's ""free"" it's a waste of time, patience, and a lack of respect towards the customer."
4/27/2015,2,"Unfortunately two stars for service and atmosphere based on multiple visits at both lunch and dinner time.The last straw was Wednesday: while waiting to put our names in for a table, a lady came barging past everyone in line saying she was going was going to put her name on the list. I politely told her that we, along the people in front of us, were waiting in line to do the same when to hostess came back. After the hostess took our names we were all told the wait was ""15 -20 min plus"" (even though half the tables were empty) because they only had 3 servers and could not sit anyone at any of the empty tables. A few minutes later the hostess comes back up front and calls not the next name on the list, but the name of the lady who tried to barge past everyone and seats her party of 3 before any of the people who have been waiting well before she got there. Another guest comments that they usually sit people of similar background before others. WTF? You get preferential seating at Bentos because you have the same ethnic background as the hostess?  There were many other groups of people who had been waiting well before we even got there got there (partys of 2, 3 & 4) who were still waiting for a table - and they did not seemed happy either that this happened. That was the last straw - we left and went next door to eat and most likely will not be back for a long while - if ever.I will say that the food is usually good, however the last time we ordered Crab Rangoons they were soaked in whatever grease they are fried in - grease literally filled the insides and leaked out when they were broken apart.  After telling the server they were not edible, he just looked at the plate and then took it and walked away. When the bill came we had to ask that they be removed from the check, to which he said we ordered them. I had to remind him that they were full of grease and in addition, we had redeemed the free Yelp appetizer offer so we should not have been charged in any event. I had to show him the Yelp app again to prove it so he would take them off the bill.Just a few other issues with service / atmosphere that add to why we will not be back:~ If you come for lunch, come early because they will have only one register open for walk in orders and the other one for call in orders. They will take individual orders for a large party then insist on giving the entire table the same number - somehow this translates into half of your party getting soup at the end of the meal, one person getting food, and the rest having to sit around until all sushi or kitchen food is ready at same time so some is cold or forgotten. One time we were told it would be a 25 minute additional wait for food (AFTER we all ordered and sat at a table) because they needed every sushi / kitchen chef to help catch up on take out orders. FYI Bentos - not everyone is a tourist and some of us need to get back to work from our lunch break. Our party woukd have gone elsewhere if we were told this upfront.~ Multiple times there have been fruit flies swarming the tables in the back which is never a good sign.~ The women's restroom used to have a small tv in an alcove advertising the specials (like in the main room)- this looks to have been literally ripped out of the wall as all that is left is an empty dusty space with cables and holes in it. It has been this way for over 6 months.~ We have seen servers napping in the back booth during slow dinner hours~ One of the booths by the side window has a major tear in the seat cushion- large enough to snag on clothing. This has been this way for close to a year, and the hostess never seems to understand why I don't want to sit there if I'm wearing a nice dress. Some duct tape would probably help if they need a cheap fix. It won't look pretty but it will prevent snagged clothing. ~ If using the free Yelp appetizer, check your bill - 9 times out of 10, you will have to remind the server to take off the appetizer.~ If dining durring happy hour, check your bill to be sure the correct HH prices were used and not the regular prices. Normally we would let some of these items go on an occasional basis, but they have become a consistent issue. Also, how hard is it to have general repairs made? If the area the public sees is like that, what does the kitchen look like?Overall, this is a shame because, as I said, the food was usually good (exception being those greasy ragoons) and it was one if the lower priced sushi options in the Restaurant Row area. However, there are many other places to get sushi (and be seated in the order you came in)."
4/24/2018,4,"Have loved Bento since living in Gainesville even before they opened up their Orlando locations.  My favorite entrees are the Szechuan chicken and the red curry chicken as a noodle bowl or a bento box.  For those unfamiliar with the box, it usually contains green beans, ginger salad, lo mein noodles, white rice and a dessert.  I also enjoy their boba tea from time to time.  They can get busy in the evenings when it turns into a sit down restaurant so plan on getting there before you turn hangry."
9/12/2016,1,"Took 30 min at the register to find Hamachi Kama item, then they charged us double for that (they put different item in it , price was 15$) been eating this item over 3 years never paid 15$ (8$ some changes) our server Silvia came back told us that it's what it is , ( she went to her young asian looking manager , and manager didn't even bother herself to come and talk to us to  find a solution, she just ignored us and start texting )  we decided to return that order and get our money back ! Never will be back in to this location! Downtown location you are only one that I ever will go , IF I GO AGAIN !!!!! Thank you for great memories Sand Lake Location.Tips for owners- pls train your managers before putting them on the floor , if you don't want to loose all your customers! ( I was spending in Bento locations weekly around 200$) NEVER AGAIN!"
12/2/2018,5,"I really enjoy my meal every time I come here. The sushi bowls are my favorite, I usually get one of the house specials like spicy tuna, or I make my own with the many choices of delicious options. I am also a sucker for the boba teas, I can't figure out why such a strange drink is so tasty. I just took the whole family and even the kids found food they really liked (fried rice, grilled chicken)."
11/17/2015,5,"Best Sushi in town! Mount Fuji and special Mexican are my favorite! I love the staff they are all so nice! Special thanks to Jade, Jessica, Carrie, John, Kevin, Ray! For making me feel like family :) the only thing I'd change about this place is their water as it taste like lake water!"
6/27/2016,3,"Amazing as usual. My szechuan beef noodle soup was great!! My cousin's sriracha garlic chicken was good.But the spicy creamy shrimp was a BIG disappointment. I remember back in the college days of Gainesville UF & post-college eating at this location the shrimp was normal sized and delicious. I don't know what they did, or if it's because of food cost/economy, the shrimp inside the breading has become micro-sized. Literally barely any shrimp for the size of breading. I hope this gets corrected."
5/11/2018,5,"It's our first night in Orlando... we came here and had a wonderful experience! The service was great, especially our waiter Winderson was AWESOME! He took really good care of us. One of our family members didn't like the dish that was turned out, but Winderson was so patiently helping us! Highly recommended!"
11/8/2018,2,"I honestly prefer the Downtown Orlando location. Downtown has much better service, quality of the food is different and the sauces are FREE.The location at Sand Lake just coming in the floors are sticky, tables are as well and the smell is bad as soon as you sit down."
10/12/2017,4,"Decent vegan options, but make sure to ask your server since a lot of the sauces have fish in them. I was told by the helpful server that on the entree menu the Red Curry, Yellow Curry, Sesame Soy and Sriracha Garlic were the only vegan sauces. That being said, we ordered the Red Curry and Sriracha Garlic rice bowls with Tofu. They were both pretty good, I think I like the Sriracha Garlic and fried tofu better though and will get that if I go back. The Red Curry was good too, but after almost devouring the whole thing I noticed what looked like a small bristle in my bowl. It could have been a piece of my chopsticks?Or maybe the from the snow peas? After seeing that I noticed more little pieces and wasn't able to figure out what it was so I stopped eating it. I'd go back and try something different, but I'll be searching for those bristles the whole time! There were a lot of fingerprints on the front door like they hadn't cleaned in a month which kinda made me want to wash my hands before I even sat down. Overall though, service was amazing, and food tasted good, just needed a little detailed cleaning."
10/29/2018,5,My Girlfriend and I came here for Dinner last Night and I was Highly impressed. I don't care for Sushi but they had other Menu options and I can't wait to come back !
4/4/2015,2,"I have been this place's one of the best customers last 5 years. To be honest very good quality sushi with great prices. I try to eat here almost twice a week but unfortunately something going on here last couple of months. You can easily see that quality of service was descending. Today (Saturday 7 pm) which is prime time for restaurants, i came to eat with 5 people. They do not have COKE to drink which they say out of stock, NO Silverware (no fork no spoon) to eat, and NO plates. Also NO Lobster to use in the specific sushis. This is on Saturday evening. Are you kidding me? It looks like a joke but correct."
7/31/2018,5,"This place is always a staples for my mother and I. Great food but this particular visit our server William was absolutely amazing he was extraordinarily kind, wellmannered, and provided over the top service. He should be where the bar is set for all wait staff in restaurants. Kudos William and thanks for the great service! Returning for he food and William's service next week!"
12/7/2015,4,"I have been to this location several times and have always left happy. I really enjoy the crab wontons and have ordered several different sushi rolls. The sushi rolls are very fresh and tasty, not the absolute best I have ever had, but still very good. I have tried the bento boxes, sushi combo, and a noodle bowl or two. The value is excellent.This is one of the few sushi places I have gone to that I feel is truly family-friendly. I have an 11 month old who likes to yell out of happiness, smile and stare at people in neighboring booths, and drop a snack or five on the ground. Every time we have come here, there have been several families dining with young children and it is pretty nice to be able to relax and not worry about bothering other patrons.Get a boba tea to go and check in on Yelp for a free app!"
3/20/2013,2,"We just had a very disappointing experience at this location.  This was our 3rd or 4th visit, and we probably won't be back.  By far the worst part was my husband's dish.  He ordered the steak teriyaki bowl with white rice and broccoli.  The rice was just horrible.  It was very dry and overly chewy, it was either old, not cooked properly, or both.  I didn't try the steak, but my husband said it was tough and bland.  The service was also disappointing.  We were seated pretty quickly and didn't wait long for our dishes, but upon receiving our plates our server never, ever checked back.  My husband wanted a fork instead of chop sticks but our server was either at another table or behind the register on the other side of the restaurant.  Every other server who briskly walked by didn't once make eye contact with us so, he was stuck with the chop sticks.  I had to grab soy sauce off of another table because I knew there wasn't going to be any brought at any time.  Our server did come by the table once, but we were done eating.  She brought the check and after waiting waiting for her to pick it up and bring back changed we decided to leave what cash we had which was a slightly lower tip than originally planned, but in retrospect seems fair.  It's also worth noting, that when we got our drinks, I asked for some sugar packets for my tea and was told the restaurant was out of sugar, they only had sweet n low.  This was not my first bad service experience at this restaurant but the first time the food was unacceptable as well.  They have gotten my sushi order right each time however, but based on this most recent experience, I don't think I will ever go back."
1/14/2016,4,"I have been here several times and all my friends love Bento. I really enjoy it too, everything tastes fresh, and it is a quick and good-priced place to eat. I'm not too crazy about their teriyaki bowls, but my friends love it. I've had the pad Thai a few times and it's decent as well. There are tons of healthy options here which are great too."
9/25/2019,5,If you want good Asian food that's made quick...I suggest Bento. Good food and for a decent price.
1/29/2016,4,"Service is still oooohhh soooo slooooowww.  But I found a way around it, just order pick up! New Bento favorites -- Curry Katsu and Spicy Cream.  A++For bubble tea -- On tuesdays, it's BOGO (buy one, get one)!  And don't forget to get their boba card which entitles you to one free bubble tea after you buy a certain number of bubble teas."
1/12/2010,4,"Great VALUE and tons of CHOICES!  You get a lot more than you would at other Asian/ethnic casual restaurants.  A lot of sides and the bento box is great for a take out lunch to take back to the office.I went on a slow Monday night and they were experimenting on the ""full-table-service"" versus their original order at the counter format. Not sure if they are going to stick with the full service but I hope they don't raise prices to go full service.If anyone is a ""boba"" or ""bubble tea"" fan they serve them there too!"
3/1/2018,3,"I loved the Bento in Gainesville and was pretty good when I came to this location a couple of years ago. But I've been twice in the past three months and it's just lacking. Both times they were out of the noodles that go in pad thai, and the items I got were just ok. I'd go back to Bento if someone I'm with wanted to go, but it definitely hasn't been a memorable experience lately."
7/24/2019,4,The food is consistently freshly made and tasty.  This is our go to in Dr Phillips for shrimp fried rice.
6/3/2018,2,"Foods good but not the best in the area for the style also I went in once for bubble tea and they didn't have boba, so I asked I'd be paying less since I wasn't getting full product and the girl ringing me up rolled her eyes at me and charged me full price. That's annoying to me as most places boba cost extra. There's it comes with the drive but if it's not with the drink why should I pay the same price for just milk tea then milk tea with boba. Also I wasn't told there wasn't Boba until after it was made, so I wasn't given the option to change my mind about it, I mean I guess I could have rejected the drink but I felt bad because it was already made"
5/29/2018,5,The food here is amazing and quick. The employees are always professional. This is one of my favorite places to eat with family and friends.
5/25/2015,4,"Reliably good sushi for fair prices. Happy hour prices go from 4-7, and during that time you can get buy two get one free rolls! I go, load up on eel rolls, and leave a happy camper. I haven't had luck with their fried dumplings, they always come out a little hard. But their sushi rice is on point, which is more than I can say for some places around here."
8/30/2015,5,"First reaction when walking in... Casual, friendly staff and a relax ambiance. Great option if you are in the mood to grab and go or enjoy a relaxing afternoon/evening. Recommend the Mount Fuji roll and the bento box give you a variety of options to choose from."
8/4/2018,5,"Come on a regular basis. Quick, fresh, and inexpensive quality food. Walk up service for lunch and table service for dinner. Usually busy but worth the wait."
10/11/2018,5,Boba!!! My very first time drinking this amazingness of popping flavor! Say whhhat!! Def coming back for this delish beverage!
3/18/2015,3,"Took a trip to Bento Cafe as it was the closest ""decent"" Asian place from the conference hotel we were staying at.  To get the full ""asian experience,"" I tried the dumplings, sushi, pad thai and bubble tea.  The dumplings were average and tasted store bought.  I ordered them fried and the whole thing was deep fried giving it an oily and crispy-ish taste.  i definitely prefer my dumplings to be pan fried so it wasn't for me.The sushi was decent.  I ordered the eel and they did not skimp on the eel.  Pretty decent choiceThe strangest part of the meal was the pad thai - the noodles were not the rice noodles that i'd expect and I hardly tasted the fish sauce.  Instead it was a combination of soy and lemon?  I wouldn't want that again.The bubble tea was the best part of the meal.  Tea based, and good texture and sweetness on the bubbles.  A solid three stars."
12/23/2013,5,"I came here to eat with my girlfriend for lunch one day. And can I just say that I love this place? The atmosphere felt great and very welcoming. The staff seems very friendly and attentive. During the weekdays, they have a special called the Sushi Combo Box, I believe, ad it's basically four California Rolls, and then your choice of two different rolls, both four a piece. So a total of 12 for about $10. We also had Milk Tea with Pearls (Boba), also very good. We've decided to make this our new regular place to eat."
4/8/2018,5,"Bento has become a favorite of mine over the years. The food is prepared fresh and is always delicious. They are responsive to requests and the staff is always respectful. Whether I order their sushi, boba, or noodle bowls, I'm never disappointed. I also like the casual vibe of the restaurant. It's a great place to bring friends and family."
6/3/2015,5,I love the beef bulgogi!! The chicken katsu is really good as well. I always get the bento box special. I asked for extra vegetables instead of the salad. I'm not a fan of ginger dressing. I love the tempura green beans. There's always a little piece of cake too! The service is fast and friendly. It's cheap and the decor is really nice!
7/1/2018,4,Had to drop this to 4 stars as I was hassled about using this yelp check in bonus to get my appetizer. I've checked into here dozens of times and always get the edamame and this time I'm told I will be charged extra and that it's always been that way? I'm not one to make up things to save a few bucks. I'm too tired after a long day to continue to argue with these people.
3/13/2012,4,"This became an instant favorite the first time I came here. The check-in offer of a free appetizer with $10 purchase didn't hurt either. The appetizer that my friend and I settled on was the Steam Chicken Dumplings. As a dumpling fanatic, I was quite impressed and the sauce they were sitting in was delicious.So far, I've had the Soy Chili Chicken Noodle bowl and the Spicy Korean Beef Bento Box. Both were great and a good portion-size for less than $10 each. It's definitely a great value for what you're getting. I haven't had the sushi so I'm unable to comment on that, but the service and atmosphere are great. It might be lacking a bit of authenticity as far as Asian cuisine goes, but I think the intent is Pan-Asian fusion. In that respect, it certainly succeeds.When it's all said and done, this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck places in Orlando. If you have a craving for good Pan-Asian cuisine that won't break the bank, I highly recommend checking this place out if you haven't already."
5/10/2015,5,"Without a doubt my favorite Asian food place! The best sushi and prices around, plus very friendly wait staff.  They have a normal sushi happy hour m-f 4-7pm where you buy two rolls, get one free. This plus the garlic edamame is always a great filler for two, even the wok fried dumplings if you want a bit of a kick !The mt.fuji roll, special Mexican, Gucci roll and create a roll (seriously, make your own sushi!), are among our favorites. The Korean noodle bowl and spicy cream bowl are also amazing options to grab. If you're In a hurry, the bento box (sushi or entree version ) are a great way to get some great samples of everything this place has to offer.I never pass up a chance to get good sushi, and this place really knows what their doing, along with a great staff that know their menu! This has been a long favorite place of mine and will always be a staple in my go to places."
10/27/2015,5,"Good sushi at a good price?! Hard to find, but this place is it.We come usually for happy hour, or dinner take out. Both instances the place is great. First, their happy hour is full of options from 2 for 1 sushi, free appetizers, and drink specials. The sushi is really well presented, and we'll made. Not too big or small of a bite. Definitively a good, quick spot to get sushi."
6/6/2018,5,Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. The cuisine is pan-Asian and the menu consists of all kinds of cooked and raw foods. I ordered a bento combo box. The sushi quality exceeds the price. Service was also really friendly and quick. This is one of my favorite casual pan-Asian restaurants in Orlando!
12/30/2017,4,This is a really nice restaurant both to do as dine-in but also as Uber Eats. Great restaurant with good food and really nice staff. The sushi is really good and decently priced. The chicken curry wasn't really my thing (but I'm picky on curry). Definitely worth a try if you haven't been
11/8/2014,4,"Great spot to go for Asian food, I love their sushi rolls and bento boxes. You have to try the spicy creamy chicken, you won't regret it. I almost always get it. Don't forget to have some sake with your meal!"
12/1/2016,1,"I have been to this place many times and have always had a fantastic experience. Recently, I went and I ordered my Ahi Tuna, which normally takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the table. This time, it was at my table just two minutes after I sat down, which most would think is great service, but looking back makes me think it had been sitting out for someone else. Fast forward 4 hours - I am violently ill with food poisoning. I am not one to complain. I called their management to let them know, I don't even want compensation, just acknowledgment that they will look into it. They said someone would be in touch, and three days later, I have still heard nothing from them. Goes to show how seriously they take things like this..."
5/2/2018,5,Always love coming here. The sushi is great and the customizable meals are the best at a great price. Oh and if you love boba tea come here on Tuesdays for buy one get one! Also big shoutout to Echo who made date night with my boyfriend amazing. She was super attentive and gave great suggestions on teas. Highly recommend!
8/25/2019,4,"Took my family to Orlando for vacation. Found this place on yelp. It was pretty nice. Food was good. Quantity was good. Price was good. You order, pay and then find your own seat."
9/26/2019,5,Katie really made my first experience at Bento's amazing. She was extremely welcoming and helpful with the menu. Her service went beyond standards and her energy is too high to just be behind a counter. The food wasn't that delicious but this interaction made up for it. Thank you!
1/21/2015,5,"It can be very crowded at night, around wkds the wait is usually at least half an hour. But it's all worthwhile for my absolute fav dish: spicy cream chicken!!!"
8/18/2019,1,This has really gone down hill. Came in for dinner. So disappointing tables and floor was filthy. Employees not cleaning areas. Couldn't find a seat that was clean to eat. Use to be a great clean place..
1/6/2015,4,"Every time I've been here, it's always been take out so I can't comment on service. Their spicy cream chicken is heaven in your mouth. I always pay for extra with my white rice because I feel like what it comes with as is isn't as satisfying.I usually get Thai tea boba (no slush here)& it's usually good. However, one time, this girl must have been new because she made my tea where my condensed milk was literally floating in the top and just chillin' at the bottom of it. When I asked why it looked like that, some guy said ""we changed the 'formula'"". When really, she probably but the ice in before the milk so it couldn't dissolve. I took a sip of all condensed milk and I asked for a different drink and she had attitude but I already put money in the tip jar so I wasn't going to leave without a well-made drink. Royale tea was okay, but again, careful who makes your tea."
5/8/2019,2,"I really hate to write this negative review because as far as food goes it's a solid 4! Very yummy and flavorful dishes! However yesterday my husband and I decided to go on a lunch date here. The girl at the register (dirty blonde hair in a side braid, I don't know her name) was nasty rude. I have a service dog, he is an alert dog to PTSD episode that cause me to black out of conciseness something I shouldn't have to explain. He is very vital for me being able to go out and function. Well before we can even begin to order she gives me this incredibly dirty look and asks ""you're sitting on the patio correct?"". My husband jumps in to respond no we are going to take a booth inside. I also add he is a service dog. She then continues her dirty glares as we order. Making me feel very uncomfortable. I sit down and notice other employees are also giving me dirty looks. It's very hard for me to go out in public and to be treated like this is just unacceptable and heart breaking. I truly hope this review is taken seriously and training is put in place so that this treatment is not continued. But on another note I want to say Kelly who delivered our food is an absolute delight! She is so friendly and bubbly! Just a wonderful shinning light! Maybe she can teach the others how to conduct themselves in a customer service based setting. She deserves a raise!"
5/30/2019,5,"I was really in the mood for ramen during my visit to Orlando, but everything was so far or closed at that time of night. I was in the mood to try something new. I decided on sushi instead and came across Bento. I ordered a Japanese Bagel roll and a bento box (coconut curry chicken, white rice, ginger salad, and green beans). Everything was sooo good especially the coconut curry chicken!"
10/30/2012,4,This bento is a bit more fancier than the one in Gainesville yet a little more causal than the one located downtown. The food was still pretty good. When I went it wasn't busy so I had no problem with not getting any help. It's a very modern cafe with a cool vibe of a modern and traditional japanese restaurant.The food was pretty good and I think the servings are always hefty. I love getting the bento box because there's such a variation of things to eat and absolutely love the green beans! The garlic edamame is pretty darn good too but it's very strong and garlicy!
7/11/2017,5,"Tons of delicious options (including vegan) with prompt, friendly service. Jade provides exceptional customer service, even if you're placing a catering order."
11/18/2017,5,"I don't get to come here often but when I do it's an absolute delight. The food and tea are wonderful (I'm a tea/boba snob) and it passed my tests. The service goes above expectations. I always forget to order my food without onions and when I made a comment about it, like ""oops, I forgot again."" a server (Winderson) was incredibly helpful in getting the food remade even as I said to not let it be an inconvenience. Always excited to come here!"
7/31/2016,1,Extremely slow service and they weren't even busy.   Would not return here.   The chicken was overcooked and the sauce/curry was not spicy enough.
7/27/2015,5,"Hands down, one of the best sushi quality I've had. The menu has a great selection of appetizers, sushi rolls, entrees, and teas. And for the price, you can't beat it! Definitely visiting this place again. Overall very modern, clean and friendly staff; that's always a plus!!"
7/13/2019,1,"Consistently slow and terrible service, regardless of when you come. It's Saturday, just past 3 pm (so there's neither a lunch or a dinner rush) and the restaurant is empty. After more than 10 minutes of waiting for just my hot tea, I went to ask why it was taking so long. The woman working the food line told me rather rudely that she couldn't find me and that's why I didn't have my tea. That's strange, because I received a number to take to my table, so they clearly just didn't bother to look. By this time, my hot tea was room temperature. My food order, which was one dish that didn't require cooking, came 25 minutes after my order was placed. Why it took so long when the place is empty and there are three sushi chefs working, I don't know. But this basically happens every time I come here. I tried calling in my order ahead, but good luck with that. They just say please hold, and put you on hold before you can say anything. I ended up holding for more than 5 minutes each time, and no one came back on the line to take my order. So I just went somewhere else those times because I couldn't be bothered. It's like the management here just doesn't want to make money, because these are easy fixes, and would prevent them from losing customers. This is my last time here."
8/31/2017,3,"A decent asian fast food place. I ordered a customized poke bowl, it was pretty good. Although they gave me too much soy and it was a little bit too salty."
1/27/2018,1,"Looked online and checked they were open and would close at 11pm, wanted a delivery so I decided to try Uber eats, was placing my order and had already chosen a few items, when suddenly at 10:12 the app was not accepting orders for this restaurant anymore. Called the restaurant and they said they turned off the app because it was close to closing time, seriously? Then why say you receive orders till 11pm on the app? VERY DISAPOINTED"
1/24/2018,4,"I'm here at least once a week for lunch, sometimes there is hardly a wait and others you wait 30 minutes. The main reason this review is 4 stars is frequently during the lunch rush they run out of forks. Seems like a crazy problem for a place that knows they will have a lunch rush. Highly recommend the food. I love the sushi, they are accommodating for any substitution of protein. I also really enjoy the pad Thai but the portion is huge it usually gets me lunch and dinner."
2/15/2015,5,"Came here for lunch with coworkers to celebrate Valentine's Day. Their sushi lunch special is two classic rolls, a California roll, seaweed salad, and a cucumber salad thing for $8.95. Not a bad deal at all! I got the krab delight and Alaskan rolls and I was happy overall with my purchase. What surprised me was how many options there are with all of the different Asian flavors. We all got something different: one got curry, one got a rice bowl of sorts with raw salmon, several got the sushi special, and one got another bowl of sorts. There's no shortage of options and it seems that the prices are comparable to other sushi places.  I feel like I got a bit more bang for my buck here though bc I ended up with 12 pieces of sushi in the special, whereas most places I get 8-10 if I'm lucky. I will be back again to bring my SO along!"
8/27/2015,3,"Pretty good. Ordered the bulgogi noodle bowl. Arrived warm, not hot. The beans were overcooked and cold. The noodles were greasy like you get a little dumpy Chinese place in a bad strip mall. The bulgogi beef was really good. More of that sauce/marinade should have been on the noodles. Got beef fried rice. Meh. Underwhelming.Pros:- bulgogi good- open later then Pei Wei- reasonable price (if you don't want to sub fried in for white rice)- comfortable atmosphere (NOT posh, as another reviewer mentions)Cons:- cold food- overcooked veggies- not enough bulgogi sauce- meh fried riceSome of these issues could just be the night (like cold food), but on a previous visit we got cold overcooked edamame)."
10/13/2017,5,Nicole was a fantastic server. Really enjoyed our meal. I'm gluten intolerant and Nicole was super great about making sure nothing I got had gluten in it.
12/31/2017,3,I was very disappointed with visiting my favorite restaurant while i was on vacation. I went two times within a 4 day period just because its my favorite restaurant. The first time i went i waited over an hour for my food. Sushi was left out so the rice was mushy and no good. I got my spicy kream bowl and was a decent bowl but not enough shrimp. The second time i went i was disappointed with the teriyaki steak noodle bowl. The steak was too chewy and the teriyaki was too runny and didn't stick to the steak.
5/21/2014,5,"Absolutely love Bento Cafe!! Between the fun and trendy atmosphere, extensive (and very delicious) menu offerings, reasonable pricing, generous portions, and friendly service - I highly recommend this restaurant!Some of my faves are fried chicken dumplings, Cantonese pork chop on rice, Szechuan beef noodle soup, Mt. Fuji roll, salmon skin roll, dragon roll, thrilla in manila kawaii roll, and don't forget the taro milk tea with pearls.The Yelp check-in offer is just the cherry on top :)."
3/30/2015,5,"I've been coming to Bento Cafe for years - since they opened! I'm not ashamed to say that I always get the same items every time I come. They've been so consistent throughout the years. I highly recommend the dumplings! So delicious and piping hot, fried or steamed. Probably the best in Orlando. The shrimp tempura rice bowl is my go-to dish; very filling. My favorite sushi rolls are the Mt. Fuji and the Masarap (which means delicious in Tagalog). It is usually quick casual for lunch and they switch to table service for dinner. Get there during happy hour for their 'buy 2 rolls and get 1 free' promo. But do try to finish it because you can't take leftover happy hour sushi home. I tried :(Yes, it can get crowded on some nights so expect a wait on the sushi. One night we came, our server warned us upfront that the wait for sushi was 45 minutes, which was insane but it was a Saturday night. At least we were warned.Everything is reasonably priced and service is always satisfactory. I will continue to come back!"
8/20/2017,4,Good food. I would recommend the spicy creamy chicken. Order was messed up but the server apologized and made it better.
4/29/2017,5,"Great sushi! Service is good, and normally you don't have to wait long for your order. Lunch is counter service, dinner and Sunday lunch is table service.  I recommend the sushi combo box- the Mt Fuji roll and Special Mexican roll are my favorites. I've also had the sweet and sour chicken bowl and that was delicious too!  Give it a try. My only criticism is I wish they opened before noon!  No sushi lunch at 11:30 ."
5/30/2014,4,"I had wonderful service when I came here. As a sushi snob, I liked that I was able to create my own roll with a combination of ingredients that fit my taste buds. If you're like me and tend to be picky with your sushi rolls, I recommend you to do the same - make your own roll."
10/9/2017,5,Had my first ever poke bowl from there- it was excellent. The tuna was fresh and flavorful. I also enjoyed that you can order half rolls of sushi. Great quality- especially for the price.
1/3/2017,3,"Not the best but not the worst.  Definitely a ""fast food"" style of sushi.  For families / friends with sushi-leary kids/friends, the menu includes noodle and rice heavy meal bowls too.  The restaurant itself was clean and organized.  If you are looking for super casual mixed Asian style fast-fare, this is your place.  If you are looking for a high quality sushi experience, skip it."
3/26/2017,5,Fav casual place for sushi . Lunch is run much better then dinner . I like ordering at counter and then picking where I would like to sit . Usually a waiting list for dinner . The food is good overall and reasonable prices
8/27/2011,3,"Bento Cafe sets the tone for an urban and contemporary cafe which serves quick casual sushi and Pan Asian Cuisine. The interior is very modern with tones of black and red. There are striking red columns hanging from the high ceiling. The side tables have a beautiful calming inserted glass box with rocks and petals.  There is the proverbial sushi cases and a corner counter dedicate for take out.Upon entry there is an empty greeter stand with quite a few staff walking around. A less than excited staff walked over nonchalantly, grabbed menus, and motioned to follow. What if we just wanted take out? Picky, picky. For a place with such a high server to table ratio, it took forever for a server to greet us. While there were several staff standing around more interested in their own bubble than a guest. When the server did decide to come over, she was cordial but very impersonal. She did offer to explain the menu. But when asked for a menu item that defined Bento Cafe, the standard non familiar answer of ""they are all good"" flew out of her mouth. Although it was early evening of a weekend day, it did not seem like anyone was really happy to be there. No smiles nor acknowledgments.The sushi rice was soft, mushy, and extra sticky. Sushi roll pieces stuck together. Sashimi were still cold in the middle. The fish was not sliced completely through as they hung together. The ""white fish"" or tilapia blood line was not removed leaving that all too familiar fishy odor. The booba balls were a mixture of fresh and not so fresh, some were chewy while others were little rocks. The glass of Moscato di Asti was completely flat.For the price and swanky neighborhood, this place should deliver a higher caliber of food and service. Not because the restaurant is billed as ""quick casual"" it means ""quick sloppy"". There are still certain basic elements of service and food preparation that should follow any restaurant. Especially in a sushi restaurant."
5/8/2019,2,Came here 7-10 times before and checked in and received a free small appetizer and today now I guess the rule has changed. You must dine-in to receive the free 3.00 Appetizer....
4/12/2017,4,This was great for a casual date night. I really enjoyed my food and the vibe the place has . Will definitely be back!
11/8/2015,5,"Delicious! We come here all the time. I love their boba and rice bowls!! The service is good, but come on a sunday or a weekday if you want to avoid a crowd. It  is a very popular place, and the wait can be awhile if it is a busy night. They do have takeout as well, if you need to order quickly."
10/29/2017,5,"I consistently love this place and come every few weeks. They are great for lunch and dinner. I enjoy their sushi and rice bowls; noodle bowls, bento boxes and poke are available too. I have their crab wontons app every time I'm there and they never disappoint. The beef bulgogi is frequent choice of mine and I love it. You can get only 4 sushi rolls with some varietys (or 8 or 10 with all), which is nice as a light meal, app, or if you just want a taste. Prices for everything are totally reasonable and sometimes they have coupons with Yelp. Dinner has servers and is full service, while lunch is more fast casual. They do takeout too. You can get brown rice if you want - for bowls or sushi. Service is OK; sometimes they get bogged down if busy, but they definitely take care of you. Absolutely recommend to anyone liking Asian food."
11/25/2014,4,"You can't beat this place. The food is great, fast, cheap and good service. The bento box is recommended. Salad, your choice of meat, noodles, rice, a vegetable (usually broccoli or green beans) then a small dessert. Sometimes you seat yourself and order at the counter and they bring you the food and you get your own drinks, or it is full table service. I generally see the table service come into play around dinner time.... However there doesn't seem to be too much consistency as I have had both at all different times. REGARDLESS - who cares right? It's a restaurant. We are there for good food. You won't be disappointed."
9/25/2014,3,"A true fusion restaurant.  It sounds like a Japanese spot until you look at the menu.  They have serve Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food.  I am not a fan of fusion restaurants, but this was the only place that opened late.The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nice.  There were TVs everywhere and the football game was on (BONUS).  Keep in mind that I was getting over a fever and all I  wanted was some noodle soup to make myself feel better.  If you check in via yelp, you get a free appetizer with purchase of $10 or more.  Kelly ordered the teriyaki bento box and I ordered a spicy beef noodle soup (basically a pho).  I feel that teriyaki bento box is pretty standard anywhere you go.  Nothing to brag about.  The spicy beef noodle soup was pretty good.  The soup was flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  I asked for ramen noodle with it and there was an up charge for it. that was fine. The food was not bad at all. It was much needed since the only thing I hate that day was medicine and water.I wish I had the stomach to try some sashimi and check out the quality. Oh well."
3/11/2016,5,very good inexpensive food. used yelp coupon to get free Gyoza (Pork dumplings)
7/21/2014,3,"The service was ok. The restaurant was on the louder side, which the server did not compensate for. So, when he spoke, I would have to lean in a bit more. However, the food was good. The Edamame was a bit surprising with the salt added onto the shell. I had the Rainbow Roll, which was satisfying. I would suggest it, perhaps earlier in the day."
6/5/2014,1,"Says check in for $10 off but their free Wifi doesn't work and when you ask they just tell you their must be too many people on when clearly not one person has their phone out.   They increased their prices without changing their menus and when confronted with it they just said it was an error on the menu. SO FIX IT!!  Then the server brought out my companions food, took the table # and apparently left mine sitting for pick up until 20 min later when I asked where mine was. All I got was a sorry.  One of the worst service experiences I have ever encountered. There are better sushi places on restaurant row. I would skip this one if I were you."
1/19/2014,1,"I haven't tried the food but the bobba teas are powdered grossness. I love bobba and thought I'd try a new place. When I arrived, I was excited to see the variety on their menu. I was at once disappointed though to see them scooping powders to mix my strawberry shortcake. Although I still planned to drink it, one sip changed my mind. Tasted like too many scoops of Nestle quick. Yuck!"
12/19/2015,1,"Update 12/22: The district manager contacted me and resolved the issue. Though I wouldn't return to this location, Bento usually delivers stellar service at any of its other locations. Looking forward to a better experience.Original review: Though the wait was very minimal and we got sat quickly, the rest is short of a nightmare. The reason we came to this restaurant was because of Yelp offer and the hot sake! However, upon sitting down and asking for hot sake, we were told they were out. So we asked to have Kirin light, which turns out they didn't have. We settled for the Kirin Ichiban. We ordered a Philly roll and asked that smoked salmon be changed to regular salmon. She took the order and then came back and said there was going to be an up-charge. Though any other time I would've been okay with it, I felt appalled that after being inconvenienced twice it should at least be disregarded. I called for the manager, which came in a hostile disposition. She had her hands folded and looked like she was gonna cry from the irate look on her face. I explained the confusion and she mentioned that it was company policy and that the least she could do is discount the beer... (Side note the discount for the beer would've been the same as the up-charge...I digress). But right after she mentioned, ""you threaten the server"", appalled I responded, ""I did what?"", she responded, ""you told the staff that you were going to review us on Yelp"". I clarified, ""that is not a threat, that is what I usually do when I go to a restaurant""... Make a long story short at the end she said, ""We target a certain type of customers and you may not be one of them"". With that said we requested to leave and she said don't worry about the beer, that were barely drank! Overall, the manager could've handled the situation so much better. Her calling a review a threat was beyond ridiculous, people review, that's not a threat but a fact. Her initial interaction and her final remarks were both unprofessional and quite derogatory. The offer to discount the beer would've been suffice however her emotions lead the conversation which prompted this lovely review. I hope for future patrons, you are able to coach to your teams ability to identify a threat and how to better handle customers who are not pleased with the service. Manager: Andrein"
8/4/2015,5,Love sushi I will come back any day againI had a nice visit this timeI'm so happy I give it a second chance I can't complain this time .........................
2/1/2015,5,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner despite the service reviews and we were pleasantly surprised. This was the first time at this restaurant for the both of us and everything was great from the food to the service. He had a teriyaki beef bento box, I had the shrimp tempura on a rice bowl and we split a sushi combo box - it was A LOT of food (very generous portions) for a great price. All in all we will definitely be visiting again. Great food, service and atmosphere."
11/21/2016,5,"So much to choose from, and such good sushi! I had the combo and it was the perfect amount of sushi for me. Can't wait to go back!"
2/18/2019,1,"Unprofessional treatment of customers and terrible attitude of so called ""manager"" Alex (to describe him more specifically: very unpleasant appearance with massive green piercing in his ears). I am a frequent customer who used to come to Bento almost every week for a year, and I've never been so disrespected. He overcharged me without even checking if the product is even available, which turned out that it wasn't, and then when I said ""don't worry about the refund - I'll be back next week and I'll just grab a bottle of water then."" He started telling me it's unrealistic, interrupted me, snapped and started raising his annoying voice being very sharp and disrespectful to me. Maybe he forgot that the customer is always right? Especially a very, very frequent one? I used to love Bento, but I now feel extremely disrespected and disappointed. For my own money, some uneducated person in customer service is interrupting, raising his voice, being rude and telling me he doesn't like me, especially after he made a mistake on top of everything! A manager doesn't act like this. He should be fired."
7/27/2019,3,"My boyfriend and I come to this place pretty often, and we noticed one of your staff that's a host, I think her name is Taylor. On July 27th @9:50pm, we ordered food to go, and the way she handled the call was very unprofessional. Not only did she not even actually put us on hold when she said she would, allowing us to hear everything she was gossiping about to her coworker; she also took a long time to confirm our order. She did not even properly end the call, just randomly hanging up without saying when the order could be picked up. When we picked up our order, and saw how much the bill was, and thinking about how she carelessly took our order over the phone, we seriously considered not tipping at all; we wound up tipping 18% to still be considerate. The last time that we ate there, she gave us a dirty look for no apparent reason when we ordered boba. We do feel like the quality of service is diminishing drastically at this location. We consider ourselves regular costumers, and as such we simply expect quality service from every employee. Please do take note of this!"
2/13/2019,5,Echo was the absolute best server ever! We were setting up our friend's first date and she helped us with it. Definitely 10/10 for maxing Guest Service!!
9/5/2016,4,Bento Cafe is an excellent choice for an Asian lunch if you are in the Dr. Phillip's area.  The sushi here knocks Publix sushi out of the park.  The only complaint is the combo doesn't include both miso soup and ginger salad.  I will be coming back soon.
1/6/2014,4,"Bento has never done me wrong! Their food is always on point, I've never had a negative experience here. There's not much of an ""experience"" when dining here, which is fine with me, I'm usually here for a quick meal or to meet up with friends before we head out somewhere else. It's perfect for a light but filling meal. My favorites: Fried cheese wantons, spicy tuna rolls, and the Volcano rolls.xx MJ"
3/5/2015,5,I love this place! Much better than downtown location if you ask me. The price is Great for the amazing cuisines that you get. Me and family's personal favorite dish is Spicy cream! Not spicy at all though for you spice lovers but it's awesome! My favorite Sushi roll is Mt.Fuji roll :-P
2/9/2016,2,"I normally like to go to Bento Cafe but today was one of those days where the employees were totally disorganized! Normally there are 2 cashiers at the order desk, one left and took a long time getting back. I asked the other guy where was the cashier because the line was getting long. He didn't answer. Then he forgot to give me my cup. Annoyed!"
1/13/2019,5,Jayson at Bento is great! Super sweet and accommodating. Wonderful service and absolutely love Bento's sushi! Always a good choice!
4/12/2017,5,I love this place. The atmosphere is relax. The quality of the food and quantity is great for the price. The food is fresh and delicious. Had lunch in different occasions and jad the bento box and sushi box. Both are amazing!
1/22/2017,3,"My BF and I have ordered the same exact order about twice a month for 2 years. We work from home around the corner, and we call it in and pick it up. The food is good, and we will continue to eat there, but the order is NEVER correct. It use to really irritate us, not its just comical. Not ONCE has our order ever been how we ordered it. I worked in the restaurant industry for 12 years, so I know a complicated order when I see it. Our order is nothing complicated.  I addressed this with the manager one time so she put our order together to make sure it was correct. Got home, and there's no soy sauce or chop sticks in the bag. Just funny at this point."
4/12/2016,5,I've been here a couple of times already and the food never disappoints. The food is always great and fresh. The garlic edamame is delicious. The creamy shrimp or chicken is yummy. The Siracha chicken is also great. The atmosphere is a great place to enjoy great food. I would definitely recommend this place. Great place for Asian food.
11/11/2013,3,"Bento Cafe has a great mix of Asian fusion that allows me to keep trying more and mroe delicious options however, the service doesn't really allow me to enjoy it as much as I like. Flip flopping between a quick service location and a table service experience - you never really know what to expect service wise from this location. Table service dining is usually a miss, multiple servers, ""auctioning"" of food, and entirely too slow delivery to the table. With all that being said, I haven't really tired anything I didn't like. I've even had my decent service nights, including one night where the server recommended a ""secret roll"" - the PB&J Roll - and WOW! What a sushi roll! This is my MUST order every time I dine here.Bento Cafe does offer a pretty decent happy hour for sushi with buy 2 rolls, get 1 free from 4-7 Monday through Friday. I would recommend checking it out, just make sure you're not under a time constraint."
6/6/2015,1,"Ordered  4 sushi rolls (fried). All four tasted like mud, the Panko was chewy and oily. No flavor whatsoever. The fried dumplings were old and freezer burnt.   ALPO would have tasted better. Big disappointment.  Won't be stopping by there again."
7/11/2015,3,"We've eaten here at Bento on many occassions.  With this restaurant it's truly hit and miss.  There have been times where the food and the service have been excellent and other times not so much.  We've been here when it's terribly busy and when it's not busy at all.We enjoy the sushi here and the price is decent.  They have a nice variety of choices not only for sushi but for Japanese and other Asian food.The service is ok but truly never excellent.  This visit was not so great.  The server was ok but when we told her my niece only wanted terriyaki chicken with the lo mein noodles with no vegetables she said ok and brought out the dish with cabbage mixed in the noodels.  We said something to her and her only resposne was, ""well the cabbage is already mixed in and they don't have those noodels without it.""  Well maybe when we told you she didn't want any vegetables you should have told us that at the time?!  Do you think?We didn't make a big deal out of it because we had already waited 55 minutes for our food and we were very hungry.  My poor 12 year old niece picked out that cabbage with each bite of food.I always get the Gucci roll which I find to be excellent.  This time is was ok, a little dry with the topping but still good.I definitely recommend this sushi restaurant but remember you never know exactly what the service will be like but the food is always consistenly good."
10/30/2017,3,"So this place is decent. I used to visit the downtown location a lot for lunch and this one is basically the same. The special Mexican roll and the create your own rolls are my favorite. I have had a few issues with this location. First, beware if you use a coupon, Yelp or otherwise. Many times they don't take the correct amount off and if you don't catch it you'll be paying for your ""free"" item. We've had to have this corrected many times. Second, they are not very accommodating to changes. Once I was able to do a create my own roll with mushrooms and after that I was always told no. The sushi chefs always refuse when it comes to changes. Lastly, (this has to with the create your own) I'm not sure many of the employees understand that when a customer asks if an ingredient can be used as something you chose from and they say yes, you shouldn't then be charged extra. They are really bad about telling you if something will cost extra, which again I've experienced many times simply bc I'm first told it's fine only to find out it's fine but costs more."
9/24/2016,5,Best place to come and hangout with friends the sushi is soooo good. The prices are very reasonable and ther Service is great.
4/11/2015,1,The men's bathroom ran out of hand soap and just saw a sushi chef come out of the bathroom and directly went back to his post on sushi line.
12/17/2018,1,Horrible hostesses and servers there. I stared at an empty dining room with my stomach growling for 25 minutes before I was seated. Only then to deal with atrocious attitudes from the servers that I dealt with. Food did not make up for it and my experience was overall very bad.
2/24/2017,5,"First timer, great customer service. Delicious tea my fav is the Thai tea, we went in for our  lunch break, food came out quickly and was able to get to work on time. Curry Katsu reminded me of my time in Japan."
2/24/2017,4,Great Lunch Spot. Favorite roll is special Mexican if you haven't tried it defiantly a must!
6/4/2014,3,"A really nice quick-Asian place with standard fare, pretty comparable to Pei-Wei.The prices are low, the food is sound, and the service is attentive. It really seems to me to be the clone of Pei-Wei which is essentially across the road.I've ordered the Udon Noodles, Red Curry, and Basil Chicken. The Udon Noodles are solid, but are tiring to eat considering they are ridiculously thick (as are all Udon Noodles). The Red Curry was pretty mediocre and I do not plan to ever order that dish again. The Basil Chicken on the other hand is solid, but has a certain taste to it that I cannot ascertain. It's an A-OK restaurant and that's pretty much all there is to it.I really enjoyed it the first time, but for me, the place got old fast. It may be because I attempted to eat here twice in one week, an event which I regret. I'll probably try it out a few more times in the future, but considering Pei Wei has a slight edge over Bento Cafe in my opinion, it will take a lot of effort to ditch that reliable restaurant. Still worth trying, and a place where you should consider enjoying a quick meal at."
12/15/2018,1,"Usually been very good BUT this time it was not. After 20 minutes of waiting and 2 groups that were in line after me were served, my wife went to ask and was told sushi was slow (her) but I didn't order sushi. Hers came out. Then people in the next booth were served-they we're not even in the building when I ordered but were served before me. When I finally got served the rice and shrimp tempura were both cold.not happy and will go to Bonsai Sushi on Doctor Phillips next time"
4/20/2013,3,"*I'd give it 3.5 stars.*Bento Café is a Pan-Asian restaurant chain with five locations, two of which are in Orlando.  I recently went to the Sand Lake location  with a group of friends for a birthday celebration.  I hadn't been here before because it didn't strike out to me as a place that I ""must try"".  Well, the birthday girl is raving about this place.  It was busy for a Friday night.  I liked the interior, the restaurant has a stylish modern look with red throughout.The menu is easy to order from.  You pick your entrée, the options are ""bento box"", ""noodle bowl"", or ""rice bowl"".  Then you select your protein and the style.  Easy enough and very customizable but so many choices.  Do I want to go more Chinese, Thai, or Japanese?  I just kept looking over the menu, up and down.  They also have a sushi menu that was priced reasonably.  I ordered the Fried Cheese Wontons and the Basil Chicken Noodle Bowl.  The Fried Cheese Wontons ($3.75) were really good.  Not too heavy tasting as far as the cream cheese goes, and the sauce on the side was tasty. I definitely didn't share these.Next, I had the Basil Chicken Noodle Bowl ($7.75).  It had chicken, noodles, basil, onions, carrots and a kung pao sauce.  I was craving some extra veggies, so I added broccoli.  If you order this, have them make it spicy.  You'll thank me for this.  Great tasting flavor, fresh vegetables, it's actually good.  The noodle bowl is a good portion size.  I tasted the Beef Bulgogi, it was decent too.  (Although for me it wasn't as flavorful as I've had in Korean restaurants.)Bento Café has boba (which is a flavored drink with tapioca pearls). Food-wise, I was surprised and enjoyed it.  Great flavors, good portions.  Service-wise, I do think they need some work.  The servers did not handle a large group well.  Some of people in the group showed up much much later and received their food before I did.  Luckily, I wasn't terribly hungry or else I would've gone into She-Hulk mode.  One of my friends waited awhile for her seaweed salad.  Seriously?  It's seaweed salad.  I'd come back but with a smaller party.All in all, it's in a great location, lots to choose from and you'll leave here full.  If you're just craving Asian food but can't decide, Bento Café is a good go-to option."
7/9/2014,3,"To start off we had the pork dumplings which were amazing! In a very mild spicy sauce that I've never had paired with dumplings . Next we had the Gucci roll and the udon noodle bowl with beef. Both were very good!! Totally would recommend. I don't like the process. You first have to pay for your meal and then they serve . Very different. Also, you don't get a personal connection with the ""server"". They're more like food runners. Very odd.Food= 4 stars Atmosphere and service = 3"
8/25/2018,4,"I love it! Awesome food, didn't wait for long, employees were amazing and the atmosphere was great."
11/11/2016,5,"Love the food here! Been going for years. The spicy cream sauce is delicious!!! However, it can get a little crazy at lunch and a little under staffed."
11/11/2014,4,Very casual place for some inexpensive sushi that is still very yummy!  My favorite rolls are the Special Mexican Roll and the Bali Hai Mango Roll. It usually takes them 10 minutes to make the rolls.Try it out if you like sushi!
6/10/2014,4,"Excellent food. Tasty, spicy if you want that. Good Japanese and street food. Service is a bit off sometimes. But overall good and reliable. Access is sometimes tough from Sandlake Rd if coming from West."
7/28/2016,2,Food is good but attitude here isn't  the office called in two different times for tool order and instead of adding to existing order they stated a new one.  When I went to pay I asked them to combine the checks and the manager told me she couldbt
3/26/2014,4,"I went here about a week ago and I had shrimp tempura bowl and an apple milk drink with lychee. The shrimp tempura bowl consisted of 3 pieces of shrimp tempura, white rice, and Broccoli. The price of the bowl was under $8 bucks and the drink was about $4.25 I think for the large size. The food it self was amazing well cooked very tasty!!! I grabbed an take out menu because I know I will eat here again. There are some cons tho, when eating there they had a slight nat problems I had to swat nats away from my food, and so did my friends. Plus parking can be a little troublesome. But overall the food is soooo gooooddd here!!!"
11/11/2009,4,"Bento's in Orlando is always raved about by Bento fans. They claim it is tons better than Bento's in Gainesville (which I have had in the past). I'm not sure about the other location in Orlando, but this one was about the same in taste. I ordered their sushi combo which was reasonably priced, but not really a steal either. The sushi was fresh and I really enjoyed the cucumbers they put into it (my friends enjoyed the seaweed salad that came in the bento box as well). The place is located in a really nice plaza and I wasn't disappointed with the service, so I would certainly stop by here again if I am in the area."
9/3/2011,4,"I lived on Bento throughout my college career in Gainesville and have been a fan since!Bento is a Pan-Asian restaurant so their menu offers a variety of different dishes. Some of my favorites off their menu are the Thai Coconut Curry, Bulgogi, Udon Stir-Fry, and the Curry Katsu.They also serve sushi and you will find a large selection of different sushi rolls on the menu, too. My favorite sushi roll has always been the Red Dragon which has shrimp tempura inside and fresh tuna on top. I would also recommend the Bali Hai roll. This sushi roll is a bit sweeter because it is topped with mango, coconut flakes, and eel sauce.The food is good, prices are cheap, and servers are attentive and friendly.Another plus, they have boba teas!!"
4/3/2010,3,"Ok so for this location I decided to visit multiple times before coming out with a verdict. I really like the red themed, asian fusion cafe type of vibe they produced with the decor and rocks inside the tables. The bento boxes and bobas teas are sooooo good. Bento boxes consist of your choice of savourful chicken or beef, moist rice, seasoned noodles, and a tiny itty bitty coffee cake. Balance is key and the bento boxes served it up...Boba lovers note:**On tuesday nights there is Happy hour for boba teas 2-4-1 ::high five:: they make happy hour for these yummyful drinks!** The milk teas here are almost as good as Lollycups..They use almost the same theme of corney animated cups with a huge boba sucking straw. With similiar tasting syrups and creamy all around goodness.::YAYYY::Now here comes some things that need work, because I believe this place could be the best it can with some simple clarification...If a menu was posted up on their website for the Orlando location it would be helpful upon entering. The rushed feeling of having to pick the first thing your eyes like because there is a line behind you of hungry bento lovers can be regretful. Do we tip before or after the meal?Is this a place that you have to clean up or the waiters do it for you?The service and ordering got me slightly lost...customers need a sense of direction..I noticed from previous reviews other people said the same thing about the Dr. Phillips location; the unconsistent service can be confusing. They have the potential to get more stars than deserving.(But you must try their boba.... the people at this place can curse me out, service me 30 mins late but I still need their addicting boba teas regardless lol. If u try one u might feel the same way!)"
2/5/2014,4,"Good environment, good food, and good service!Food could of been a little better but the experience overall was pretty good"
3/20/2012,3,"Overall 3.5 starsSERVICE: 3.5/5-sushi chefs were slow. We only ordered three rolls. Took over 20 mins. FOOD: 4/5-MT. FUJI: topped with krab. The first thing you taste is the krab , followed by the shrimp tempura and finally the eel sauce & rice. -SURF N KAWAII: :light and not heavy. Rice paper over lettuce with tuna, krab, shrimp tempura and avocado. Ingredients were imitation, shrimp tempura, tuna, avocado-ENVY: salmon, tuna, imitation crab, avocado topped with kiwi and masago topped with sweet chili sauce. All I could taste was rice and the flavor, not the avocado, krab or tuna :(-Chicken Fried Dumpling (free after one yelp check in)"
5/26/2012,1,"This place is extremely busy when we arrived.  There was a small waiting area and the there was no hostess to help speed things along.  After watching the waitress, possible half Asian, run around trying to clear tables, she comes back to ask who us next, but she is attempting to avoid the people who was actually next and begins to ask the last set of guest that entered.  I told the waitress that the lady ahead of me was actually next.  After directing the lady, who was before me, the waitress came back to the guests that came after me.  I rudely interrupted the waitress to tell her again that I am next.  This no-good waitress sat the guest that came after me at the bar then came back to sit me at my table.  I don't care what crappy school of etiquette you went to but you never sit anyone that came after before someone that came before, even if it is the President of the United States of America.   Businesses strive to have returning customers and this business lost me.The service is crap and the food is crappier.  The sushi rice is mushy and just way too wet.  It had no seasoning to it, just  mushy blobs of rice stuck on seaweed paper.  Everything here is based on a California roll.  They change the toppings and give it a different name.  They overuse Krab.  Yes, K-crab, the Pollock fish, shaped and colored to imitate crab.  Their rolls are not tight and every time I went to pick up a piece, stuff fell out of them.  The sashimi platter was a hit and miss.  They had some pieces that tasted fresh and there was pieces that would have been better if they used the correct knife to cut so there would be no steel aftertaste.  The pieces were cut into varying size pieces here. I personally feel that the pieces that were thinner and cut against the grain tasted better than the thick chunk pieces.I was extremely disappointed in the boba teas.  The waitress said that they are more a smoothie consistency because there is milk in it.  What a lie!!!!  It was not a smoothie consistency.  It was more like iced coffee consistency, loose and milky.Added later:My toddler was spitting out the boba from the boba tea so I waved down the closest wait staff member.   The young black male looked at me as if I was crazy to ask him for extra napkins!  I gave him a crazy look back, since I was making the most off the wall request.  I never in my life experience that reaction for asking for more napkins."
5/1/2013,4,"I like the variety of Bento Cafe, so I continue to come here. And it's the only place around that I can find Boba tea.On weekends they seat you and you have table service, otherwise it's order at the cash register and then take a seat. I have tried different things here and there and nothing amazing yet. The menu is so diverse, I have fun trying new things. Worth a shot.I have not tried their sushi there. I do that down the street at Seito, so I come to Bento Cafe for the variety of non-sushi related dishes."
2/27/2015,1,"Just sat for 15 full minutes in Bento Cafe (which has MAYBE 18 tables, tops) without a server even looking in our direction. There were servers standing around DELIBERATELY avoiding eye-contact with our table, obviously playing ""not-it"". When two tables seated after us were attended to before we were even greeted, we decided to leave. When we complained on our way out, the servers and seater just stared, stone-faced. They didn't even apologize. Avoid this place. Utterly unacceptable."
11/15/2015,4,Good service and great sushi. Not amazing sushi but for the price totally worth it. I will be going back soon.
4/12/2013,4,"I was in the mood for sushi and decided to try Bento Cafe since I was in the area. It took me a little while to become acquainted with the menu and decide what to order, and since it's counter service, it took me a bit of extra time. I decided on the Florida Roll (Tuna, salmon, and avocado) and the chicken tempura roll. Since Yelp gives you a free appetizer when you check in, I went for some garlic edamame. The sushi rolls were delicious and very tasty. I loved the Florida roll since it gave me the raw tuna I was craving, and the Chicken Tempura roll was awesome for those who may not be into the raw fish but want the sushi experience. It comes with sweet eel sauce drizzled over it and is absolute perfection. I'd have it again. The only complaint I have is the garlic edamame. I've had garlic edamame at other restaurants and it is usually combined with some other flavor, like lime. However, this edamame was garlic and ONLY garlic. Too much raw garlic. It was so overwhelming that I couldn't really eat much of it. I will say that they give you a ton for a low price (and mine was free, so that's even better), so that's a nice thing. Overall, I'd definitely come here again."
4/24/2016,5,"I stopped here a few weeks ago when I was in town for work, and then I happened to be back in Orlando for work again this week. It was good then, and good now. Memorable enough to warrant a second visit. The first time I was here was on a weekday around lunchtime and I placed my order at the counter and the food was brought to our table when it was ready. I'm here this time on a weekend and there is table service. I think they have table service on the weekends and evenings.  I had the yellow curry both times. First was a bento box, this time was a rice bowl. I preferred the variety of the bento box and would get that next time. The chicken was very tender. I also had the Special Mexican Roll this time and it was fantastic. The shrimp tempura was nice and crispy, which I appreciate in a shrimp tempura roll. They were unfortunately making another batch of boba when I ordered, so instead of waiting 15 minutes for it to get done, I ordered a different bubble tea with passion fruit jelly. I'm normally a lychee sort of girl, but they were out of that as well. Server was prompt, nice, and attentive, and helpful when I asked for suggestions. This will be a place I'd stop in again whenever I come through Orlando."
11/30/2017,5,First time here and it was a great experience. Great concept with the bento box!! Great atmosphere and my server Melissa was very sweet and attentive. I had the Pad Thai and my cousin had the Bento Box. Both were extremely filling and well made and we even tried a sushi roll which was very well made. Will definitely be back
4/22/2014,5,"I want to live and die here.Favorite sushi - the special mexican roll, and the Mt. Fuju roll.If you are getting a Bento Box, the spicy cream chicken is amazing.The staff is generally very friendly.  I'll never forget Halloween when a Power Ranger was there."
4/17/2013,4,"I absolutely love Bento Cafe, except that almost every time I am there they are out of something that I want, usually the Mocha Magic Milk Tea (sometimes the pearls, sometimes mocha, and one time cups!)Now, I am not a sushi fan, so I have never had the sushi, but anyone I go with rants and raves about it. I normally get the spicy edamame which is amazing, and I have tried the regular and garlic and loved them too. I have tried the Cajun Beef, Teriyaki Beef, Spicy Cream Chicken (my favorite), and the Sweet and Sour Chicken and enjoyed them every time. I have also had the General Tso's, which is normally my go to favorite Asian dish, and loved it all but one time where it literally looked like canned dog food so I have not ordered it since. My only other complaint would be about the size of the restaurant. Every time I have been there, they are relatively busy, and the space itself is pretty small even if you include the outside seating."
9/9/2016,3,"Love the food not the service. I have eaten inside and it was good. I have ordered in for 'to go' and its 99 % of times, that they come up with food and ask you if its 'to go' and again go back to pack it. Thats just such a waste of time.Now today, called in thinking the food will be ready when I get there, it sat there until she finished taking everyones orders. She said I had to wait in line!!  Real waste of time when you get your order after 25 mins after ordering on the phone. They were quiet busy but only one register was open and no one else could take orders. Don't undertsand why they do not hire more people to take orders."
11/25/2011,5,"Passing through Orlando I was craving two things: sushi and bubble tea; this place had both. When I arrived, they did honor the Yelp check in offer of one free appetizer with $10 purchase. I chose edamame and wasn't disappointed in the slightest.They have a huge menu of sushi and then also have noodle soups and other things, but I was here for the sushi. They had tons of specially rolls and even a create your own option, but I got the TNT roll and a couple pieces of nigri. The fresh was super fresh and the TNT roll was super spicy. I got an almond bubble tea which was delicious. They have lots of flavors of these and they go great with sushi. I'd come back here for sure."
2/18/2012,3,"The Sand Lake Bento Cafe is part of a 5-restaurant chain based in Gainesville. It's a casual Pan Asian-sushi spot located next to Bar Louie in the Rialto Center on Restaurant Row.One can feel the college-town origins here, as prices are pretty low, rock music rather than Eastern music is played, and the clientele tends to be on the young side.  This location is apparently very popular, if today was any indication.  I don't know if I've ever been to a sushi restaurant that was doing so much Saturday lunch business, both dine-in and takeaway.I guess the draw is the nicely-priced bento boxes.  However, I chose the sushi menu, which features a pretty nice assortment of nigiri, sashimi and specialty rolls.  The nigiri/sashimi offerings eclipsed the rolls, which was okay by me.  I enjoyed a nice grouping of salmon and eel sashimi, and a masago nigiri, along with a Veggie Delight Roll and a Mexican Roll.This isn't the place to go to impress a date, but it sates your sushi cravings at an affordable price."
1/24/2016,5,"Amazing food, seated at our table promptly, service was great, and the food was amazing. Definitely should be in your list for places to go to grab sushi."
10/19/2011,4,"Great sushi place close to Universal Studios. Got a free appetizers with the yelp app on my phone..sweet! I tried the vegetarian roll and the mexican roll, both quite good. My friends were also happy with their selection. Staff was on point. Nice decor. Affordable prices."
11/8/2010,4,"My Ratings: Quantity: 4 - plentyQuality: 4 - yummyPrice: 4 - goodLocation: 4 - Cool place!Parking: 4 - Parking lot Service: 4 - coolSpeed: 3 - GoodOverall: I would come back for their sushi!My Opinion/Story: Got a groupon to try this place while we're in the area.

5/5/2015,4,This restaurant was pretty good. The sushi was decent and I do like the prices. I do enjoy the job idea that they have with the bento box. I went there with my co workers for lunch once a while and the bento box is always what I get for a decent price. They are pretty quick to I usually get my food in and by 15 mins I am usually out the door and headed back to work to eat there. The service there is nice the workers are friendly there are some that are not to customer service friendly but I can deal with it other then that will be still going there once in a while when I am in the mood for sushi.
3/21/2016,5,"One of my favorite places to go for work lunch. Buy one get one boba tea on Tuesdays, amazing curry katsu noodle bowl, and the sushi combo box is great sushi for its price."
1/25/2013,4,"The first time I ever had sushi was at a Bento in Gainesville in 2005-2006.  This has proven to be a reliable chain when it comes to sushi and noodle bowls.  This location has a clean modern looking interior (most of them do) with a tv behind the bar and tvs on the opposite wall in the main dining area.  The fish is generally fresh and they have a great buy 2 get 1 free happy our special on select sushi rolls running throughout the week.  Whether it be sushi rolls, noodle bowls or sashimi Bento has a bit of everything for the beginner to intermediate fan of Japanese food.  For those chickens that are afraid to try sushi because the fish may not be cooked, there are alternative sushi rolls that contain cooked chicken or beef.  Fake it til you make it!"
1/1/2016,4,"Bento Cafe, first time there was in Jacksonville FL and it was packed and the food was excellent. Then we found one in Orlando and it was amazing as well. The food is very good and service is good as well. Highly recommend."
12/12/2010,1,"I'm in the same boat as Mike M. Why on earth do people like this place? I was recommended to go by a friend as a good place for sushi when looking for a good new place to try.  On my first trip, I took my Japanese friend and we both were not really sure where to sit but finally got some direction. Our waiter was a nice girl but a little confused but that could be from my friend's accent I guess. Anyway we didn't end up getting sushi but decided to try a bento box instead. Big mistake. Completely lacking in flavor, my friend's stir fry looked mushy and wasn't very tasty. The little cake that comes with it yeah no thanks. Nobody likes dry weird cake. My second visit came because my boss had one of those restaurant.com coupons and he wanted to take me and my boyfriend out for dinner. I agreed to go so we could try their boba and their sushi and give it a second shot. We should have just eaten at Bar Louie next door.We got appetizers because they had a buy 1 get one free. Spring rolls were mushy on the inside once you bit into them, mushy vegetables are no good. Dumplings tasted funny I didn't even finish a whole one. Whatever weird sauce they slather it in, that would be to hide the taste of awful.So next Is boba, my boyfriend's was lukewarm and mine though cold just wasn't very good. I didn't even get half way through. If you looked at my cup you'd think I hadn't drank any. I'll stick to lollicup and traveling to my favorite cities and hitting up their japan/china towns thanks. I like variety when I order anyway and their selection is very lacking.My boss doesn't approve of any place where all the drinks come in thin plastic cups. I ordered Udon ha, the noodles tasted like the precooked kind from the grocery store and the soup was flavorless as was the chicken. It's strange because I thought I'd ordered spicy udon. For my first udon outside of San Francisco definitely a mistake to get it here. I barely ate it, the waitress asked me if I wanted a to go container and I just laughed. My bf got sushi to which he said you could get better sushi at whole foods. I've never seen this guy not finish sushi EVER. He said it was one step up from being bad sushi and that it wasn't good. Never again, if a group of friends are going here they can count me way out."
5/3/2012,4,"They have a great selection of Japanese beers, I chose the Kirin Light, and in Japanese style they pour it into your glass for you and you still have half a bottle left. For an appetizer I ordered the sushi sampler which come with a tuna role and 5 pieces of sushi (you choose which 5) and for my main course I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken Bento Box"
2/1/2013,3,"This place is okay, but I don't get the concept. Why do I have to order at the counter when the rest of the place is run like a regular table service restaurant? If you want an assortment of sushi, it's awkward to have to decide on everything while in line. Quality of the bento boxes is fine, but I'd rather just go to a sushi bar."
5/12/2018,5,i love thiss soo muchh. best food ever. cane all the way from miami. thwjdjcjxjfjjfd f. f. d dd d e f. g r e r  g rr tf ff f f ffr wew ef. g hh
5/5/2018,4,"The food is great, and there are sufficent options for vegetarian people as well. The only downside is that the boba is mediocre."
8/20/2015,1,"I had my food delivered through doorstep. I paid almost $11 for a spicy seafood udon noodle bowl. It wasn't udon. It was egg noodle. Seafood? Are you joking with me? It was literally 6 pieces of small shrimp, two imitation crab sticks, 4 pea size scallop with bokchoy. I don't know why I expected so much from such a low quality Asian fusion restaurant."
11/17/2011,3,"I've been coming here for quite some time now and I can say with confidence it's not somewhere that always sticks out in my mind, it's always just a plan B. The edamame is always over-cooked, the sushi never tastes fresh, and the stir-fry never seems to have enough flavor for me. The one good thing is they have a great selection of Sake, which I LOVE. Also, their service is always on point which always makes an experience better for me. Other than that, nothing else really comes to mind about Bento for me."
10/18/2015,1,"Service was extremely slow. Our waitress had the worst attitude. The food wasn't special, won't come back."
8/4/2015,4,"Love the assortment in the bento box. I had the sweet & sour chicken, it was good (especially liked the richness of the sauce). My husband had the black bean chicken, and he said it was excellent. We also had the edamame (free with Yelp coupon). We plan on returning to try other items!"
4/13/2018,5,As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is great. Shawn was our server and he is the best. His personality is amazing and he's an excellent people person this place is highly recommended and if you go ask for shawn.
6/28/2011,4,"I LOVE this place! And I definitely miss it ! Used to eat here all the time when I lived in Orlando-- breakfast, lunch, and dinner... okay exaggerating a bit. But I did frequent this place at least a couple times a week. Love the noodle bowls. Great flavor! Lots to choose from. It's Pan Asian, so you'll get Chinese, Thai, Korean, and Japanese. The sushi rolls are really good too and the chef usually have a special roll of the day (his creation). And I've seen by popular demand, some of them ended up on the menu as a permanent item. They have flavored sake which is really cool. (I'm not a sake connoisseur so it is sweet flavored and palatable, its considered good to me!) The y have boba (bubble) tea as well- which I'm not a huge fan of-- I've had better ones.  All in all, great place. Love it. Miss it."
6/3/2013,4,"Really great chicken teriyaki.  Nice, clean, upscale atmosphere at a pretty cheap price.  The Bento Box comes with a bunch of sides for under $10.  Yelp reviewers have put Sushiology above this place... go here instead!  It's just all the International Drive tourists leaving reviews because they don't want to wander a half mile off I Drive."
9/27/2010,3,"Again, a place that I was curious about and finally visited, thanks to an outstanding offer made by Groupon!In contrast to my other super deals (bikram yoga, dandelion) however, I have to say...well, I'll take a quotation from one of my favorite movies, 10 things I hate about you - ""I know you can be overwhelmed or underwhelmed, but could you ever just be whelmed?"" Yes, and Bento cafe is living proof.To be fair, yes, I did enjoy my boba tea and the meal I chose definitely was eaten, but other than that...see, I had checked out Yelp! and was prepared for their slightly confusing ordering system and blasé interior decorating, but was surprised by the ambivalent nature of the servers and noticeable annoyance at the sight of my printed coupon.  We waited for what seemed like hours for the cashier to find our info in a printed stack of what I presumed to be other Groupon purchasers and an eye roll was hardly suppressed at my husband who was so equate befuddled by the menu.Lunch itself proved enjoyable, but neither of us felt compelled to return."
4/3/2018,5,"Their sushi is definitely a hidden gem in Orlando. Great atmosphere, great bowls, great boba tea. Something that really stood out was there service. Someone needs to promote Sean because this guy does everything right. This guy goes above and beyond and this sushi joint is lucky to have someone like him. Definitely will be coming back!"
6/29/2012,4,"OK so, yeah it's counter service, ""sort of"" but really who cares?  My dad doesn't like this place at all because you order at the register like Pei Wei, but I say phooey to him because you can sit at the Sushi bar and get served just like anywhere else.  Not to mention they have a really nice array of sushi and kitchen dishes, so there's something for everyone.  The place is well decorated and always has great tunes playing in the background, and to top it all off, they finally have free wi-fi so I can go here at lunch and eat a nice meal and continue with my workday.  Thanks Bento! So lets talk about the food, I had a Chirashi again... and it was a nice assortment of sashimi on the rice like usual and even had seaweed salad (yum) on the plate to add the nice crunch.  When I checked in on Yelp, they had a great offer for a free appetizer... Yes please, I think I will enjoy the spicy steamed dumplings!!! Thanks again Bento!  My friend met me there and she had a beefy soup noodle bowl.... I don't know what the heck was in it, but it sure was chock full of meat, noodles, broth and all kinds of colorful veggies... I didn't taste it... we're not that close... lol... But if I had been there with the girlfriend, I would have been pushing her a side to get whiff and slurp of the soup....So go check out Bento Cafe and make friends with the sushi chefs, they haven't really changed there in years... always the same guys and they always remember my name and will make you something a little special.  If you are a Seito Sushi or Amuras fan, go there and spend crazy amounts of money and help keep the lines shorter at Bento for me... because this place has good sushi and other fixin's at a great price if you don't mind ordering at a counter.Note, this place gets busy and sometimes the service suffers a little because of that, but remember, you order at the counter, you can get your own drinks etc., so there's really no reason to complain, just get up and get what you need.Arigato!"
9/14/2017,1,"I'm sad to say that I rate this place based on my experience today, I have been a loyal customer since I have moved to Orlando. Where do I start to describe the way Bento Cafe and its management lack experience in problem solving. We waited about 20min to get our drinks after we placed our order. Then when we received our sushi it wasn't made the way we specified with soy paper instead of seaweed. Then after waited another 20min for our food to have seaweed and fish broth in my chicken udon soup. I have gone to several places in the US alone that make several options with the broth: chicken, beef, shrimp/fish. It wasn't specified on the menu that they only offer fish broth. Not only that they brought a plate that we didn't order, instead of the chicken fried rice we did. Still hadn't received my Milk tea, until all the food came. Okay so they fixed it with getting me a bento box pronto status and fixing the chicken fried rice mix up. Thanks. So we finally eat. The chicken is so burnt I can't even eat some of it. The waiter offered to give us a discount $5 off for various things going wrong. We get the check. I get the wrong ticket and change back. I am finally upset with their lack of customer service. I had to remind my waiter how much money I gave him. I had to literally count the money in front of him and tell him how much change to give me back.  What a headache of experience for my family dinner."
6/26/2016,5,"Having only recently started going to Bento Café, I am completely hooked. The Gucci Roll is a must for each visit that I make to Bento. A new favorite of mine is the Mt. Fuji roll. The krab was cooked perfectly and still warm enough after a 15 min drive home. The best part about Bento though, is that they have plenty of locations in the Orlando area so that it's always pretty convenient to visit one. Even if one isn't nearby, I will still go out of my way for a Bento fix."
12/31/2010,2,"Came to Bento's Cafe last year, however I still remember the experience of Bento's quite vividly. The atmosphere of this place is modern and electric. Very lively and I guess what you can say ''Americanized.'' I remember I ordered a Bento Box. When it arrived, I stared blankly at the mushed rice and wilted veggies... my eyes even popped a little at the square chocolate cake in the side slot. Okay, now I knew I was in for a surprise~! The main shrimp was OKAY. You could easily grill shrimp at home with better result and taste. The veggies/salad was SO SALTY. I'm not sure if the sauce was salty or if the chef mistakenly added one too many teaspoons of salt.. but talk about packing on the sodium! The rice..was okay as well. Wasn't fluffy. Bleh. (NON-FLUFFY RICE = big nono ) My friend ordered tempura shrimp which was pretty decent tasting. It wasn't dripping in oil, but there was no wow factor to it. Another companion had an order of sushi, I can't recall what type of roll it was.. but I remember the it being tasteless. No fresh ingredients nor colorful bounce in the mouth. NOW.. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOBA TEA HERE: one word : GROSS! Save your money and go to Lolicup or elsewhere if you're looking for Boba tea! The Boba tea they serve here shouldn't even be consider Boba tea, more like.. .Grainy colored milk. T__T. I can't believe spent so much money here. The honey dew Boba was disgusting. Too overly sweet and the texture WAS NOT pleasant. All in all, the vibe of Bento's Cafe is lovely. The staff is friendly and it has a cool fun feel to it. (Best for LUNCH meet up with friends) Do not go here if you're looking for yummy Asian cuisine, stray far..and go a little further...."
8/7/2015,3,"Good food, good service. Been here many times and the food isn't always consistent. However it's decent enough that if I want a boba and katsu I'll come here. Good sushi selection. But the boba is the main reason I come. Bento box is ok, however I feel like it's better to get a main dish."
2/6/2013,4,"Perfect little hotspot where you can dine quickly or stay and enjoy the atmosphere. I wish they would open these down south, I think they would do really well! Anyways, I've been to the Bentos in Gainesville and Orlando many times. On rate occasions does it ever disappoint. There are SO many different entree options to choose from! Which is a blessing AND a curse, haha. My favorite thing is that you can pretty much choose any entree and then choose to have it as a rice bowl, noodle bowl or as a bento box that comes with your typical bento sides. With a drink here ( of course, get Boba! ) you're looking to spend approx $10 pp. but it's not bad because it's a good amount of food and it'll last you awhile. My favorite are the bulgogi & mongolian rice bowls. I tried the Thai Fried Rice here and it was bland, IMO. But, on the plus, it was spicy! They added a bunch of chili peppers which I'm totally not even used to. Coming from Miami, when you are spicy it's barely a hint. Here, it's added in without a warning and I really enjoyed that. More ""authentic"" and brings the heat -- literally."
12/13/2017,4,"I go here all the time and most of the time the food is very good. The hot dishes come very fresh and quick. The sushi has usually been good quality fish. The only thing that needs work is the staff is very good at avoiding working. They are actually kinda lazy in serving and cleaning! But I still rate the food good, especially since in the area there is not many other sushi places."
10/8/2017,4,I really loved the food and I been here numerous times. The variety is wonderful but make sure you don't go to late like a hour before it closes or else you won't get utensils and will either have to eat with chopsticks or plastic forks/knives. I will go back but NEVER a hour before it closes again.
9/16/2014,4,"After getting back from the theme park and a 10-hour fun-flled day, the stomach began to make some rumblings, and the sweet tooth came out to play, its 11 pm and late night  dine-in food options on the Disney World Property are very very scarce, if not non-existent. So this is where #yelpHelps, simple quick search for Boba Tea/orlando/late nite, and boom Bento Box shows up, remind you main thing we are going now for is Boba Tea, but as we continue to read the reviews, the boba quality seems to not be up too par and quality is rated poor by many, so we continite to search for places open for boba tea past 11pm on a saturday night, after a few more minutes of searching and traveling along the I-4, we realize there are no other options, so its either Bento Box or Nothing, As we enter the plaza, we come across alot of cars, and a lil nite spot, ""Bar Louie"", beside Bento Box. Reading the reviews, we already have suspect expectations of the boba tea, but still want, so we figure to give it a shot. The Waitress comes and we order boba tea first, but  it turns out they have run out of ""pearls"" (boba) for the day, it's 11.40pm so  i guess it was somewhat understandable, but how is it ""boba tea"", with no boba? Disappointed at this point, I chose not to order a boba tea, but the rest of the party does, she orders a Pineapple-Mango,ironicly it turned out to being one of my most flavorful teas she has ever had, now only if it had boba, tisk tisk. Ordered a miso soup, a jb roll, and candy roll. The Candy Roll was very good. The menu may look simple at first, but they have a very wide variety of pan-asian and sushi dishes, I will be sure to re-visit Bento Box on a future trip to Orlando as that Im very curious to try some of the other sushi rolls and dishes that I saw on the menu, and hopefully next time they will have bobas for the tea.Nice simple decor, not over the top, but chic spot, Food is priced well, not overly expensive. A True example of how helpful Yelp is for late-nite out of town sitituations, good thing we followed our instincts and still gave the place a shot, even after reading the negative reviews, we would have never discovered this future spot if we didnt try it out for ourselves. So yea Reviews are good and all, provides a heads-up, but if you have that yearning/instinct that wants to find out  for yourself, always do so!!#yelpHelps"
2/27/2018,3,I went in for lunch and I mentioned to the Spanish guy cashier how the other day I had come in for lunch as well like I usually do. So I told him I had ordered edamame to go on my last visit but that it had been a little burnt and they tasted a little old the garlic didn't look nor tasted fresh it kind of looked like it had been sitting there and they just gave it to me to get rid of it. He kind of cut me off and said I should have called that same day and I could have been compensated or they could have fixed the problem. It wasn't a big deal at the time I was only trying to let him know that I didn't want it that way again but he didn't reassure me or apologize as he saw I was a little disappointed. He ended up giving me the runaround so I ended up taking my lunch and not reordering my edamame. Will I go back? Probably not as that cashier kind of ruined my experience and overall I would give this place only a 3 for customer service apparently the customer is not always right here.
2/7/2012,4,"We had a very enjoyable meal at Bento. The restaurant itself is very clean, and our waiter was very helpful, as this was our first visit. I fully enjoyed the Red Curry Shrimp noodle bowl, just the right amount of heat, the noodles were firm and tasty, the vegetables fresh and crisp, and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My wife had the Thai Coconut Chicken noodle bowl; again, everything cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. We would very definitely return for another meal, especially as it is one of the most reasonably-priced restaurants in the area."
9/3/2014,3,"Bento is a great fast casual restaurant (at lunch) that turns into casual dining for dinner. Not being from Orlando, we've brought a couple groups from out of town here and they are always impressed by the quality of the food (sushi and main menu) as well as the value. Sushi can be (VERY) slow but main menu/hot dishes are pretty quick. Service is the one reason they are a 3 not a 4 star. While servers are nice enough, they aren't invested in the experience. Weekdays you can get 1/2 off sushi and walk away full without a huge hit to the wallet. I'm a sucker for their bento boxes that come with a little bit of everything but particularly like the black bean bowl. The dinner menu is setup like pei wei, you pick the flavor, the protein and the plus is you can either have it delivered bento, rice bowl or noodle bowl style. Happy Eating!"
1/1/2015,1,"Everyone told me to try this restuarant. So I did, I ordered udon noodle bowl with chicken. The bowl was very watery and had no flavor. When I told the server I didn't like it she didn't know what to do. She got her manager and the manager said I would have to pay for half of my meal that I didn't like and the full price for a new meal. I only had two bites from the noodle bowl. This was the worst guest service I have ever experienced. And the food was tasteless"
11/8/2015,5,"OMG! After a while day we of shopping we were craving noodles and sushi. We came across Bento Cafe. Wanda our server was super friendly and so helpful when we were ordering. The sake, sushi, boba and especially Bento box was super delicious and exactly what we needed. We our fans! :-)"
11/27/2016,1,"I eat sushi often and this is the first Resteraunt I've been to that no one in the Resteraunt could answer my question regarding one of the cuts for my sashimi platter. They had no idea what or where it came from.  The server kept telling me it's a fish.  Sorry, many Restaurants serve garbage  fish like Escobar ( they call it white tuna).  I decided to leave at this point."
3/27/2016,2,"I love the food, but that is all I like about Bento. The service is horrible. I feel like they don't know what they are doing, they always mess my order up, like I said before I really enjoy the food, but they really need to learn great customer service."
10/19/2015,5,"I've been to a Bento Café in Jacksonville, and I love it. This location is just as good. Amazing sushi, and delicious milk teas. I really enjoyed the miso soup, too! I can't wait to go back!"
5/16/2015,5,"My friends and I come here on a regular and it has not disappointed yet! It's great for lunch, you can even get free appetizer when you check in with yelp. The sushi is made fresh, boba tea is yummy! So many great things to mention but I'll just have to let y'all try it for yourselves"
12/27/2017,2,"Don't waste your time. Waited in line for 15 minutes to get an overpriced 11.00 ""signature"" roll that was SUCH SMALL pieces and served on a white appetizer plate. Oh and, my boyfriend had to pay $9.00 for a TWO ingredient sushi roll because of allergies. Salmon and cream cheese. Total ripoff. Go to a real sushi restaurant where you will get your money's worth."
7/26/2015,5,"We are from Miami and every time we drive up to Orlando, we have to eat at Bento Cafe. The food is good and the prices are good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
8/16/2010,4,I like to order the teriyaki beef bento box.  The crunch roll is really good and I normally get that with the house salad which is fresh or the seaweed salad. This place is good and inexpensive.  Try the bubble tea and smoothie with the bubbles.  This is a nice chill place where my friends and I catch up.
2/20/2014,3,"We've ordered from here a few times and the experience has always been mixed. The good: prices are low, and some of the items can be quite tastyThe Bad: Can get very crowded, definitely better to order in and the quality of food is inconsistentOverall, I'd say this is a decent place to try out some well-priced sushi, especially if you're close by"
1/8/2013,3,"I've been going to the Bento's in Gainesville occassionaly for the past 8 years or so? And I've been to this Bento (and the one in downtown Orlando) a few times, and didn't have a complaint until now. My family was with 2 other families, and we totaled 20 people. Large group, hard to miss, obviously need to be seated. However, I think we were standing there for several minutes before anyone paid us any attention. One of our girls had to stop someone and ask for tables to be setup for us. I can't complain about the rest of our service, though. Handling 20 people is quite a struggle, I'm sure, so I try to be as patient and understanding as possible.The thing I like about Bento is their big menu of boba flavors. What I don't like about that menu is that they have names like Lover's or something or other that give no clue what flavors actually comprise the drink. But all the servers do know their stuff and can explain it to you. Sadly, the boba milk tea I ordered came out room temperature. They didn't put ice in it. Or if they did, it was so little that it melted already but didn't keep my drink cold. Yuck.I usually order off the sushi menu, but I was feeling a little different that day and ordered curry. Lesson learned. I will stick to the sushi. It's not that the curry was terrible. It just wasn't good enough for me to finish it. They definitely do sushi better."
9/11/2010,3,"Bento Cafe for dinner. Yummy! I'm usually not one for fusion cuisine, however I like this unfussy casual restaurant. Weeknights and all day on weekends it's table service. Not what I was expecting, but appreciated as it can be hard to deal with a tray with a small one in tow... For an appetizer we ordered the fried pork dumplings, 5 per order. The pork filling was flavorful, but I'm not a huge fan of the fried part. The dipping sauce was a delicious blend of soy sauce and chili sauce. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll. The fish was fresh and the spicy sauce was spicy, but the roll was slightly warm and the rice slightly too sweet. I would skip the sushi on a next visit. I ordered the Korean Spicy with chicken over noodles; slices of white chicken with onion and scallion in a mild Korean pepper paste. I didn't quite read the ""mild"" part, so was disappointed in the heat index. However, it was flavorful and not greasy/oily and the mini udon noodles were cooked just right. Husband ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Rice bowl. Tasted like... Teriyaki Chicken over rice. Also came with a side of stir fried green beans. Green beans were good, but a little greasy. Small one ordered the Chicken Fried Rice with no veggies. (I finally figured out that it's easier to order without, than to try and pick them all out!) Order initially came out with veggies, but they quickly made a replacement. Tasteless, but I can't fault the kitchen for that! Ordering can be overwhelming as you have a choice between a bento box, rice bowl or noodle bowl, then the entree ""topping"". Plus, there are several choices of protein for each entree. There is a PDF menu available on-line at the website, so if you have difficulty making snap decisions when it comes to food, you might want to take a look prior to heading out for your meal. Note: the kids menu is not available on-line, but they had a nice variety for the kids. Overall I enjoyed our experience and we'll be back in the future!"
4/16/2015,5,Keep coming back for the sushi! It's a go to for my friends and I on a day off or after work looking for good food. My buddy gets the bowls everytime and loves them. Miso soup is nice to start with. Don't miss out on that Dragon roll.
3/8/2011,4,Let me preface this with the following:  I love all different kinds of sushi and sashimi.  I can appreciate beautifully prepared cuts and mucked up Americanized disasters.I have had a great time every time I have visited this place.It's funky.  The booth has pillows and a funky lounge feel.I love that they have a dozen spicy rolls and many come with roe... nom nom!  I have not had any issues with chewy nori nor overly fishiness.The service is friendly; I have only had positive experiences!
3/20/2012,4,"I really like the food here but to be honest - I only go for the teas really. :) They are just too good (and too cute). We don't go here often because it's completely out of the way for us, but I like this location more than the one downtown. Wish they would open one in the Altamonte Springs area! I am sure it would do really well. Then I could get my teas more often. :("
8/11/2014,5,"Bento is awesome. They are nicely located,  their menu offers a great variety of Asian dishes and the price is just right. The staff is very friendly, but the restaurant is somewhat small... So reservation is recommended since they are usually busy."
5/9/2017,3,"Mediocre at best, too may other choices on Sand Lake Rd . Waited a long time for a very disorganized hostess to seat us. Ordered the box with beef, was ok. Others in party ordered sushi and other dishes. All, just Ok, but it is a inexpensive meal and that was what we received.  Waiter was good and made up for some of hostesses shortcomings."
5/3/2015,4,"The food is good not spectacular,  the service is good too, just get in mind you get what you pay, but for the price is worth the visit"
2/8/2015,4,"They have a great selection of Asian foods from Sushi to Chinese to noodle and rice bowls. Clean, contemporary decor and so far I've loved everything I've tried here. Lychee green tea is a must!"
1/22/2012,5,"Excellent Sushi!  We always sit at the Sushi bar and the chefs take care of us right away.  They will make speciality rolls if we request and service is always quick.  Food is priced reasonable and its a cool, laid back atmosphere.  Highly recommended.  Amura used to be my favorite but its just to stuff and overpriced, Bento Cafe's Sushi is as good if not better."
9/5/2017,4,"Great place to go have a nice dinner at, the food is pretty good and the service is great. Our server Manny was very well-mannered and took care of us very well. Will be coming back soon!"
11/30/2014,1,I've been to multiple bento locations all over Florida but the customer service at this one is definitely the worst. I called an order in for pick-up and upon arrival the girl at the register just ignored me as she closed other checks. I then said something to get her attention and said she would be right with me as she still continued to close out checks and wouldn't call anyone else to help me in picking up my order. They also gave me white rice instead of brown rice(but charged me the extra $1.50) and when I got home and opened my food I saw that they hadn't included the sauce that comes with the dish. Worst bento experience.
8/8/2017,5,ITS AMAZING! The katsu chicken noodle bowl is so good and great for people who don't know what to order. So grateful my friend introduced me to this place!
5/6/2015,5,"Fast, delicious and affordable food!  Great service and always nice atmosphere- conveniently located :)"
4/26/2017,1,Who charges for an extra side of Siracha? This is a chain... Not even mom and pop restaurants do that
4/18/2017,2,"Their boba teas lately have been TERRIBLE. I don't know who is making them now but they're trying to rip us off by using way smaller cups, half the time they're ""ran out"" of tea??? And when they do make it it's horrible flavor. Wtf?"
5/2/2011,3,"I want to give 3 and 1/2 stars.As the other reviewers commented, Bento Cafe has a nice modern atmosphere. The waiters and waitresses I encountered were all nice and helpful. I ordered rolls (spider and eel) while the rest of my family ordered bento boxes. Everyone enjoyed their bento boxes, but I've had much better rolls elsewhere. The rolls were very small. Particularly the spider roll; I had to use a magnifying glass to find the crabmeat in those rolls -- lol."
3/29/2015,5,Fantastic Sushi!! Can't believe this place isn't higher rated!! Tons of options!! Very fresh and tasty!! Would come back in a heartbeat! Prices are great!!
6/18/2017,1,Terrible service! I called my order in 15 minutes before I picked it up and came in and paid. I then waited another 15 minutes before realizing people who walked in and ordered after me we already eating. I asked how much longer and they said they didn't know because they were behind and there excuse was they were behind because it was Father's Day. But hello people who came in after me were eating so that didn't add up.  I think they forgot to put my order in when I called and instead of telling me that just made me wait 45 minutes for fast food sushi.
6/8/2017,1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. My favorite dish has been ruined. Bento please bring back the old baby udon noodles. These new ones are horrible
10/4/2016,5,"i love this place! service is always always great, seriously now that i think about it, the amount of times we've been here and the amount of trips in which we experienced bad service totals to 0 which is pretty much statistically impossible.  that being said, go! my favorites are the pad thai noodle bowl, or the red curry chicken katsu bento box. Remember to order yourself a boba tea on your way out!"
4/30/2014,3,So we stop and had lunch here. I have to nothing special about this restaurant. The service was ok and nothing we order stood  out. We all agreed that kyotos is much better.
9/11/2014,4,"My wife gets a hanker for sushi monthly and we have tried multiple locations around town, most have limited non sushi menu's until Bento Box.  I would pass most times due to the fact I am not a big fan of sushi but I am a fan of Bento. Good stuff."
11/11/2014,4,"I love their Mochi dessert especially the red bean and mango flavors.  I have tried the veggie roll, the veggie delite roll and the cucumber avocado roll and I love them all. They are put together very well and are tasty. You can also get plain edamame, garlic or spicy. All 3 are yummy but my favorite is the garlic. It's usually busy when I go there but the service is always friendly and timely.  I love that it is a casual place and the prices are great too!"
2/20/2014,1,This place sucks. Sushi is average. Waiter wouldn't let me take my sushi roll leftovers because it was happy hour. Ridiculous. Never coming again.
8/1/2014,4,Really enjoyed the sushi and the shu mai appetizer is very good. My favorite sushi is the Gucci roll its texture of crunchy and hot is what makes is awesome. Only thing I found odd is they charge extra for sauces
7/26/2014,4,"Surprisingly good. I have high standards when it comes to sushi, but this place was a nice surprise. I was craving a sashimi bowl. It hit the spot and will have me coming back for seconds!"
7/22/2016,2,"The food was amazing, but the only two things that ruined it was the service and the boba. The boba was terrible. I ordered a taro and taro is suppose to have a purple color, but I got it and it was brown. It was putrid. The server, I have no idea where to start. She looked like she hated her job. I understand if you probably judged us before you got to the table, like oh look I got young adults and I'm not going to receive tip. I work in a restaurant and I give 100% service, despite skin color or attitude, because it's my money and I need to earn it. It was so frustrating to have that server, I'm assuming her name was Shannon or dean one of those. Yes, my service was that bad that she didn't introduced herself or she made it not recognizable. I can recognize her face if I saw her, but I do not ever want to receive her service again. I've had several services like that at bento and I feel like they need to retrain most of the staff."
7/19/2014,5,Love Bento! I come here all the time for lunch. Every sushi roll I've ordered is delicious. My favorite items on the menu are the Special Mexican Roll and Spicy Tuna Don.
5/16/2014,4,"We ordered two rolls made with brown rice. The seafood was fresh, the food tasted great but the rolls would fall apart before I could get them off the plate. The service was nice but we did wait 20-30mins just for our two rolls. Then when we ordered the green tea ice cream dessert, that took 15mins. It's a nice place and the fact you order your food up at the register & then sit makes you feel like it's a ""fast"" sushi place. It wasn't fast at all but the food was great."
12/11/2013,5,"LOVE this place!!! When  a friend brought me in the first time, the service was great,  but the Spicy Seafood soup bowl was soo authentic & awesome, I decided to come back again!!Now I can honestly say I eat here at least once a week for dinner, if not more!!The staff is friendly and accommodating & is always happy to alter dishes & sauces to my requests. THERE IS NOT A BAD DISH ON THE MENU that I have eaten- and since I eat there so often, It's fair to say I've tried a LOT of dishes-my favorites- BULGOGIBASIL SOY CHILIand for you seafood lovers -SEAFOOD with a medley of shrimp, scallop and squid in a light ginger soy over Chinese bok chop-so Yummy!!Also don't forget the delicious spicy Udon seafood  noodle soup - entire meal in itself!Most importantly, if you ever have an issue, or  need a dish to be modified, don't hesitate to ask for the 2 efficient ( & cutest ) Managers - Luis and Frankie - these guys will do everything in their power to get your meal just perfect!! All round, the best dining experience for your taste - buds and pocket-You will definitely recommend it to others & come back for more!!!"
3/20/2014,5,"I think by now I could be called a sushi expert and this place is top notch for my foodie flavors.  The Una don bowl is fantastic at 9.95 and comes with  eel, rice and seaweed salad.  Plenty to fill me up.  And the best part is they are open until 11:30 on Friday and Saturday nights.  Service has always been top notch.  Just wish it were closer to home. Oh well, Cant have everything."
3/15/2015,3,"I've been coming to bento for a while now and they've recently changed the way they do things. It took forever to get our food, much longer than I've ever had to wait before. The service was poor, but luckily the food is still good."
10/1/2016,1,"After years of eating here I am done! The service in this place is appalling. The host that sat us literally started arguing with us over our table preference. Long story short, out of the 20 tables open the only one we were allowed to have was next to the bathroom. When I finally asked to talk to a manager out of embarrassment by the manner in which she was acting, turns out she is the manager. We left and went next door for sandwiches. Much better."
11/4/2010,5,"I love it! I was a little worried that it'd be like every other Asian restaurant. The staff is soo helpful and they make my order in a quick,timely manner.  The atmosphere is soo comfortable and it's a really clean place."
1/31/2014,3,"This place is alright.  Their entrée dishes are actually pretty good, but I've had better sushi at other local spots.  Warning, they get really busy during lunch so if you're looking for something quick try Jimmy Johns next door!"
11/10/2014,5,"Quick, pretty inexpensive and so filling!  One of my go-tos for a casual get-together."
6/11/2014,5,"Bento is awesome! I love their hot and sour soup, spicy cream chicken, and shrimp tempura! The atmosphere is great, the service is great, the food is amazing (as long as you eat in the restaurant)! I'll keep coming to this place for a long time!"
7/29/2014,5,"I absolutely love Bento Cafe!  They offer cuisine in every dish served.  Not only that, but they have an array of flavors for Boba Tea :)  It's pretty hard to narrow down my favorites,  but I have at least 5."
2/1/2014,5,I just moved to Orlando from Los Angeles and I love Bento. Best sushi ever!! I really love the happy hour pricing. I totally recommend you check it out!!
5/12/2016,5,Been coming to the sand lake location for years. Pretty sure I've tried everything on the menu and it all tastes amazing. The free appetizer from Yelp is always a plus! Love everything on the menu and the green tea boba smoothie is pretty amazing.
10/1/2018,4,i love bento its great i always come with my sister whenever we crave sushi and boba ive experienced with other items on the menu and so far not disappointed the bulgogi is so far my favorite cant wait to try other dishes i am sad that some signature sushi was taken off the menu such as gucci roll or the crab roll but nonetheless i personally love bento cafe i say give it a try
5/4/2014,5,"Great prices for quality sushi! what more can you ask for? How about some warm or cold saki, or some boba tea? love this place..... Definitely my favorite sushi joint!"
6/27/2016,2,All my favorite workers left so now all the workers there are new and don't know what to do or how to serve properly. The food is average. Wouldn't recommend.
11/7/2013,3,"I used to love this place. I would get the spicy tuna salad and the envy roll, the thing is, the fish isn't that fresh. Sometimes it's chewy or colored weird. Because of that I don't go here anymore, and I wouldn't suggest having raw fish at a place like this. The bento boxes are fine, and they have good boba teas. All in all, if you're not getting raw fish, it's a good quick lunch place."
11/24/2014,5,"AWESOME FOOD AND SERVICE! It was my first time and I will definitely go back. Entrance, lobby dining room, and bathrooms where very clean. My servers name was Kenny and he was super friendly and attentive. I had Spicy Cream Chicken on Fried Rice and it was great. The food was very fresh as well as the crab ragu made in house same day. I will say was the best I have ever had. Definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. If you are not in to sea food or sushi they have a variety of different food that is great for everyone!"
9/11/2014,3,"Coming from Hawaii, Ahi Poke is definitely one of the local dishes I miss. Bento's Ahi Kobachi (Tuna Kobachi) is hands down comparable to the Hawaiian Ahi Poke."
6/14/2014,2,Too expensive and they need a pest control company. Not clean
1/8/2016,4,love the sushi and the yelp deal.. just wish their wifi was better!
11/1/2013,1,"Inexcusable service.  Having dined at Bentos dozens of times in dozens of locations this is the first time that I have experienced a truly unacceptable level of service.  With over 15 people in line to order lunch both cashiers were taking long complicated phone orders, and ignoring the growing line of customers in front of them.  Instead of one cashier working the phone and the other working trough the line, they both were busy ignoring the in store guests.  With tables full and the AC not working at a comfortable level the restaurant was unbearable and had we not made plans for a business meeting to be held here we would have walked out.  Sadly this will be the last time we will use this location for a meeting."
7/25/2012,4,"Great suishi for being downtown.... I liked the lemon crab sushi best, my friends always get their bento boxes and they have an all you can eat sushi day, think either tuesday or thursday.... although you can't share and you have to eat the roles one at at ime and eat them all or you end up paying for what you didnt eat extra.... Fun place to go if your already down town but not my favorite sushi place of choice...."
3/27/2012,4,"Love Bento's!Sandlake's Bento Café at Restaurant Row is part of a chain that is based at Gainesville. Since it opened is packed with locals.

Certainly worth a visit!"
8/3/2014,3,"I ordered the sushi combo box and steamed dumplings. Overall, the rolls were just a little too bland for me. The rice did not taste like sushi rice and the quality of fish was lacking. I have had better experiences at the Bento Cafe locations in Gainesville."
5/6/2014,5,"Very friendly staff and great selection of bento boxes, rice bowls, and sushi. I also like how it's quick service when I come for lunch and then full service during dinner. Great concept. Don't forget to check in on Yelp and get your free appetizer."
9/19/2013,3,"The service here is always a little iffy, but the menu is large and has a wide variety of options.  The sushi here is good, but a little bit on the pricey side; whereas the bento boxes are filling and an awesome value (noodles, salad, rice, a small dessert, plus an entree for $6-$7).  My favorite thing about Bento Cafe?  The boba tea.  Thus far I've tried the almond and the coconut, and both were refreshing, delightful, and overall delicious."
7/22/2016,2,"The food is great don't get me wrong, but the service is horrible. Every time I go they always mess my order up, and my order is not difficult at all( Teriyaki Chicken with plain noddle's) I only come back for the food but I hate the service."
2/13/2012,1,Bad food its like chinese take out very oily sushi tastes like cardboard i've been here couple times trying to give it chances but i always turn up disappointed with the highschool like employees that don't know anything about boba tea i was told that all of the boba teas including mango contained milk??? Idk anywho i stayed away from this place for 7months went back just bc i wanted boba tea and they were out of stock on the little tapioca bubble in the boba so i was mad then the waitress moves so slow. Then i got dizzy and sick after eating bc the food was very oily and greasssy like panda express drive thru food. If u want chinese greasy like takeout that claims its japanese go right ahead.
4/26/2013,4,Bentos is a perfect spot if you are looking for good affordable sushi. The price indicates quality not the best sushi in town but a top competitor in its price range. They have a great variety of rolls tackling every flavor you are looking for. You can even create your own. They have amazing TUNA Nachos. SO GOOD. Must get it. The service is hit or miss but the Sushi is worth it!
6/1/2015,1,"I don't even know what their food tastes like. All I know is, I ordered delivery 2 hours ago, and it's still not here."
1/17/2014,5,"This is one of my regulars!  I would probably eat here every day if I could.  The prices are super cheap!  And yet the food is so good.  My favorites are the noodle soup bowls, the Chirashi bowl (sashimi over rice), and of course...bubble tea!!  Today I had the sashimi and realized that the quality was as good when I was in Tokyo!  Very fresh.  Oh and the service is always super friendly.  Enjoy!"
2/22/2016,1,"They have a terrible service for such good food, it doesn't make any sense to have such good food for this horrible service. I went an hour to pick up my daughter's order considering she's been sick for three days and only wanted bentos since she is in love with the place and goes at least 2 times a week almost and hadn't gone in a while. When I get beck home after an hour, they missed the rice she order and turns out they didn't hand it to us. I call them and ask them how it is that they're so careful to be sure they bill me for everything but are not careful to make sure they hand the customer everything they payed for, most of all after driving for an hour just to get the food. The manager Carie told me they were sorry and that I could pay for a taxi and an extra order to get my rice and i find it truly unbelievable since the mistake was theirs. They ended up just telling me they'd make a credit for the rice for next time I went in."
2/19/2014,4,Over all a good experience. Yummy Flying Dragon Roll (minus the crab) and garlic edamame's. It's a very nice place for a late afternoon lunch. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. I'd just prefer if they came and took my order as opposed to ordering at the counter.
1/30/2010,4,"This was my first experience with sushi at their downtown Orlando location and fell in love!  Their location on Sand Lake has been a little slower to take off, but the food is phenomenal at a really great price.  My only complaint is that the last few times I've been in, the service has been extremely slow - but the food is worth the wait :)"
11/26/2012,2,My second time to go. The food was incredible!!! The service not so much. The wait staff acted as if they just couldn't be bothered. Plus we waited about 35 minutes for food.
4/23/2012,4,"We got lucky and found this on Yelp right after a long day at Universal . It was the best food we've had since we got here ! Great prices , food selection and service! And the free appetizer was nice on the check- in!"
10/23/2012,2,"For my first time eating here I decided to have a take-out which wasn't quite what I expected. Food had pro's and con's. Our food must have been sitting around for a while because when I got home and tried my curry on rice it was so dry. The rice had soaked up all the curry sauce and it became all stuck together. I definitely reccomend more sauce or even the sauce on the side would be even better. It did taste good but had no sauce.The sweet and sour chicken was yummy but again had NO sauce. I definitely will need to ask for extra next time because the rice was pretty bare.Next, the mongolion beef was good but VERY dry and hardly any sauce. Like I said, next time maybe going in there would be a lot better but the take-out food shouldn't be how I received."
4/5/2016,5,"We were staying at a local hotel and wanted an Asian restaurant with later hours and this came up as a good choice and we were very happy we tried it. Great menu with lots of different choices including bento boxes, rice bowls, sushi and very flexible ways to combine them. Prices were great and restaurant has a good vibe and later than avg hours. We liked it so much we came back the 3 other nights we were there! Also, Yelp had a free appetizer coupon which we made use of."
6/14/2018,2,"the service on Take-Out orders is awful. we order for our office almost every week, and they've YET to get it right. there is always something missing: an entrée, the sauce, condiments, a component of the meal - that is REALLY important. I'm done"
7/22/2013,3,Sushi ok...nothing to write home about. Noodle soup bowls are excellent. Very affordable.
8/23/2012,4,"Great place for Sushi. Try the box sushi lunch to try a few different rolls. Order and pay at the counter first, take a number and your sushi is brought to you in a timely manner. Perfect for a quick lunch!"
3/17/2018,1,"I am extremely disappointed in Bento. I have been coming to this location since the first year that they opened. I am a frequent loyal customer until now. I walked in and asked for a couple of changes to the items I wanted to order because of allergies and preferences and the manager (Deana) who was extremely nice but still could not help me! How is it possible to have a manager that looked like she did not know how to help me! Disregarding all of that, my wife who was starving had to run to Zoe's kitchen to eat because Bento could not make pork fried rice. She left to Zoe's, ordered food, ate her food, and came back 40 minutes later and we still haven't even received our food! On top of that several of customers that ordered after we had, got all their food before us. Keep in mind, we only ordered two things. The staff looked flustered and it wasn't even rush hour or busy. My wife, son and I tried to come in early before they were busy in order to avoid the rush. Which we did, so we were very disappointed to receive our food an hour later. As I said before the staff seemed very frustrated and clustered. There was staff yelling at each other and arguing. This was by far the worst experience I had at Bento. I was just happy that the manager Jade was not there because Deana was much nicer. I just felt confused as to why she wasn't able to help me. She gave me a discount for waiting that long but that's not what I wanted, I don't want anything for free I just wanted my food on time and a good experience as I always used to have when the manager Mica was there. Ever since she left the place has gone downfall."
3/11/2016,4,"I ordered a specialty roll and a spicy tuna roll. Both were delicious. I did not care for the fried gyoza, as they were a bit over fried. My server was decent; nothing special but nice and attentive."
8/14/2013,4,Great portion size. Hit the spot with just the right amount of spice.
1/26/2013,2,"Ok food. Nice concept. Not too bright server (when asked if they have Coke Zero i was told, no, they only sell Coke products)"
9/24/2012,4,"I have to say that I absolutely love this place.  I always get the bento and am never disappointed.  Their Bulgogi is so tasty and tender.  Their staff is always friendly and attentive.  Great place, amazing food, and awesome Customer Service.  Keep up the great job Bento."
8/13/2012,2,"Nice location near I-Drive in the Rialto plaza. I came here after reading the reviews and my wife saw that they have vegetarian sushi rolls that seemed interesting to her.  We walked in and were kind of confused as it said please wait to be seated, but there wasn't a host or hostess, and it looked nicer than a diner that usually has those ""wait to be seated signs"". It wasn't a long wait until someone came and sat us in the back corner of the restaurant. I understand that as a couple you want privacy, but I really dislike being sat in the middle of a low traffic area because I find that usually we are forgotten.  Waiter came promptly and asked us what we'd like to drink, we had the unsweetened black tea that came out of the soda machine directly behind my wife. They were served in plastic cups which I found a little off putting since some of the rolls on the menu were as expensive as say a swanky joint like Seito down the road. I expect plastic cups at fast food places, not a place where I'm shelling out $50+ for a meal.  Our waiter disappeared and we literally had to flag down a waitress passing by to order our food.  We had a free appetizer for Yelp check in (Thanks Yelp!) and got the spicy edamame. It tasted almost as good as Roy's edamame which is super delicious. Food came out at odd times, her salad came out almost immediately, and my hot and sour soup came out maybe 5-10 min later. I found this also off putting since my wife waited patiently til I got my soup to eat her salad. Nothing special about the soup or the salad. The waitress that served my soup however was just shy of rude, I don't think she meant to, but she was a little rough with handling the soup and kind of threw napkins on our table and said ""here ya go"" . Our sushi came out next and my wife had ordered both of the vegetarian ones on the menu and loved both of them. Which is a shame, since she rarely finds places that cater to her with veggie sushi that is creative and I am not particularly impressed with Bento so the chances of her getting that sushi again are slim. I had the TNT which for a $10 roll was an afterthought. I actually wouldn't recommend it, it was kind of tasteless and it certainly wasn't spicy as advertised.  I also got the chirashi which I thought was an excellent value. the fish was good and pieces were large but the rice was kind of gross as others have mentioned. The biggest reason for my 2 star review is that I asked what came in the Chirashi and everything was fine except mackerel. I am not a fan of mackerel so I asked to substitute the mackerel for a piece of tuna, not thinking it would be a big deal.  When I received my bill I saw a .75 extra  tuna charge and a 1.50 substitution charge. All to switch out one piece of fish it cost me 2.25, which the waitress did not tell me when I asked for it.  I didn't see anything on the menu stating there would be a charge for substitution and I definitely didn't think I would be charged for an extra piece of fish when it was a substitution. There are much better places for sushi that offer higher quality ingredients and service. For as much as I spent there I could have gone to Seito or Mikado which are much better options. It's too bad my experience wasn't very good since my wife loved her rolls.  I would say go to Bento if you are getting their Bento lunch special or something cheap, but don't buy the ""executive rolls"" and definitely go with lowered expectations."
7/26/2012,2,"I love Bento Cafe in Gainesville.  I walked into this Bento Cafe and I was shocked to find a ""Wait to be Seated"" sign.  What?!?  The point of this place is its counter service.  Being forced to have a waitperson kind of defeats the schtick of this place.  I wonder why it changed?"
1/22/2014,5,Awesome service and reasonable prices! Huge fan of chicken noodle veggie soup! Bento boxes are great options too.
1/26/2012,5,"Gotta love Bento! Atmosphere, food and price is all great. I prefer their Bento box over their sushi rolls. My personal favorite is the Spicy Cream Chicken box.  Actually one night it was six of us and 4 of 6 ordered the Spicy Cream Chicken box - it's delicious! I think the portion size of chicken is a little more generous at the downtown location but I still come here all the time since it's so close to where I live.  I highly recommend, you will definitely find something on the menu that you will like."
11/14/2012,3,Not bad Bubble Tea has been difficult to find in Central Florida.  This is just one of the few that have them.  Food is good buta bit pricy for the portion size.
9/2/2010,4,"this place is crazyyy. It's very moderately priced food, good portions, and large selectios! You get everything from thai, japanese, chinese, and korean! all dishes are around 7 - 9 dollars and you can either choose from the bento box, udon, or rice bowl. They also got boba tea! nice friendly waitresses and hostesses! Came here for the tonkatsu and it was one of the best i've had. the lo mein was pretty non edible.. sushi rice is really good and so was the unagi."
5/6/2013,1,Tried Bento last night and came away with food poisoning. I will never eat here again.
7/15/2013,3,"The sushi was terrific; however, my miso soup was served cold and I waited about 30 minutes for my meal to arrive. I will go back for another try because I enjoyed my dinner and again the sushi was very good."
2/8/2013,3,"First visit at one of these style cafes, since I stopped during the week it was fairly empty and the service was quick. As far as the food I expected more flavor, I got the chicken basil bento it comes with noodles, rice, salad and a small pound cake type dessert. They also have an extensive sushi menu. I would probably go for that next time. Lunch prices are very reasonable."
8/31/2014,2,"Food is great, very fresh but the service is very BAD! The staff is not nice at all, they all saw we walked in and no one came to greet us.. Only after 5 mins. Same with table service, took forever to be greeted. We told the waiter our order and it took him about 10-15 mins to put it in because he was too busy talking to co-workers. One other waiter was making fun of another table."
12/9/2011,4,"Bento is my favorite sushi spot. I love the ambiance of this place. They have an appetizer offer when you check in which made it even better. I try to go earlier in the day, because on the weekends and evenings they tend to get busy and the service isn't that great. I love the special mexican and gyoza!"
7/27/2013,4,Reasonably priced. Friendly staff. Yummy and fresh food. Clean restaurant. Best boba tea in town. My family now frequent this restaurant about once a week.
8/31/2010,2,Gone ar the 2 for 1 sake Saturdays. :-( with the food being bland I can't recommend this place other than being more quiet than Bar Louie.
1/3/2011,3,"Nothing spectacular.  Just good, consistent food.  Sushi, salads, noodles, rice or bento boxes.  It's all pretty good stuff."
1/12/2012,5,I had not tried sushi before eating here and my wife convinced me to have some. It was amazing. The sweet and sour chicken is some of the best I've had as well. Visited here with two Google Offers that they took for a single table and all four in our party agreed...this is a five star restaurant in our books.
6/19/2012,4,"I've been to this place twice now, so that says a little something about the food.  The first time I went, I went with a group of friends who recommended the place.  I ordered their chirashi, salmon skin roll, and two others I don't remember.  My bf ordered the una don because he loves eel.  We each ordered some tea, I ordered the taro milk tea.  The drinks came out fast, the milk tea with the pearls were very good.  A lot of places I've been to in FL, the pearls come out very hard, but theirs was perfect.  The rolls were all very amazing and I am a big fan of their chirashi.  I've gone back to order the boba and try their pho because I had a hankering for them and didn't want to drive down to downtown Orlando.  Definitely NOT a fan of pho.  If you know pho, and been to many pho places, they always give you options of meat, serve you a separate bowl with bean sprouts, basil, and lime (sometimes mint depending on the place).  Everything was just plopped on there, the sprouts were semi-cooked, and there was no lime.  The soup was very good but the overall pho experience, (the whole assembling, fresh veggies, etc) was not there at all.  If you want pho, go downtown.  Their tune salmon nacho however, was AMAZING.  The nachos are made with wonton chips and they put raw tune and salmon on top, with some diced tomato and some spicy sauces.  I do highly recommend it.Overall I think the place is excellent for tea and for any sushi-based dishes.  They've got a huge sushi bar and I think that's what their main focus is about.  The prices for the sushi is decent, like any other sushi places, so I highly recommend this place for sushi, just definitely not pho.Service-wise, when I went during dinner time, we had to wait FOREVER for service and for food, but it is a very busy and happening place at night.  During lunch hours, you order the food, they give you a number, and you sit down wherever, and they bring you your food."
6/26/2011,3,Place is nice.  The bento options are good.  Sushi was OK.  We ordered the TNT expecting it to be hot but it wasn't.  Had to add alot of wasabi to get it hot.  But I would go back for the bentos.
9/20/2011,4,"When you first walk into Bento Cafe it seems like a hip place try. Its located on a nice section of ""Restaurant Row"" near Menchies and Bar Louie. There seems to be a good mixed crowd. A normal meal would range between $10-20. This is one of the few places I've found around here where I can get some Bubble Tea. The Bento Boxes are a great way to get an inexpensive meal. The only complaint I would have is that on some evenings, not even a weekend day, the service can be kind of slow. Overall Im happy with all of my experiences here."
2/26/2015,5,"Everytime I come here,I am always impressed with the food. Whenever family is in town I bring them here as well :-). Awesome good and atmosphere.  There spicy cream chicken is my favorite#"
4/11/2011,3,"It seems like either Bento's is going downhill in quality or there is no standardization of quality amongst all of the different Bento's. I've been a long-standing customer and uber-fan of Bento's in Gainesville since my college years at UF. However, ever since I moved away after graduation, the closest Bento's I've been to is this one in Orlando (whenever I'm in town). Two years ago, I went to this particular Bento's and had a bento box of mongolian beef which was amazingly good, but the presentation didn't look like the usual Bento box I was used to in G-ville. It was still good food though.Fast forward to last week, when I decided to return again and things have really changed. Some people walked up to the register and ordered, per usual Bento style, but others, including my group, were escorted by a waiter. Waiters are a change of pace to Bento's, and I thought it was weird but I enjoyed the change. There has been a sporadic boom of tables and chairs since I last went there, so it seems kind of difficult to get to your table once you get there. Luckily, I was seated at a table near the entrance. Otherwise, I would've bumped into everyone in the place. Change of service and scenery aside, my only real disappointment was in the quality of the food. The sushi my boyfriend had was OK, but the flavor and texture was slightly off. It doesn't compare to the little Thai sushi place by my house that has amazing sushi. I ordered the tempura shrimp bento box, and they finally used the traditional presentation I was used to at Bento's in Gainesville, but the food was ... a little lackluster. Their sauteed green beans are amazing as always, and their lo mein stir fry was great, but their jasmine rice was slightly bland and mushy, although not as mushy as the shrimp tempura itself. My boyfriend compared the texture to that of fish sticks. The shrimp was very mushy and had an odd flavor to it. It wasn't bad, per se, but a little odd. The salad on the side was meh (but it's always been that way) and the little fried desert puff was an afterthought. For the price, which is conveniently very cheap ( under 10 bucks), the food was decent, and it filled me up quite well (my bf had to finish the bento box for me, lol). However, it wasn't as great as the first time I went there, and definitely not as great as Bento Blue and Bento Red in Gainesville. I haven't been to those 2 in a little over 2 years now, but from what I remember, their bento boxes were the best. This one, not so much."
11/2/2011,5,Great sushi and even better service. I would highly recommend a visit to Bento Cafe - Dr. Phillips FL
6/26/2013,4,"Bento Cafe is great if youre looking for affordable yet tastey sushi downtown. I normally go here before seeing a movie at the cobb plaza, kind of a one stop shop for a date night."
6/28/2015,5,Really sucks when you have 4 people with separate check s they only say you can use one per table. .management on duty was a kid and doesn't know anything about customer service. So I moved to another table and ate by myself. Jerk. Talking about free appetizer from yelp
4/17/2013,2,"I've been to Bento over 100 times. Their original locations in Gainesville are great. Great food, great service. Now, lets talk about my recent experience at this Sand Lake location. It was disappointing and if I ever eat at this location, I will be getting take out.We arrived at the restaurant with a group of 20 people. We all traveled over 2 hours and everybody wanted to eat here. When we walked through the doors we told the hostess we needed a table for 20, so she started setting it up. We soon found that 6 more people would be joining our party so we asked if she could add anything on or if we could get a table near by. So she walked away and rolled her eyes and whispered stuff under her breath. So we all sat down and she said ""if you have anymore people they will have to wait at the door until there is more room."" After we got our menus it took about 45 minutes for them to take our order. During this 45 minutes all I heard was the hostess complain about how we were taking up all their space that they could have used for other customers. Now, if I am not mistaken, we are customers aren't we? We brought you in 26 people, each spending over $15. It wasn't even busy when we came in, so I have no idea why the hostess was complaining and rolling her eyes. We are giving you business. After people in my party discussed getting up and leaving because of the terrible service, the little hostess ran to the kitchen and did not show face until our food was ready. And even then she kept staring at my party and giving us dirty looks. What kind of people are you hiring bento?Our food was mediocre. Some people didn't get their food until the other people finished, even though the same things were ordered. Why couldn't they cook it all at the same time? Blah.Bento Sand Lake, you have ruined not only my experience, but the other 25 people in my party. What a shame."
5/28/2011,1,"We ordered take out. Katsu chicken udon soup... with breaded chicken? General Tso's Rice Bowl was the worst I've ever had. Chicken tasted old and was not even trimmed, soggy breading. Dumplings seemed like they were fried two days ago. Don't bother."
6/15/2011,4,"I have been eating there for the last several months and have enjoyed each meal more than the last.  Portions are a good size for the price and quality, and the atmosphere is great.  I think they thin out the sriracha sauce though since it does not seem to be as hot as other places.  Aside from that, I love it!"
12/5/2012,1,This used to be a decent place to eat until recently. Gradually the service quality diminished until my final visit. I asked for a table and could see that only five tables were used. There were three servers including the hostess. The hostess explained that it would be a 15 minute wait because they didn't have enough servers. There were only five other parties and two of the three servers were standing around by the register chatting instead of doing their jobs. I will never go back.
5/20/2013,5,"I always make it a point to stop by here whenever I'm in Orlando.  I've first gone to one of the locations in Gainesville, but since I'm in Melbourne now, I can frequent this location much more easily.  I personally prefer this location over the one on Orange Rd, since I don't have to go to the Mochi next door to get my beloved Honeydew Milk Tea like I have to there.I'm not a huge sushi fan, but they definitely have a number of options for people who aren't into sushi.  My regular dish is the Curry Katsu Chicken Rice Bowl.  It's absolutely delicious!  The portions are rather large, however, so I'm never able to finish it.  On rare occasions, if I'm feeling ambitious, I'll order the Miso Soup, which is also very delicious.I'd highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.  It's conveniently located close to Universal Studios, so it's in a prime location for outside visitors!"
9/12/2014,4,it's a one stop shop of basic Asian comfort foods you order the way you like it and the make it
8/3/2014,2,I do love bentos but was somewhat annoyed that I couldn't get fried rice with my bento box.
8/1/2013,2,"Our office is close by, so we often in the past have eaten here for lunch.  The food is good, and the prices reasonable BUT I had a poor service experience the last time I went.  I realize that lunch is semi-self service, but I simply asked the waitress for a fork when she brought the meals to the table.  She looked at me as if I was bothering her, abruptly pointed to the service area, and told me I could get it myself. I didn't want to make it a big deal because I was in a large group of colleagues, but everyone at the table noticed how rude she was, and couldn't believe it!  We saw other servers bringing items to the tables.  Actually, I probably wouldn't have even minded getting the fork myself if the girl was a bit more polite about it. I'm not sure if I'd go back with my co-workers again....all over a fork.  Unfortunate, but there is no excuse for someone being rude to a customer."
2/3/2013,2,"I don't know what's happened to Bento or if it's just this location, but the food is nowhere close to the quality it's been in the past. I've been a long time Bento fan ever since Bento Blue in Gainesville. For some reason, whether it be management or staff, the food and service at Bento on Sand Lake is pretty bad.1. The server comes and takes drink orders and doesn't return for 15 minutes, even though we only asked for waters. 2. When we decide to order Milk Tea with Pearls, the pearls have a strange veggie after-taste. 3. It takes 30-40 minutes for our food order to come out.4. The hot food was flavorless.5. The sushi rice around the sushi tasted like normal white rice that was left at room temperature. 6. They give you watered down eel sauce and charge for it. 7. And all this time the server is nowhere to be found even though there are only 4 tables in the entire restaurant that are occupied. I'm not sure what happened, Bento, but the Sand Lake locations has become an increasingly disappointing venue to have lunch/dinner."
4/6/2014,4,"For the price and amount of food you get i'm a fan. My go to dish here is the curry katsu, always love a dish like this. The curry is very unique and has a decent spice to it . Although no my favorite place to go eat chicken katsu it's in my top 5 for gainesville at least."
4/10/2014,4,Easy.  Affordable.  Order at counter and then they serve it to you.  Lemon roll was different. Open all day which is unique in this part.   Most sushi places close at 3
8/1/2014,4,The food was delicious. It sort of feels like a mix between restaurant and quick service. It was very clean and modern and in a great upscale area. The prices are pretty decent for the portion size and quality of the meal. I've been back numerous times....and who doesn't love Chewy Boba Tea.
2/24/2012,2,"I was very disappointed with the quality of their nigiris. Prices are the same as if I went to a ""real"" sushi restaurant and the quality can be compared to supermarket sushi. I actually have had better sushi at Gelson's supermarket in California. The bento box was ok, therefore the 2 stars."
4/5/2014,4,My family enjoyed a late dinner at Bento Cafe. The best thing about this place is the value. Super affordable large shareable portions and lots of choices. The service was attentive.
2/25/2010,1,"We had the worlds crappiest waitress. She had a horrible attitude all night, blaming us for an order she messed up, slamming down our trays, ignoring us purposefully, talking down to us, and trashing us to her other coworkers...we will never return. Shame on you Bento for hiring such a pathetic waitress."
4/23/2010,2,"Discover this place on web last week. Decide to give it a try yesterday and it was not good! Same as other fusion deco asian restaurant, their food taste bland, salty. Service was bad, it took long time for people to come to serve! Noodle and chicken are overly cook, more towards burn!  I was there for spicy beef noodle soup~but I was disappointed, it was just a bowl with 3 pieces beef and small amount of noodle, no spicy, no salt, no sugar, nothing. prices are cheap compare to other restaurant around this area, but i rather spend more for the delicious food than spends less money on the awful one!"
6/5/2012,4,Visiting Orlando. Fresh sushi at a great price. Try the Mexican roll.
8/30/2011,3,We had Katsu Rice Ball and Katsu Bento Box. I liked them and I ate them all. Our waitress was nice and friendly too. Only the problem I had was that we waited for 8-10 to order(We didn't even have a water). It was before 4pm so it wasn't the busiest time in a day. We didn't have lunch yet so we were so hungry..
9/27/2011,4,"i liked this place once i entered. there were TVs (so i could watch football)! very fusiony. a good place to have lunch/dinner and the menu was useful. also there was bubble tea! the price is set for lunch and dinner, so doesn't really hurt your pocket. servers were courteous. i would say the only thing that prevents me from giving this place a perfect score is experience, because each time can be different, but i will def. go back here when i hit up Orlando."
6/9/2011,5,favorite hangout of mine. everything is really good for an asian fusion restaurant. happy hour during the weekdays have buy 2 sushi get 1 free. noodle bowls are excellent. the curry katsu pork is excellent. boba tea is good here too!
4/17/2012,4,"Went here on a Tuesday evening; it was easy to get a table. Service was friendly and prompt. Menu is very broad; lots of choices of sushi, noodle and rice dishes, and bento boxes. We had a little bit of everything: two different makis, a noodle soup, a bento box, a noodle bowl, and three drinks. All for only $50! Fresh, tasty food and a great value."
4/21/2013,5,"I came down to Orlando from Boston for a family vacation and I was told by many people to eat at Bento Cafe. Two of the four days we were here in Orlando, we ate lunch here. It was a great experience all in all! We got sat right away by a very nice hostess. Our waitress attended us very quickly and recommended some amazing dishes. Our waitress knew the menu very well. My little sister had an allergy and our waitress recommended a lot dishes for her that would not danger her. The food came out quick (we order a couple rolls and some bento boxes) and it was hot and prepared nicely. We got the same waitress twice (an Asian female named Kim) and she was very friendly and optimistic. She always had a smile on and she seemed to be very alert. The whole staff was alert both times we went. She always checked up on us to make sure everything was ok. She recommended some boba teas for my little sisters and they absolutely loved it. We got 2 strawberry blended ice with boba for them and I got the vanilla milk tea with boba.I don't know if it our waitress or maybe the staff for both times that we had went, but i had a great experience here, along with my whole family. If i had the chance to come here again, I definitely would."
7/31/2009,2,"I have been to this particular Bento Cafe three times, and each time it proves to be just as disappointing as the first time, nothing has changed. Yes, the price is decent and the decor is modern and hip. However, the service and food is below par. Maybe I'm being a bit too difficult,  but I do not understand why I am tipping when I'm getting barely any service. The only time I see the server is when they come to bring me the food, and I have to go get the drinks myself in a flimsy plastic cup. They walk around and socialize, and not once ask me how my food is. I ordered some sushi rolls, that took way to long to come out. Mind you, I came in after the lunch rush and before dinner, there was maybe 2 or 3 other tables there. I do not understand why it takes so long for a three sushi rolls to come out. Not only that, it comes out one by one. I find myself finishing the first roll, waiting a good 10 minutes for the second roll, and then 5 minutes for the last roll after I finished my second. And when I look over to the sushi bar, I see the sushi chef laughing with the server and not making my rolls. Unacceptable. Their bento box is nothing to die for. In the description, it says you get noodles and other sides. I didn't get any noodles and one side of beans. Let's just say I will never come back again, I've been here 3 times and each time I've waited way too long for my food when each time it wasn't busy and the service barely existed. Let me just say I'm not anti-Bento at all, I've been to the one downtown several times, as well as the one in gainesville, and each time I left happy and satisfied. I rather make that few extra miles to the downtown location where I know I will never be disappointed."
8/16/2010,5,The sushi was fresh as always and the udon soup was great. My friend also had the pho noodle soup which he said was great as well. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants fresh sushi and great noodle soup
5/8/2012,3,Same as place downtown but very slow at this location. Food is good but it seems to always take 30-40 minutes for food after ordering whether the place is empty or full.
6/6/2011,3,"their gucci roll is good, some servers look like they wanna die but its cool i guess if u wanna eat in a grave yard"
11/18/2022,4,"We were in the mood for some Asian food during our road trip so we decided to checkout Bento Asian.Here's my take on the experience:Quality of food:  Good. We tried the Bento Box that came with white rice, ginger salad, lo mein, and garlic string beans. For protein, we chose the general tso chicken which is wok fried with red and green bell pepper. We also got a side of two egg rolls. The garlic string beans were simply delicious. The general tso chicken could have been a tad bit crispier. The egg rolls, though nice and crispy, were encased in a lot of oil and I had to use quite a few paper napkins to soak it all out.Décor: modern. This place felt like it could be in LA.Cleanliness: good. The tables and the bathroom was clean.Service: good. Our cashier was pleasant and told us everything about the menu options.Price: expensive. The Bento Box was $15 which is a little steep considering this is a fast-food style restaurant. The egg rolls were $6 which is also a little bit more than expected. They also sell sushi rolls and the cheapest roll on the menu, spicy tuna roll, was $9 which is more than I have ever seen at just about any reputable sushi place.If you're in the mood for some decent albeit expensive Chinese/Japanese fast food then check out Bento."
12/12/2022,1,Awful awful!  Disgusting teriyaki chicken! Slimy and all dark meat without informing you on menu.  Will NEVER go back!
11/10/2022,3,"I was craving for some sushi and I really wanted to try something different than the last time I had sushi, so I decided to give these guys a try and to be honest I really enjoyed the signature Crunch sushi it  had tuna, crab, cream cheese, avocado, spicy Mayo, eel sauce and panko fried,it was very flavorful, crunchy  and tasty, so as for the sushi I definitely give it 9/10.The service in there needed some improvement because I called in and order my sushi  to avoid wait time and when I arrived to pick up my order I still had to wait  10 mins which didn't make any sense at all because at that point I might as well did walk in and place my order and waited. The ambience of this place was cool, nice house music going, the decor was pretty and colorful, the store was well cleaned (I don't know if it's because it was closer to closing time) but it was definitely nice and tidy and the bathroom was also clean only thing the trash needed to be taken out. I can say I'll definitely give them another try just to see if they will improve on their service. The service is only reason they got a stars deducted. Hope I was able to help the next person before visiting ."
12/13/2022,1,"I have ordered from here three times and two of the three times my order has been missing major portions of food. This last time we ordered delivery and ended up with 1/2 our dishes. We called the restaurant and we're informed we could come pick up the other half and told  ""they were busy"" instead of an apology for the error."
12/13/2022,1,"We have ordered three times from them, and they have messed up our order the last two times. The last time they completely left off the sushi portion of the order, which was most of the food. When we called to remedy the order, they were less than helpful. We don't plan to order from them again."
8/1/2022,5,Came here mid-day Sunday really craving sushi. Unfortunately this location was short on staff and couldn't serve sushi or poke bowls. We stayed regardless. I ordered the udon noodle soup with tempura shrimp and my husband ordered the curry chicken. Both were good. The staff was super nice and attentive. Atmosphere was spacious and clean.
8/14/2021,3,"I ordered the udon noodle bowl ($13) and red coconut curry bento box ($15), and both were very tasty and flavorful! The noodles were cooked to perfection, and they definitely gave plenty of extra soup broth. The bento was much more worth it in terms of value though, and I wasn't full at all from the noodle bowl.My main concerns were the fact that I had placed the pick-up order for 11:30am to avoid the lunch rush, and even though there was not a single customer in sight, they still brought the food out 5 minutes late. One of the staff members preparing the food was not wearing their mask as well."
12/19/2021,4,"Not sure why they have so many bad reviews. First time stopping in today. You order and then they bring out your meals. I got the milk tea boba (delicious, not too sweet and boba is fresh), I got the Hawaiian poke bowl (tuna, mango, red onion, edamame, over sushi rice), it was pretty good. They have a lot of choices on the menu. The hubby had Korean rice bowl and it was huge and he said it was very tasty. Look forward to coming back to try something else. Staff is very efficient and friendly!"
7/8/2022,5,"Fast, easy and tasty! I chose the poke bowl which was very tasty, my husband and my friends had fried rice which they also liked and the portion is very generous! For sure I will be back again to try other options."
10/15/2022,5,"Been here mutiple times and it has improved immensely. Was celebrating my confirmation with bento for lunch, and on our way home from church we got a call saying the catering order couldn't be made. Called Bento and they handled the situation seamlessly. Didn't have to wait extra time and they handled it all incredibly. Despite the slow UberEats order I just recently had, which included soggy spring rolls and cold food, their food is amazing and the UberEats was the problem not them."
10/6/2021,2,"I decided to make a pickup order during my lunch time since Bento is a good option for quick and healthy food. Unfortunately, it was not a pleasant experience. It took them my entire lunch hour to make just one bowl.I ordered just one bowl and went to pick it up after receiving a notice that my order was ready. Well, I arrived at the place to find out that they didn't make my order yet, because apparently they were having problems with the app. I was surprised but I understand mistakes happen so I was willing to wait a few minutes. While I'm waiting, I see the staff placing several take out orders on the pickup counter. Apparently, they did not put any emphasis on completing my order, which was already late, so it went to the bottom like it was a new order. This second mistake doubled the time of the wait and I only had one hour for lunch. It made it even more upsetting that no one from the staff tried to make up for the mistakes. They were avoiding eye contact eveytime they took an order out. I had to get their attention to ask what happened to my order. The situation was poorly handled all around. The food was good and ingredients were fresh but it was not a great bowl. Needless to say, I lost my entire lunch time waiting for a simple bowl. This location is in desperate need of better management and basic customer service skills."
11/26/2021,5,This place is great! The food tasted great with good quality and it was warm. The portion sizes are just right. The staff is friendly and the dining area and bathrooms were very clean. I recommend this place.
9/3/2022,1,Food was ok. Extremely high priced for what you get. They were also short staffed so they couldn't offer a good portion of their menu. Won't be back.
8/22/2021,5,"Ok so where to start...... if I could give it 10 stars  I would. extremely clean location for sure. Bathrooms and all!food was on point! I had the curry and it reminded me of my time in Japan! The food was served perfectly and tasted amazingly, Down to the egg rolls! Crisp and hot and flavorful. If you have picky kids like I do give them some chicken it's great and mine ate it up soooo win win people! I'd come back again for sure"
4/27/2022,5,"Love this place, really interesting foods/sushi and sauces. Foods seems fresh and made to order. The tile work on the wall sets the mood. Very casual and relaxing. Would be a good spot to chill."
9/8/2022,1,Very inconvenient that they don't accept cash. Not sure why they thought that would help their business or when people still use cash to tip their staff.
10/13/2022,2,"They got my order wrong and it took very long after when they said it would be ready, they added ingredients and left out others, overall would not recommend."
3/23/2021,3,"Stopped by for a quick dinner with a friend on a weeknight. We did dine in. The restaurant is very nice. I ordered a Szechuan chicken bento box, Tom yum soup with shrimp and lychee honey boba slush. The food is ok for quick service Asian food. My Tom Yum soup was spicy which was fine. Shrimp was not deveined... I enjoyed my bento box. The salad that came with it lacked dressing though. The portion was good as I had leftovers. Enjoyed my lychee honey boba slush even though it was on the sweet side. I would stop by for a quick meal if I was in the area."
12/10/2021,5,"Always a go to spot for me, love this place. But I wanted to comment specifically on the decor in here vs other locations. LOVE LOVE LOVE this brighter ambiance. Some of the other locations are dark, black and depressing. Will definitely come back to this one"
8/7/2021,2,"We've order from here a few times now, all through Uber Eats. I really wanted to love the food, but each time the food has been less than tasty and consistently leaves me with an upset stomach. It's also overpriced for basic Asian food."
2/7/2021,4,"Soft opening... We ordered a variety of things. We liked the Japanese bagel (JB bagel) roll the most, and thought the sauce for the pork dumplings was too salty. This location doesn't quite have all the dishes the other locations have, but I understand it's not located in the most populated part of town either. One strange thing is that they don't have tap water. Machine is not working, which is understandable during this time, but they could have pitcher of water to share..."
3/7/2021,4,We went yesterday around 6:20 the cashier was super helpful. We got a number and sat to wait. We got our food to go. It took about 42 minutes to get our food. We asked a worker if that was normal and she said yes when it is that busy. Besides that the food looked delicious and tasted that way too. I would definitely go back and get some more sushi or a poke bowl again. A great addition to lake Nona!  But I'll probably order ahead next time to skip the wait.
8/30/2021,1,24 dollars for a bento teriyaki chicken with extra chicken. First off extra chicken really? Might as well not paid extra. Chicken still had fat in it attached. Ginger salad looked sad and noodle tasted normal. Teriyaki was sauce on the side for the chicken so it's not cooked with it.What a disgrace!!!
2/8/2022,4,Overall always a clean and quick. Food is always great. Only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the drink selection isn't the greatest besides this I love this spot and I have returned about 8 times already. Thank you again
5/17/2021,5,"Food was hot and delicious, service was prompt, and atmosphere can't be beat! Love the vibe in here. Can't wait to come back."
6/6/2021,5,Tons of variety of awesome foods from poke to sushi to boba and more. I especially love the interior vibe. That Koi fish ceiling is super cool!! Customer service is solid too. I just found out they have their own app - perfect for ordering takeout.
4/26/2021,2,"Went for the first time today.... I failed to look at the prices and spent $50 on 3 bowls, not realizing it was an additional $4.50 for fried rice in the bowl. I think it's just higher priced than panda and we weren't really satisfied with the food. I guess it maybe more suited for sushi eaters but if you love fried rice, this is not it. You're better off going somewhere more authentic and getting more for your money."
7/23/2021,5,"Oh it was sooo good. Driving through on vacation and the reviews looked good so decided to check it out. Didn't want fast food so it was the perfect sit down but not too sit down restaurant for our traveling meds: Order at the counter, they bring our your food fairly quickly and you move on. They were quick, food was fragrant and delicious and the place (including bathroom) was very clean. They even had staff walking around grabbing trays and trash. They keep a nice space there. Pricing isn't the cheapest but bento boxes, poke and sushi typically aren't for those looking for low-budget dining. Family of 4 spent about $60 including drinks."
10/7/2021,1,Just tried to dine in with my family of 5. We were told for dine in - we needed to order on the kiosk. I asked if that was the only option since it was our first time we were not familiar with the menu and she said yes because they're busy. We left and then witnessed them take an order for a single person that walked in immediately after us.
5/1/2021,2,Definitely not impressed!! I give the restaurant 3 in customer service but Food was definitely a 2 because it was Luke warm and tasted like it was a reheat. Looks pretty good but it wasn't what we expected.
12/6/2021,2,"The first time I went to bento was a week or two ago and I was so excited to find Asian noodle cuisine that could easily accommodate a vegan diet. The woman at the counter asked the cooks if the lo mein noodles were vegan and replied those. I was also happy to see rice noodles for when I prefer a gluten free option, but decided to splurge for the wheat lo mein noodles. It was good but wished I had gotten tofu.I just got back from there and everything has changed. The rice noodles are no longer an option, and the lady at the counter told me the lo mein noodles are not in fact vegan. This left the only option being udon which are not my favorite. She then described sriracha as ""sweet"" which confused me. She was really nice don't get me wrong, but the sauce I got (gochujang garlic) was not at all sweet, and very spicy. The lady was very kind in attempting to accommodate my vegan diet so this poor review isn't about her, but about the changes to the menu as of a week ago. I was highly disappointed to learn that any changes to the included vegetables would cost a lot more money and removing vegetables wouldn't deduct from the price. It wasn't very accommodating and options were limited. The last straw for me was opening my udon tofu bowl and seeing the amount of red/green peppers that were included. I counted.. 5 small pieces of red/green peppers. Picture included.Very disappointed with the changes and limited choices. Will not be returning, even though the staff was friendly and helpful both times."
9/28/2021,5,Seriously so much better than when they opened. Everything went to be going well. Great food . Ok price. We had bento boxes today and will be back. Seems like staff know how to take care of the place. Clean. Very nice.
12/17/2020,5,"I can't tell you how excited I am to have bento come to lake Nona. I been waiting for at least two years or more since they announced that they are coming. So I of course have to visit the store during their soft opening. It is still currently under soft opening as of today.  Came here twice for take out as they are still in training so their dining room is not open. To live up to the Yelp elite style, I try different ordering methods such as ordering in person and also through their online website for pick up. Both methods were easy to follow and seamless! The interior design is just spectacular and beautiful (look at that koi fish mosaic ceiling tiles). The space is very spacious and clean. The food is awesome and delicious just like their other branches. The staff knows their menu well and the whole experience were very well which I wouldn't have guess they are still working out some kirks or are training. Looking forward to visiting them on their grand opening! Be sure to check them out when you are in the area!"
1/28/2021,4,"Love the creativity of the bento boxes! Each box comes with a salad, noodles, crispy cinnamon chips, rice, and your choice of protein. I tried the Korean veggies and they were amazing! Good flavor but a little onion heavy, I was having bites of just onion and I still left some in my box. The pao pao chicken is their signature sauce and I can see why! It's incredible!!! It's creamy and salty and good on both chicken and tofu! It's a little expensive and they don't have a lunch menu, it doesn't really fill me up for dinner but I love it as a healthy lunch portion. I also got taro milk tea but they gave my chocolate milk tea instead - it was good, but not what I was hoping for."
12/17/2020,2,"I ordered this through door dash. I was excited to try it because it's nearby and looks cute. I ordered the mt Fuji sushi roll, and the sesame chicken bento box. Also egg rolls. The only thing I really enjoyed was my sushi. Everything else was not good. Although it was presented beautifully - awesome to go containers to split up the salad from rice and chicken . So to start with the egg rolls  : it came With 2 which was nice. However I did not like them at all.  The roll was not crunchy- it was ""mushy"". I ended up throwing them out. Now to the bento box: you would think it would be custom for a ginger dressing on the salad - but no, they used someSort of sweet and sour sauce as dressing. May work for some people, but DEF not me!!! The chicken was supposed to be sesame chicken - the chicken tasted fake and there was no flavor. It most definitely did not taste like sesame chicken. I could not eat this. The vegetables were green beans. Since when do Asian places serve green beans as vegetables ?! The only part of the bento box I liked was my white rice - which is the only food I ate out of the entire entree. A waste of $30 to be honest . Would I go back? Only for the sushi"
1/14/2021,1,"The name is very misleading, they don't actually have nigiri or sashimi (what Americans think of as sushi), they only have maki (rolls) and poke bowls.  Sign on the door says they require masks... how are you supposed to eat with a mask on? Seems dumb.  Very disappointed, I was looking forward to some good sushi."
10/22/2021,2,I am quite disappointed in the pick up service I got. I gave my name Sullivan to the African American lady and she said they were working on it. I came in at 4:45. That same lady put pick up order in window and I stood there for 25 minutes waiting for My order patiently. She then goes to kitchen to see what's up then asks me my name and I give it to her and she says oh it's here in the pick up shelf. She then told me she thought my last name was Solomon. My question is why didn't she check with Me after she received my order....and they weren't busy at all. I should have talked to a manager but needed to get home I've worked carryout places before and this was first time at bento and this had soured me in returning.
2/17/2022,5,I've been here twice now and the food was perfect both times. It's a new family favorite for sure.
1/10/2021,4,What can I say ?!! I love me Chinese and Japanese food. Especially chines take out. Bento gives me all of that without having that greasy feeling in my stomach once I'm done eating my combination number 7. The udon noodles are beyond delicious especially the sesame oil noodles. If you love dumplings then let me recommend to you Bento's dumplings that are incredibly fresh and tasty. So far we have ordered a number of times using the mobile app. Only feedback I would give them would be to have a separate section for online/mobile pickups and focus on some social distancing in the dining area. Other than that it's a solid place to go.
5/18/2021,4,"The food here is delicious, and their portions are very generous, but you WILL be waiting awhile to get it! This may be simply because they are a new restaurant, but I always wait around 20+ minutes for my food (which is pretty long for a quick service)! However their boba is usually done pretty fast, and it always tastes excellent. They have run out of large cups and honey boba before (twice, with months in between the two events) so you may want to call ahead to check."
2/20/2021,4,"Although I haven't had the opportunity to dine in at this new Bento location yet, I have ordered takeout from them 4-5 times already! Their Pad Thai is spicy and so flavorful. Their sushi is fresh and delicious, and I'm also a huge fan of their bulgogi! Bento boxes are a wonderful, affordable choice too. I'm excited to dine in once things ease up a bit with Covid, and experience the ambiance. Definitely recommend!"
6/4/2021,5,"Great food, the service is fast, and the workers are helpful! I'll definitely be coming back."
2/13/2021,5,I love Bento and am so glad that they've finally opened one in Lake Nona! I get the tofu wok fried rice and am always satisfied with taste and portion. Super yummy!
1/27/2021,1,"We ordered to go, and got to the restaurant at the time they said our order would be done. After waiting in line, we get to the front, and the girl says if you are picking up it's that line only. Almost everyone in the line was picking up, so they took a person way in the back of the line that was putting in an order.  Well, in the pick up line there is someone putting in a order which took about 10 minutes. So, the food is sitting there while we are waiting for the person to put their order in. If you are going to send everyone in one line to pick up their orders which takes about a minute to get the order and pay, why would you allow someone to put their order in instead of sending them to the other line!? So frustrating, they need to figure out a better process where people picking up can get in and out!"
2/27/2021,5,I have only ordered delivery from Bento and the sushi is always SO FRESH! Consistently delicious. My favorites are the Florida roll and Mex roll.
2/11/2021,5,Food was delicious!! The quality of the food and the price you get it for is a steal! Make sure to get the Mt. Fuji sushi!!!!
8/8/2021,5,Good food with good prices. Great boba teas as well! Staff was nice and covid friendly environment.
8/16/2021,2,"I like some of the dishes (spicy creamy chicken, for example) and sushi is decent, but this place had a bad smell.. like bathroom odor the last two times I tried to go. I thought the first time was a fluke, but it happened again and I left without ordering. I'm not about to order sushi from somewhere that smells rotten inside."
1/9/2021,5,Second trip to Bento. Poke bowl was great. Everything tastes fresh. Will return. Nice atmosphere.
4/26/2021,2,"Food is good but boy be aware of ordering during their busy hours!If you do, you'll possibly be waiting a very long time even when ordering through app! We witnessed chaos and 4 customers getting refunds. As we waited patiently and kept being told by very sweet associates may I add, that our order should be next. Well an hour and 15 minutes later we found out Order was skipped. Manager came and refunded us just like she did with many before us . It's unfortunate but it's been chaotic there since they opened and they can't seem to get it together. Staff in the front though is very very sweet!"
2/26/2021,5,"I've been going to Bento for years, mostly for lunch at the downtown location. I was so excited for the new location to open near my home and sinking my teeth into the delicious special Mexican roll for the first time in a year was just...magic. Food is just as good at this location. They have remembered all items for takeout and food has been ready on time."
2/3/2021,3,It wasn't bad.....it wasn't good either. It was just sorta average Asian food.  We all ordered boxes and some sides. Sadly we won't try it again.
1/24/2021,3,Arrived for take out.  Took 35 minutes to get 2 meals.  Tom yum soup was not edible.   Too hot to eat.  I like spicy and have had many bowls of this soup and this was terrible.
1/16/2021,2,"The food is the same quality as other bento locations. The interior is really nice. The service is, however, is not great. We have tried here (to go) 3 or 4 times. Each time, something has been wrong, either we have had to wait twice as long as expected or something was missing. The most recent time, we placed an order on their website and after 30 minutes arrived there to them saying they didn't have our order (and we weren't the only ones that this happened to that night)."
8/23/2022,4,"BENTOOOO! Bento has become my favorite place recently. My friends and I go quite often and it has become an all time favorite. We all have very different taste, but it accommodates us all. One of my friends like an avocado sushi roll and I like the most loaded roll there is but it works for us! Their pick up service is also very efficient especially since most of the food is cold so you don't have to worry about your food getting cold if it's supposed to be warm! Bento definitely satisfies my sushi fix!"
10/9/2022,1,"So disappointed in this bento location.  I ordered a poke bowl and soup for dinner tonight and upon delivery, I received one bowl that was completely different than what I had ordered. After receiving a refund, I tried ordering again, hoping that I might receive the correct food this time... to no avail. Instead I received another incorrect bowl with only half of the ingredients that I had ordered.  I didn't bother to get a refund this time because I'm sure they'd just think I'm trying to scam them, which is not my intention. Was hoping for the correct order, but I guess the saying ""fool me twice, shame on me"" is accurate here.  I am extremely disappointed in the lack of accuracy that this location has provided and very annoyed that I did not receive what I paid for."
11/9/2020,2,"Usually when I can't decide what to order my go to is either sushi or good o'l fries. I know sounds basic but not the point of this review. This place came in my recommendations and decided to try it out. I ordered fried dumplings and their sushi bento box. The dumplings were okay, definitely had better. The sauce that accompanies the dumpling had a dominant ginger flavor so for all you ginger lovers out there you might just like it. Now the sushi came in a cute and neat to go box. The size of the sushi itself was small which isn't really a nad thing. Along with the sushi you get a cucumber salad and a garden salad ( guessing ) which has this sweet-ish dressing which isn't bad considering I'm not into sweet dressings. I love spicy food. I ordered california roll ( this comes with the bento box ), spicy tuna and mex roll. They're okay, nothing with a wow factor. Definitely not what I'd consider for a Friday night feel good take out night."
5/3/2021,5,Absolutely fantastic! Bobo tea was on point! Sushi was fresh and delicious! Boyfriend loved his stirfry! Definitely a great place to get some authentic Japanese fast food for lunch!
4/24/2021,5,Ordered via door dash. Food was perfect. Thai tea was probably the best I ever had in my life. So flavorful and yummy!  Tuna and salmon poke bowl was great.
3/21/2022,1,I received the wrong items and I'm not able to eat what they sent. I contacted them and was told their system isn't able to send me a replacement. The best they could do was offer a partial refund???  Why would you expect me to pay for items that I didn't receive??? Please work out your customer service issues...
1/31/2021,1,After sending them the pictures and emailing back and forth after she asked me to send more info about the time of order and the card I used the manager never reimbursed my order. Pitiful and never again.
11/17/2020,5,"Accidentally ordered from this location instead of downtown Orlando bento on DoorDash which I usually order from cause I thought this location was closed. But to my surprise our 2 poke bowls and Orange chicken bowl (with extra chicken) tasted amazing! Everything was super fresh (raw fish/avocados) and I honestly got way more wonton chips and fried garlic and onion then I get at the downtown or university location. I love Bento chains, I've been eating there all throughout college the past 4 years and this location wasn't bad at all FOOD wise! This location is also closer to my apartment so I'll be ordering from here from now on!  I give it 5 out of 5 because my food was amazing and I think this location needs a higher rating."
3/23/2022,2,"Well, it was good for a while, at least.  But then they cut their menu and stopped caring about quality.  Avoid this location.  It's just crappy fast food now."
3/23/2022,5,"This place good as hell I can't believe I live mad close to this place and ain't no one tell me? Tofu good as hell! Veggie options good as hell, broccoli bussDOWN!"
10/5/2020,4,"Stopped by this new location on my way home from work one night. It was easy to order online and they had my order ready earlier them expected which was nice.  This is a take out and delivery only location. All employees I saw working had gloves and masks on which was nice to see. They had everything packaged nicely with chopsticks and utensils as well as condiments, they even included the extra sauce I asked for (eel sauce) for my sushi roll since it wasn't on their sauce list to get as an extra sauce. I got the Chicken Teriyaki Noodle bowl for my husband (no pics), a Bamboo roll for me which was really good especially with the extra eel sauce, I also got a side salad which was ok, the ginger dressing was good, but wasn't enough for all the salad they give you. I also got the Build a poke bowl which was awesome, just wish you could add more toppings (I like mine loaded lol). Overall it was good and we will order again I'm sure."
3/16/2021,1,"Called before ordering to see if it was possible to add grilled onions to an order. Lady on the phone told us we cannot order over the phone and that they only accept orders online but to add them online in a note. There was no place to add the note online so after placing the order online I called back and was told that if it's not available online, they can't do it...Weird way to lose my business and get a bad review. I'll continue going to the one downtown that is so significantly better than this location."
11/2/2020,1,"It's so sad. The food is great here, but the owner is a rude and angry man. I had been standing in the pick up area unacknowledged for approximately four minutes so I called out ""excuse me!"" Into his kitchen. He then emerged, not a ""hi can I help you? And said I should not be yelling at him in his restaurant. I had just come to pick up my order (which was ready at 12:15 and it was now 1 o'clock.) I must have mistakenly assumed that I could run in,  pick up my lunch and leave, without having to wait for him to saunter up to the counter with a really bad angry attitude. Unfortunately, I won't be able to eat here anymore, but I plan to go to another Bento box restaurant even though it's out of my way. It'll be difficult to swallow the lunch I just ordered( $50 for with a 15% tip for hopefully, his poor employees.)after this unpleasant experience. Good luck with your franchise, sir."
11/30/2020,4,Good sushi no complaints. Sweet staff and very fast service. Due to Covid I did a sushi dinner in the house.
7/19/2021,1,Disappointing Uber Eats order: missing sauce on entree and boba for boba tea. Cold food. Will not order from here again.
9/26/2020,1,"I ordered for takeout on Yelp.  Grubhub was supporting the order and sent me notice of time to pickup.  Order was supposedly ready but no one came up to hand it to me.  The waiting room was crowded.  I waited just outside the door.  The location is a shared kitchen for several restaurants - Bento Express, Lucky Dragon, etc. The food was cold and no taste.  This was a very bad experience."
10/4/2020,5,"Saw Bento pop up in the Conway plaza nearby and was super excited! I normally go for their bowls, but in the time of COVID when we're not eating out but more ordering in, and we're hesitant to order raw fish from too far a distance, I was having a craving for sushi. We ordered three rolls (the crunch, the special Mexican, and the hot lava) and the krab Rangoon. The online portal was easy to navigate, and the delivery was more prompt than the estimated time we were provided. The food was absolutely delicious! The portions were generous- we were both stuffed- and I was especially fond of the special Mexican. Excited to have this location in the neighborhood! We will definitely be ordering again!"
10/6/2020,2,"I was very excited to see there was a closer Bento Box near me rather than going all the way to UCF for it. I honestly should've just went to that one because this sushi does not taste fresh at all, and this is just an express chain."
10/9/2022,5,Amazing food amazing service. Coke machine is fire. Go here every week. Love it. Worth every penny and is well priced.
12/12/2022,3,"Katsu curry was watery, didnt really taste the curry. Other than that, food was okay. Good for a quick and affordable meal. Salad and dressing + green beans were yummy!"
1/6/2022,4,"I had no idea Bento served chicken katsu curry, and it was delicious! They have multiple options, but I think Japanese curry is the best pairing. The rice bowl has gone up in price considerably, but it's still a notable amount of food. I just wish they served more curry considering the disproportionate serving sizes. Since it was my first time at a larger location, I also tried the passion fruit boba and the Florida sushi roll. The boba is a little small for the price, but it was tasty! I also loved my roll, but they forgot the masago and the dipping sauces would have costed fifty cents extra...so it was a little plain taste-wise. Overall, worth the visit and decent variety."
4/19/2022,4,"Fast casual, fantastic food, excellent value. Bento is popular with students and visitors. The Poke Bowls were the favorite at our table. It was a quick lunch visit. The egg roll was so good, we ate it before I could snap a pic!"
2/3/2022,5,"My friends and family in Florida rave about this place and so I had to give it a try. The food is tasty and reminds me of all the comfort food I'd eat back when I was growing up in Japan.Even though its not the hardest thing in the world to make, I really loved their katsu curry. I can eat that all day. In addition to the curry, I also tried out their sushi and it tasted pretty good. 10/10 I'd def recommend this to a friend (which my friends did to me haha).Location wise, Bento is located right next to UCF so its very assessable to students!"
2/18/2022,5,"Had a yummy dinner at bento! First time here and it was a smooth process. The guy taking our order was knowledgeable and answered any questions we had. All the food was great, yummy, hot, and fresh! I'd come back here again, we'll worth it I thought!"
4/2/2021,5,"Is that a Sushi in your pocket.. or are you just happy Sashimi?? Uhh anyways.. lolHad some Bento delivered on this Friday and a good one at that!Got the Large Sushi Bowl - Tuna, Salmon, Spicy TunaToppings - Edamame, Jalapenos, Wakame (seaweed salad), Spicy Cucumber, Wasabi, CucumberAlso has pictured is a Jasmine Milk Tea w/ BobaThe Proteins and ingredients were fresh so there will be a Round 2 in the future!"
9/20/2021,4,"Surprisingly good food at this place. We ordered takeout and when we arrived the food was ready. That is pretty unusual. We got our stuff and went home. We got sushi rolls (some vegan and some with fish), a chicken katsu, miso soup and a red curry tofu bento box. I must say that I enjoyed everything, although the miso soup was a bit salty. I got a roll that had fried shrimp in it and it was really good. The red curry was also really good, and spicy. The bento box was a very good deal, and I really enjoyed it. I stole a piece of the chicken katsu and it was fried to perfection. It was also thick and well seasoned. We got a sweet and spicy sauce with it and it was spot on. Everyone was happy with their food. Solid 4 stars."
9/26/2022,1,"although the food here is pretty good, the service is awful. Not only did we wait 1 hour for our bento box, they employees gave us horrendous glares. 10/10 do NOT recommend... go knights charge on After further consideration they gave us miso soup for the inconvenience... 9/10 don't go here"
2/27/2021,3,"Bento is one of my goto places for quick Sushi. While quick is not what this location is known for. The flavors are consistent and fresh.  I would highly recommend calling in or ordering online. Even when I put in an online order my wait is consistently 15 - 20 minutes after the time they said it would be available.All in all this location is slower than other bentos I frequent. The restaurant is clean, and the food is really good. I enjoy the bento bowls and the tea."
8/10/2021,3,"I've come to Bento Box a couple of times, and the experience has been good, I have been there  before and during the pandemic and  they have been efficient, it's good, I order, eat and go, sometimes I get my order fast, other takes sometime, in general it's been ok.The last time I went, something happened that was kind of uncomfortable, not enough to say it isn't a good place, more like it has room for improvement. I went there a late afternoon with the family, with my  husband and my 5 year old daughter. I wanted to get some sushi and my daughter wanted some noodles, so we chose to go there because they have both. we went, I ordered the sushi,  and my husband order his meal and a noodle kids meal.  I paid, I assumed everything was ok, and sat. When we got the food, we see that we get rice instead of noodles,  and we let the server know, that we were pretty sure we ordered noodles because it was all the child wanted. We explained the server, and then looked into the receipt, which usually don't get  but that day we did, and yes it says that the kid's meal was rice. We assumed it was some sort of miscommunication, and initially the server told us that no problem that he will give us a side of noodles, and we were ok with  that. Then he came back and said that unfortunately, we couldn't get the noodles, that if we wanted we could head up and purchase the  extra side. At this point, I understand that yes,  I should have checked the receipt after I paid, and didn't, and I could leave it like that, or make my child eat the rice, or I could ask for a manager and maybe they could help, or get up and pay again for noodles. At the end, I decided for the latter, I went to the front and ordered an extra side of noodles. I could have asked for the manager, but I wanted to save my inner Karen for bigger and better occasions, even if I considered I was right, the server was being polite and the end it wasn't his fault, he was doing his job after all. It wasn't a big deal, other than I had to interrupt starting our meals. I can say that  whenever I've had a misunderstanding in other places, whether the food is mixed up or we get the wrong order, we usually get a replacement or the right meal without having to go through hoops. that was kind of like meh. I say it more with the idea that it may be improved for future reference"
6/16/2022,2,"Quality seems to have gone down and price seems to have gone up. So sad. Ever since they removed the Masago from the poke bowls it just hasn't been the same ((the picture is from when they used to have masago :,(  Haven't had a bowl like that since... heartbroken."
11/6/2022,1,"Food took 45 minutes to come out, I don't think the workers know how to do their job. Also, the food was overpriced and horrible."
11/22/2021,3,"Sure I would recommend this spot and I would eat there again. But there are better sushi spots without a doubt. We got some rolls and some noodles and I can say we were happy with our grub. They said 40 minutes till we got our food- we got it in 15, so that was great news."
6/10/2021,5,"I ordered takeout via the Bento app and I was pleasantly surprised that my order looked as good in pickup as it would had I dined in the restaurant even after driving home. Everything tasted excellent and the boba I ordered was made fresh and kept cold. Very refreshing to sip on during my drive home on a hot day. The bursting boba was very cool! I've never had that before and it was like a party in my mouth, LOL! Customer service was great and the tables were clean which is obviously vital nowadays but important no matter what. I'll definitely be back next time I'm near UCF."
10/27/2021,4,"So we're in Orlando passing the time as we missed our flight, and was hanging with my son who attends UCF.  We actually came the night before and we're really hungry and saw this place and thought - why not. They serve bento boxes, Pho and sushi, a winning combination! We tried their chicken teriyaki bento box and 3 rolls, special Mexican, Florida, and Mt. Fiji. The rolls were in expensive and we thought they would be overloaded with rice (to fill you up). They weren't and each roll were 8 pieces. The bento box came with a small thing of noodles, white rice, chicken teriyaki, wonton cinnamon type item, salad and green beans. For a college town, the entire total was rather inexpensive, especially for sushi, but the taste was out of this world! The special mex (I got it without the spicy mayo) was magnificent and the Mt. Fiji roll was SOoo good, you have to try. The Florida roll was also good. The bento box was pretty filling and it fed my wife and I rather well. If in Orlando near UCF and you want a really good Asian place, stop by here - it's literally across the street from the college! So stop by, you'll be glad you did."
6/19/2022,2,Have waited over 30 minutes for fried rice . Resteraunt is probably 20% max occupied . Yes they did warn it might take 20 mins . What I don't like is how there's four people standing around at the sushi bar chatting doing nothing while there's probably one person in the back actually working . I love bentos food but this is unnacceptable at this location . Also didn't have any bobas available they claim and when I asked if I should order a appetizer so I didn't starve while waiting they claimed there was no more of those either .
9/13/2022,1,"I has low expectations of this restaurant and the food exceeded them. It was less good than I imagined it could be. The staff were helpful, but I wouldn't go back for the food."
11/29/2021,1,"Hair in the food. This was literally the most disgusting thing that's ever happened to me while eating. This hair was so long and wrapped into the rice, I almost swallowed it & nearly threw up as I pulled it out of my throat."
1/1/2021,4,"It is my son's birthday, so the meal is his choice. This year he wanted something close to home, without fuss but it had to be good. He recently had tried Bentos with a friend & wanted us all to try it. Bentos is in a plaza across from UCF, sitting amongs other food places, so the parking can be sparse. We lucked out and found one right in front. As we entered I noticed the masks required sign, social distancing markings on the floor, the staff all wearing masks & hand sanitizer dispenser by the register. The tables were not separated enough but we chose a table for six closer to the door. Honestly, most people who came in after us were keeping distant or odering to go. We ordered at the register, we advised that it was our 1st time and she was nice and very patient. She showed us the different options, sauces and sushi. We ordered Mongolian beef & shrimp, with lo mein. Mongolian chicken with lo mein, pau pau shrimp white rice bowl, pau pau shrimp with lo mein & sushi combo box.The food was bought to our table pretty fast. It was all really good. I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of veggies, cooked well. Pau pau sauce os spicy, sweet, creamy. The Mongolian beef and chicken is really good.  The sushi is fresh, flavorful and awesome. We will return."
8/3/2021,3,"It's 4pm, and many items on the menu are out of order :(    My order was prepared in very short time. Food portion and taste is good. I wouldn't recommend milk tea, though. It's wayyyyyyy to sweet"
11/24/2020,4,"**Review of their Uber Eats Deliveries**I have ordered from this establishment through Uber Eats several times and it's been great! I love the options and how they have a great mix of items. Bento boxes are a great way to get a mix of foods you like all in one plate! I love their noodles and their chicken is tasty! They have a fun kid's bento box that our toddler actually LOVES. She enjoys eating the noodles and the chicken is basically their version of chicken nuggets. She is always pleased with the food she gets from here!It's easy to order on the app, and they deliver within the timeframe window they provide.Overall: AGood food delivery service - received hot and fresh and it's tasty!"
12/17/2019,5,"Come here once a week for lunch and have never been disappointed.  Portions are fair and great quality. The bento boxes are great!Updated 12/2019Still come here frequently, staff and food service still Great. In TnT roll is awesome!"
11/3/2019,3,"Arriving here around 11:45am on a Friday before the lunch rush was our luck! Shortly after arriving, the line grew extremely long. Plan your trip accordingly and make sure you have adequate time. I met up with my husband for lunch and decided on trying this place out. After a short walk from the parking garage, we entered and stood in line.  Only about 3-4 people in front of us, it felt like it was taking a long time to take their orders. My husband ordered the tofu yaki udon.  The noodles had a nice texture and bite to them.  This dish was satisfying and savory.  The ginger soy sauce that flavored the noodles was super yummy! I recommend.  I ordered the tofu pad Thai. Sadly, I was disappointed.  I've had pad Thai from many places, but unfortunately the flavor of their pad Thai didn't work with my taste buds.  I feel like it had a strong ginger like taste instead of your traditional peanut sauce flavor.  The nice thing about this was that it was a HUGE serving. I had tons of leftovers.  I'm sure the other choices on the menu are tasty, but I don't think this will be in our normal restaurant rotation."
4/6/2022,4,"Great food, wonderful, good value. There bowls are great and the bento boxes are delicious! I highly recommend the Bento's on University. Yummy yum!"
2/19/2022,4,"Presentation and taste of the food was great, only complaint was they didn't have boba. That being said I'll have to come back and try soon. High recommend if you're looking for something Asian for lunch, great flavors."
8/22/2019,5,"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, but I started seeing bad reviews, so I put it off. I finally ordered take out for my daughter and me and I was NOT disappointed! I was lazy so I wanted to use a delivery service, but the last order ends at 9:30PM.When I walked in to pick up the order, it was bigger than I expected and the bar area was really nice. I noticed that they have happy hour, but I never get out of work early enough to take advantage.My daughter & I each ordered a poke bowl. We had a certain amount of protein, toppings, sauce, etc. when my daughter created hers, she only chose 3 toppings, so the girl who took my order offered to double any 2 of the items!!! We were so excited and we savored every bite. We were not able to finish the whole bowl, so we had enough for leftovers."
12/29/2021,5,"I had the Spicy Donburi and let me tell you. This bowl is really good. It's a very simple bowl and it's flavorful. This is how all restaurants should be. Friendly, clean, and tasteful. P.S. I love their uniforms."
7/7/2019,4,"A fast casual Bento box place?! Where have you been all my life? Plus rice and noodle bowls and a few soups and appetizers?! I did the math and there are infinite combinations to order.Product quality ranged from good to great. All the bentos have the same stuff besides the main dish. I had the Korean steak which was good. Sauce tasted great (but could be a bit spicier!) The beef quality was decent but not amazing. Served with the standard salad with ginger dressing (really sick of this stuff!) A scoop of rice to soak up the sauce. Really nice side of wok fired green beans. I really don't know what to think of the cold sesame noodles. The flavor is good. Don't like it cold. I ate a couple bites but I wish I could sub it out with something else. A standout was the chicken katsu bento. Really perfect.  My son who's diet constitutes of only fried chicken and things covered in cheese loved it. Dumplings were good but the skins were too think and ""bready"". I still ate them all. Sauce was delicious which included some chili oil. Edamame were really good. Crisp and salty. Miso was decent but my son hated the mushroom slices. Odd choice but I bet I would have liked it.  But there are problems here. We ordered 3 bentos and 3 appetizers. They brought out the bentos first. Really? And the place wasn't busy. Very odd and definitely a fumble from the kitchen. And everything came out one at a time. I get it. The kitchen cooks something and sends it out. Still was odd. My wife's main was over salted. And as I said, the beef was ok quality. A bit mealy. Maybe over marinated? Given there are now infinite minus one combinations for me to try, I will be back."
7/3/2020,5,This was a DoorDash Saturday Support Your Local Business Order. I order sushi every Saturday since I cook all week long. Delivery was fast and the rolls were very good. I have to say the Spicy Salmon was my favorite. My husband got the Garlic Broccoli Bento box and the portion was very generous. Daughter got the Katsu Kid box and she approved.
7/4/2022,1,"Let's start by saying I ask if I can swap out the Cali roll in the sushi box. The answer was no and I'm fine with that I'll buy the rolls I want. I wanted a rainbow roll and a Mt. Fuji roll and I was completely fine with paying for both. I pay, I walk to my seat and everything is splendid. I receive a Cali roll (the thing I didn't want) and a rainbow roll. It's fine they messed up my order but I didn't not expect them to tell me it's basically my fault. I had to go pay more since the Mt. Fuji roll cost more(once again I'm fine with this but I didn't expect to pay more after i had already ordered the rolls I wanted). Not only did I have to pay for their mistake they then proceeded to take the Cali roll back that they had dropped off at the table. Now riddle me this bento, why would I pay $18 dollars for a Cali roll and a rainbow roll when I can get a sushi box($15) with a full Cali roll and just order 2 halves of a rainbow roll as the 2 four piece rolls you get in a box? That would give me a full rainbow and full Cali roll. Absolutely appalling."
5/8/2020,4,"My first time having a regular poké bowl. Way better than the hot food since the meats tend to be fatty (I don't like that.) so filling I had to take some home. Convenient location and service. It's quick, close, and pretty good. Not authentic but it's like a Asian chipotle. The fried to go food was hot and ready in advance."
10/10/2018,3,"I'm kind of sad. Let me explain... I'm a long-time patron of Bentos. As a Gator grad, I went to the original location in Gainesville not long after they opened. Then the second location in Gainesville. Then I worked in downtown Orlando for 5 years right after that location opened (and even paid for the sit-down service they forced in us on weekends). Now, probably about a decade after my first Bento visit, I live semi-close to this location near UCF. And it leaves a lot to be desired. I've been here a few times, and always leave feeling slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely edible. ...it's just not as great as it used to be. And the locations don't seem to have much consistency. On this last trip to Bento, I ordered a spicy cream chicken bento box with extra rice instead of noodles and white meat grilled chicken. They forgot the extra rice - which isn't a big deal at all, but the chicken was super dry, flat, and minimal. Luckily I was hungry and still scarfed it all down. They also didn't put the sauce on the chicken at all, but gave me a salad bowl-sized cup of it! I'm not sure why you would ever need that much sauce for a 1/4 cup of grilled chicken, unless you wanted to eat it like soup. (Seriously, I wish I had a picture.)When they first opened at the original location they also gave you these cute little cakes as the dessert in the middle of the box, but now they only give you those crispy wonton noodles with sugary glaze on them. It's obviously a cost-saving mechanism and probably easier, but it's just not great.Overall, it's just not as good of an experience - and it makes me sad to say that, but it's true. Hopefully they will get back up to par soon."
10/24/2021,1,"After a 35 minute wait one of the two meals that we ordered arrived. Several minutes later my meal arrived minus the request of ""no green peppers please"" ... green peppers were front and center. The chicken was mushy and the rice was dry and clumpy. The concession salad  offered for the long wait never materialized. I paid $16,00 for this lack luster meal and poor service. I can not recommend this establishment and will take my money elsewhere."
2/5/2021,1,"My husband and I are avid Bento goers and unfortunately this location was a disappointment. We ordered a poke bowl and boba TO GO at the counter and waited 40 minutes for our ""to go"" order. Keep in mind it's Christmas Eve, 8 ppl working and 2 customers in the store (plus us so 4 ppl total). My poke bowl sat on the counter for 20 minutes and my drink was given to me without my mango popping boba (I was charged for this). Upon receiving my already sat out poke bowl and telling the manager I was missing the popping boba he added it and we were on our way. Go to the Oviedo location it's a lot better!"
1/20/2020,4,"This restaurant serves bento box in interesting concept:  Asian cuisines.  You can choose your choice of meat and choice of way of cooking such as sezchuan, Korean, veggie stir fry or Chinese to make up your bento box.  They serve sushi too if you are into that.You make your order with the cashier and they will you a number for your table and they ll bring out the food out to you.  I went with my girl friends so we got one number.  I ordered tofu sezchuan and that was tasty.  It's not as spicy as the authentic sezchuan dishes but it was savory.  The portions are huge and it's pretty filling for dinner.  We got all that for roughly $12.00 per bento box.  I definitely will be back to try other dishes."
11/2/2020,1,"This place is trash, waited 35 minutes to get my food while I watched 2 people come in after me and Get thier orders which had sushi in them. (Not to mention like 14 take out orders) When I asked what was going on the girl told me that they were waiting on a 4 piece spicy tuna roll for my order.... this is some bad service and organization to forget my order and make me wait! I missed out on the sunset waiting for this while people who came later got much bigger orders! I regret tipping, PS this was 530 on a Monday night. Wasted my sunset for old food u can put together in a second. I'll put a picture of the 35 minute sushi 4 piece I had 1 of..."
3/13/2022,4,I really like going here but the service is bad. Which is really annoying because the food is good. Been here a bunch of time and every time my wife and I eat here our food never comes out together. I don't understand how a noodle bowl and sushi come out before a poke bowl with just chicken (that's cold).
7/19/2021,1,"Ledy: you are an horrible Yelp responser . Ask people to send emails and never respond, very bad practices. Since you are not the owner, so it is probably not your fault. But still, time to find another job, where you are appreciated."
9/11/2020,4,"Bento has always been my go-to when I'm craving fast and consistently delicious Asian food! This location always tends to be busy and I like to order ahead online to avoid waiting in line forever. They happened to have a promotion where you can get a free mini poké bowl with a $25 online order and I took advantage of it last night bc my sister loves poké bowls! I ordered two chicken katsu bento boxes with red curry (10/10) for my bf and I, a special Mexican roll (5/10 - the rice was way too mushy) and a teriyaki chicken bento box (9/10) for my sister. For the poké bowl, she customized it & got salmon, mixed greens, cucumbers, avocado, wakame, cream cheese, & jalapeño & scallion with ginger dressing (8/10). All in all, would totally recommend if you're in the mood for fast Asian food that never disappoints!"
12/5/2019,4,"The food is delicious!!! My faves/go-to menu items include:-Spicy Yellowtail-Spicy Tuna-Mex Roll-Beef/Steak Mongolian Rice Bowl-Pork Dumplings-Thai TeaThe only thing that deters it from a 5 star is the wait. It's ALWAYS BUSY at this location. If you're hangry, have a small snack before coming in. Also, I can't even get the delivery option from here anymore!"
9/16/2019,2,"So this place is pretty terrible. I only went here because I received a coupon for $3.50 off of a chicken bowl... bringing it to five dollars for the bowl. A pretty good deal until you factor in the food...I had to get a refund on my soda, because the drink was out of about 2/3 of the sodas. The picture looks good, but this is a bowl of plain rice, with what appears to be microwaved frozen broccoli, and some nasty chicken. I can only assume that they soaked the chicken in a soy sauce marinade overnight and then boiled it the next day, Although I think they called it grilled teriyaki. It came with a cup of teriyaki sauce which I quickly poured all over the chicken, but it really added nothing but moisture.I have no idea why this place is so popular, it was quite crowded at lunchtime. Pei Wei is just down the road and infinitely better"
10/5/2019,5,"Loved the Bento Box! I had the Garlic Broccoli with Chicken box, very delicious! It comes with Chicken, garlic flavored broccoli, white or brown rice, ginger salad and string beans (see photo).Very friendly service and clean restaurant.They are busy at lunch, but the wait was not too bad. You can pre-order to skip the line and save time."
9/27/2020,5,"My husband & I have ordered twice from Bento. Each time, the food was delicious, perfect temp, and ample. I ordered the ahi poke tuna bowl, hubby ordered General Tso's chicken. Sooooooooo good!!!"
6/23/2019,2,Today we stopped in for our favorite Japanese curry bento box and rice bowl - and were extremely disappointed! The curry was watery & liquid. It was not the curry sauce that we usually are used too. It left a watery soggy mess in my bento box. I didn't order a curry soup! Very disappointing experience today. Something went wrong in the kitchen!
11/29/2020,3,So i have been withokding my review on this place for a month now because i assumed it was a freak mishap... but today they messed up for the third time. This review is for today... first off the place isnt packed. Yet for some magical reason they messed up my order. They complemented me with another soup as a apology... however while i accept this apology... i kinda expected the following.... slow service rude staff poor covid19 control. To simplify my review... food good... service and accuracy of taking order is complete poop.
1/24/2021,5,"Bento has been my favorite sushi joint for years. From their bento boxes, to their sushi, to their bowls, I've never had a dish I dislike. Everything is so fresh and they have a variety of sauces to choose from. The TNT Roll and Volcano Roll are my favorites, and you can't miss out on the Spicy Cream (Pao Pao) chicken noodle bowl! You cannot go wrong with ordering from Bento so try this place out! (And please expand up north ASAP!!!)"
12/28/2021,2,"I like the Sushi from here, but when I order on Uber Eats, they quote one time for delivery and it keeps changing! Allot of the time waiting 2 hrs for the food! Reason why? They pick up 2-4 orders and mine is usually last to be delivered! Bad customer service. Vendor blames it on Uber Eats. Wake up and complain to them!"
9/24/2020,5,What a delicious treat! Ordered through DoorDash and was so excited to receive my meals. Everything was so tasty.Definitely ordering again!
5/17/2017,4,"I frequent the Bento located in downtown Orlando quite often so I one day I decided to try the East Orlando location. The selection of food is good; however, I always order the Spicy Cream Chicken Bento Box. Don't let the name fool you, it's not spicy. Per my usual, I substituted the dessert for additional rice (you can also do noodles). Their bento boxes come with a good amount of food, even for those growing boys. This particular Bento has open seating all day. Both times I have been to this location the seating is selective because there are multiple tables with dirty dishes that have not been grabbed. Also, keep in mind that this place is hopping on a Saturday night. You will have to wait in line to order. Food - AService - COverall I always have a delightful meal when I go to Bento."
11/18/2020,1,"I understand charging extra for sauce so people don't take advantage but $0.50 for one extra tiny sauce is outrageous. Just two little cause cups is $1 on top of me already spending money for a bowl that doesn't come with enough sauce to begin with. On top of this, I had to pick through my salad because it has some brown lettuce."
8/21/2021,1,I try to always go to the winter park location which is so much better but today we were in the area of the UCF location. I ordered my food at 4pm and they said my order would be ready at 4:20. I showed up at 4:45 and was told that my food still was not ready! This Bento should get an award for always taking forever to make your order regardless of how busy they are.
5/23/2017,5,"Came here with my daughter in hopes it was as good as the downtown location. No disappointment at all. I had this salad bowl with Salmon and added some veggies. I can't describe it much more than it had this spicy mayo, lettuce which was very fresh, seaweed salad, tomato and added a little eel sauce. It was heavenly. Order at the front, take a number and have a seat."
7/21/2019,4,Check the menu and many choices.Been here twice and not bad. Close to home. Very filling if you are hungry.
11/12/2019,3,"I ordered the pineapple chicken bowl, sushi, and a miso soup. The pineapple chicken bowl was good and tasted fresh. I was not a huge fan of the sushi and ended up only eating a few of the rolls. I found the seaweed was rather chewy and there wasn't much flavor in the sushi. The staff was very friendly and accommodating when I asked if I could add on a soup quickly to my order, after we had already checked out. The miso soup was pretty good, far better than the sushi. I am NOT a fan of the size of the soft drink cups. I hate having to constantly have my drink refilled because the cup is so small. Overall good experience but not necessarily my new go-to place."
4/10/2019,5,"Casual, simple, good comfort-foods, and fast service!? Yes. I love Bento's! Whenever I am craving Asian foods but do not feel like driving far out, I would always go to Bento by default. Why not..! The foods are awesome, taste amazing, and the services (Sand Lake and UCF location) are outstanding! The environment/atmosphere here is perfect for group gathering and social event, even for kids. Casual date night is okay too. During lunch hour and weekend nights, especially the one located nearby UCF, the restaurant can gets really busy so come accordingly. If you do not want to wait in line or to dine in, you can pre-order online and come during pick up. I always do that since I get to skip the line and since I do not have a high level of patience. What about the foods? Adequate amount, reasonable price, nice presentation, look appealing, flavorful, full-filling. One of the reasons why I prefer Bento is because they provided good ""to-go"" foods that is suitable for lunch or dinner while presenting a classy look in term of platting. Majority of the time I would always order Sriracha Garlic bento box, with options of shrimp, tofu, or chicken as the main source protein, wok-stir fried with white onion, green bell peppers, and red bell peppers. (I usually get tofu or chicken since eating shrimp will only raise my LDL level to the roof even more. The box comes with a side portion of the house salad (sweet ginger dressing), white Jasmine rice, stir fry noodle, green beans, and fried wonton strip with condensed milk for desert. I preferred the box over the bowl option since the foods are kept separated. To me, the Sriracha Garlic is the best flavor out there, which is not too salty, not too spicy, not too sweet. The chicken or tofu go really well with the plain white white where the flavor balances each other out. Occasionally, I would get the Spicy Bulgogi (marinated sliced beef with lots of onions and scallion); Mongolian (red bell pepper, onion, scallion, mushroom, sweet hoisin sauce); Sesame Soy (red bell pepper, snow peas, zucchini, onion, sweet soy); and Korean (red bell pepper, onion, scallion, gochujang sauce). All of the one listed here are my to-go-to when I am tired of the Sriracha Garlic. My brother's persoanl favorite is the Mongolian, but not really mine since ti has mushroom. I have never tried their Pineapple Thai Fried Rice but I will next time since a lot of my friends has high praises. If you do not feel like eating rice box or rice box, then get yourself some rice rolls (SUSHI)! Dynamite, Spicy Salmon, Salmon Volcano. They are not necessary the best sushi in Orlando but it is good enough, especially when one is hangry. Overall, all my experience and visit here are great. Nothing to complain about. I enjoy the food and the people, where both are good and friendly, and that is enough for me. I do not have expectations or standard when it comes to a restaurant joint as such."
1/12/2017,4,"Bento's has always impressed me with their overall consistency in terms of quality and preparation. Whether it's in Gainesville or Orlando, you know you're going to get a decent meal at a fair price. My go to dish at Bento's is the Spicy Cream Shrimp Rice Bowl. Batons of fried tempura shrimp tossed in a delightfully spicy and creamy sauce goes perfectly with the rice and string beans that come with your meal. You would think that being so heavily coated in sauce, the fried tempura shrimp would become soggy and unappealing. However that is the furthest from the truth. The shrimp manages to maintain the wonderfully crunchy exterior while protecting the well cooked shrimp on the inside. That crunch and sauce make for the perfect combination of taste and texture in my opinion.One thing about this location, heavy traffic means it is always a fight for an optimal parking spot. So be prepared for some quick hustling if you want a prime spot. But overall, good spot for a quick and delicious meal."
3/15/2019,4,"I've been coming to Bento for a couple of years now because it's close to our office and a good lunch option. Bento is one of those restaurants I never think of going to but leave satisfied every time I go. I went today for lunch and was so happy with my food and service, I finally decided to leave a review.We sat at the bar (good thing, the line to order was out the door) and were greeted by the sweetest server. She was obviously swamped with all of the to-go orders and people ordering but she greeted us with a smile and served us waters and took down any appetizer orders. I was starving today so I ordered the spring rolls for the first time here. We also ordered the crab wontons which were delicious as usual. After a couple of minutes with our menu, our server took our order quickly and I settled on the shrimp tempura rice bowl. She took the time to explain that it's only shrimp tempura with a little bit of green beans over a bed of brown rice, to make sure I wasn't expecting anything else! Everyone else ordered either rice or noodle bowls and a poke bowl. My spring rolls came out quickly and were warm, crispy, and tasty. The sweet sauce on the side they were paired with was delicious - tangy and just the right amount of sweet. My rice bowl also came out fairly quickly and was just as the server described. There was a good amount of shrimp tempura pieces and a small serving of green beans on the side. The green beans were absolutely delicious and I quickly ate those up. I saved my spring rolls sauce and ate the shrimp tempura with that. The shrimp were big and juicy and fried perfectly in the tempura flakes!One of the girls I was with ordered a rice bowl and found some hair on the top as soon as it was set down. The runner who brought the food could not be more apologetic and had the kitchen make her a new dish. He comped her meal, too!Overall, today was the best experience I've had at Bento and writing about it makes my mouth water for more shrimp tempura. I think if this was the only dish I'd ever gotten there this would easily be a 5 star review!"
2/15/2021,1,Placed a order for 2  bowls I was asked for the sauce told them white sauce they said 3 will be fine I said yes so I wait for the order to ready and when they hand it to me there was 2 sauce I told the lady was supposed to get 3 sauce she says u get 2 only and any extra will be .50 cents which is not a big deal even though I was told will get 3 sauce any way I pull out a dollar to pay for the sauce and she is like we don't accept cash sorry so now I am not going to charge my cc for .50 cents so I just leave and not to mention she was the manager of the place seeing I wanted to pay for the sauce I would expect her to just give it to me but no And not the mention when I ordered the food I tipped them too which I regret
5/5/2016,4,"Even tho this place is called Bentos, their bentos are alright. Not bad for the price but their veggies comes with it are alright. The noodles are alright, if you want noodles, just the noodle dish instead. There are good days that the veggies good. Their Katsu with or without curry, all the curries, spicy cream, ramen, and their sushi don are good. I tried some of their sushi rolls but can't remember which ones now but they are good. Curries have a nice strong flavor and they give Katsu is good portion to you. Spicy cream is actually interesting sauce that I don't know any other places does this sauce. If you want their rice or noodles, get spicy cream! Their beef udon soup is actually not that bad. I couldn't stop drinking the soup! Their now ramen got better. They have changed it since few months ago. But they only do limited ramens per day so ask if they still have it.Their Korean beef and hibachi dishes are alright. I would have just gone to Korean restaurant for Korean beef. Their boba is alright. They do do boba stamps. Get 8 stamps, get 9th one free. They have poke bowl now for $9.50! Not bad price! I haven't try it but my friend said its alright. I'll give it a try anyways next time!"
1/18/2019,4,"I've been going to Bento at its original location in Gainesville since I first started college. Upon moving to Orlando, I was really happy to see there was a Bento that reminded me of home at UF. This location is very clean and modern. Staff is friendly and service is quick. There are tons of options to choose from the menu. The classic favorite is spicy cream chicken (now called Pao Pao Chicken?). I've also had their udon noodle bowl with katsu chicken and orange chicken. Their bento boxes are also great as well. All of their food honestly does the job when it comes to craving Asian food that isn't your average Chinese takeout. My favorite that I usually always get here is their tuna salmon don. The bowl itself is delicious and they always have A+ presentation when it comes to their bowls. I love how they cut up their cream cheese into little cubes so it's easier to eat rather than one big clump! LOL. Overall, Bento is so conveniently across from UCF campus and the food is great. Will continue to come back and try new dishes."
8/1/2018,2,"Food was okay. I was in the mood for a poke bowl so decided to come here before work. The thing that ticked me off about this place was that we had to wait 10 minutes to put in our order. There was only one person taking orders at the register while 6 employees were in the back conversing. They could be talking about work for all i know, but to customers, that looks bad. They need to work on making sure customers are taken care of in a timely manner. If people wait too long in line to get their food, they will be more inclined to leave to get something somewhere else. Another thing that was annoying was that the employee charged me an extra sushi bowl. They took 5 minutes to void the transaction, but gave me no voided receipt. They also charged me again for the same order, so there's a possibility I got charged double. With all the trouble, they did nothing to help, but say sorry. Hopefully you don't experience this if you come here like I did."
4/13/2018,3,"Look, the place is good. Good food, good portion good price. I wouldn't qualify this place as amazing though. I've been here a few times and every time I get annoyed at 2 things.Please clean the tables more often. Every table is usually messy or hasn't been bussed when I'm at this location.If there is more than one order per table, maybe time the food so that they arrive at a similar time, not a drastic 10-15 minute difference. Otherwise I quite like the place."
2/22/2021,1,This would be a 4 star if the lady didn't yell at us for asking for a TOGO bowl. Not only did we get yelled at for the bowl but then later on we preceded to ask for a bag and we got yelled at again. I think her name was Karen. Not sure what the issue was for asking for these things but rest of the people were nice.
1/12/2021,1,Been coming here for 2 years might be the last time.  Terrible service terrible food took forever to het our food one bowl came out finally the rice was ice cold then finally the bento box comes out wrong chicken then what I ordered the veggies were mush pic attached & there might have been 3-4 pieces of chicken. Staff had no concern at all
1/24/2020,2,"Normally an okay meal/sushi at this bentos. Couple times they've changed things. They no longer make the rice free rolls which we got every time. But last night we went with our family and ordered the same thing we always get. Large bowl, $14, and there's an add protein portion at the bottom for $3 dollars. But the women at the counter argued with me we couldn't add extra chicken to our bowl with that. That it was only for a certain item. Yet on the menu it doesn't say anything about that. It simply says add protein $3.  Which we have done before. She got rude with me and my family and wouldn't get a manager when I asked to speak to someone. Last but not least my daughter (3 years old) got her food last. And not just a minute or two, like 15 minutes after everyone else. Which I'm sure you can see a problem with that."
11/22/2020,3,Not so much a fan. The meat is very chewy. The sauces taste store bought. Definitely closer to a frozen dish than anything fresh.
2/10/2019,5,"This place is phenomenal. I love the staff, the atmosphere, the food is fresh. Parking is somewhat limited, but there's a parking garage right next to the establishment that is free. The place is clean and the food is affordable. Highly recommend for your quick stop for sushi."
7/17/2020,2,In today's ever changing COVID world some businesses have been successful in adapting and overcoming challenges. Bento has failed in doing so. Ordered our food ahead and still waiting. Clearly they need to work on how food is ordered and picked up. We will not return.
7/13/2019,3,"Been going to the Dr Phillips location for years. This was my second visit to this location, across from UCF. Unfortunately, much the same as my first visit, my food and experience lacked. Poké bowlwas tuna and eel - the eel was overcooked. Again. And my bowl came six minutes after the cooked bowl in my party. (After four other tables, that ordered AFTER us, received their orders.) The cooked bowl had shrimp and was too salty. Part of her rice was hard, either burned or old. Props to the girl at the register- she was patient with my mother's questions and very helpful & knowledgeable with recommendations."
7/15/2020,5,Coral the manager was so sweet and accommodating. There was an issue with my order and she was so quick to make things right and rectify the situation. Great customer service from her!
5/9/2020,4,"Great menu for sushi, Thai, Chinese, and Japanese food. Quick order at the counter and sit down style restaurant. More of a casual college stylepplace."
4/21/2019,4,"Get the Spicy Cream Chicken with White Rice. It's to die for. (they renamed it ""Pao Pao chicken"" but that just sounds weird to me)Service is typically good though it can take a while sometimes. Since it's located right across the street from UCF in a busy Plaza, lines are consistently long. Which is why you should ALWAYS ORDER AT THE BAR! There's a register there too and they can take your order there instead and skip the line. The food itself is pretty good but it's your run-of-the-mill Asian/fusion restaurant. Nothing particularly special but it's consistently good!"
9/2/2018,4,"Great Boba Teas and friendly service, just not prompt whenever we visit. We're looking forward to dining-in soon as it has been awhile.The entrees as well as appetizers are scrumptious, just not always hot due to sitting on counter for lengthy time prior to being served."
9/2/2017,4,"Bento Cafe is a restaurant chain that offers a variety of Asian dishes. You'll find flavors from Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Japan... you can have a new experience during every meal. This was not my first time eating at a Bento cafe but it was my first time at this particular location. The restaurant was clean, staff were nice, and food was good. We ordered a variety of dishes for the people in my party and we all tried each others to see what was good. A person I dine with is obsessed with Asian food so I find myself eating these flavors often even though it's one of my least favorites, but the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup will be my go-to menu item here. I do wish it had more bok choy in it - gotta get your veggies! but it was perfectly spiced (if not a little salty), nourishing, carb comforting with long udon noodles, and surprisingly hardy with huge chunks of beef that you barely had to chew. If I have to eat Asian, Bento cafe would be one of the restaurants I wouldn't mind repeating. Tip: You can request brown rice instead of white rice if desired."
6/23/2017,5,"One of my favorite places to get Asian food in the Orlando area. Service is quick, location is great (right by UCF) campus, and the food is fantastic. Bento offers a variety of Asian inspired food items on their menu, everything from Korean pork, sushi, Sweet and sour chicken, as well as a wide range of different boba teas. I've tried almost every item on the menu and now I just usually get the sweet and sour chicken bento box or udon noodle bowl. Food is always served quick with the exception of maybe Friday and Saturday nights where this place is jammed packed. It makes a great lunch spot during the day though, I would go often back in the day when I was close by. Overall, Bento can be highly recommended whether you have a craving for Asian inspired dishes or just want to pick up some boba tea. Can't go wrong with stopping here. They also have a small selection of beers should you be in the mood."
9/30/2017,5,"Bento Cafe is a dream come true. Quick service, delicious food, and the nicest staff ever! I've been to all three locations in Orlando and all of them have surpass my expectations over and over. The UCF location is quick service. Once you have decided what you want from one of the menus conveniently located at the front, you proceed to the register to order where you'll be given a number for your meal. After paying, you can proceed to sit wherever you want and the food will be brought out to you in a very timely manner! Location is very spacious, there's plenty of seating inside and outside which is nice for individuals that want to sit outside and enjoy the weather. But let's talk about the most important topic of all which is the FOOD. Bento offers a variety of food ranging from bento boxes, rice bowls, noodle bowls, sushi, and boba tea. There's something for everyone. No foodie gets left behind! The food is always hot, good portions, and comes out relatively fast when you take into consideration how much traffic goes through here. My favorite would have to the Spicy Cream chicken or shrimp rice bowl, curry katsu, kawaii roll, build - a - poke, chirashi and so much more. You def can't miss out on the variety of sauces from the ponzu, spicy mayo, white sauce, and eel sauce either. Everything is extremely filling. Go to Bento! You won't be disappointed."
5/23/2015,3,"Bento's has opened their second location at this location near by UCF a few months ago and it is pretty busy all the time. The interior is contemporary looking with a small bar to the left, sushi bar in the back, and the rest of the open restaurant. There is open seating but some of the tables are awkwardly situated that doesn't allow a good flow because they are so close to each other. The entrance funnels customer to order at the station before they are given a number to be placed at the table. I am pretty sure the menu is the same as the location in downtown. I don't know why but i always order dishes that resemble Chinese food (way of life...habit.. i don't know?!)  and it's alrriiiight. I've gotten a cantonese pork chop bento box and also szechuan chicken over rice. They were both mediocre and tasted lack seasoning. The cantonese pork chop is especially dry when cooked the way they served (seared). If they do make the sauces they might need to tweak it a bit besides having everything taste like soy sauce.Surprisingly, their katsu dishes (fried pork chop) is much better and tender. I would also say their curry sauces are pretty good too whether it is home made or coming from a jar. It's a great place for lunch because it's quick for the most part. There was an instance where the meal took literally 25 minutes to make where all the other people around was getting their food. However, the manager graciously offered a 10 dollar GC to covered the meal."
2/10/2017,3,"I came here after a friend invited me to dinner. When you first come in you order at the register, they give you a number, you sit, and they bring you the food. The selection of food is good and I opted for the build you own bowl and a miso soup.   My bowl consisted of shrimp, tuna, salmon, seaweed, shitakii mushrooms, avocado, and carrots. It was okay, nothing out of this world. I really likedl the mushrooms but I think they had sugar in them. One of my concerns was that I had a few questions and the girl taking my order just kept saying I don't know which I don't blame her. If their staff is not trained on the menu then they wouldn't know the answers. Also, I didn't expect her to leave her register and ask, especially since there was a line.    Also, the amount of avocado was next to nothing and that was dissapointing. I really liked the broth in the miso soup, probably the best thing I ate there. The atmosphere is loud, very social. So if your coming here for some nice quiet time with conversation then go somewhere else. I didn't really mind it. Overall, an okay place but forgettable compare to other Japanese restaurants."
9/27/2018,4,"Every time I come in, I am so impressed by the quick service, large portions and high quality of the food!I'll admit that the rice bowls can be a bit plain, as they only come with rice, string beans and whatever protein you choose. While the proteins are covered in a sauce already, my boyfriend ended up stealing some of the seaweed salad from MY bowl as he felt that his chicken katsu was lacking more flavor. But he still enjoyed his meal- the cuts were so juicy and tender, while the bread crumbs were crisp! I also really enjoyed my meal. The Surf'n'Turf with chicken teriyaki and extra white sauce is soo filling and yummy! In the end, I'm so happy this restaurant is located so near to the UCF campus and Special shoutout to Norynne who greeted us cheerfully in the line :)"
5/18/2019,5,"Been here a few times and I like this location as it's easy to find free parking (there's a parking garage at the back). The line to get your order is fast and you can look at the menu while waiting to decide what to get. They have a wide variety of food from bento boxes, sushi, and poke bowl. They have some nice craft beers as well. It's self service (think fast food but healthier and delicious options) and you can ask for water cup when ordering. I got the mini poke bowl and 4 piece rainbow sushi this time as I wasn't too hungry. But the portion of mini salmon poke bowl was larger than I expected and in a good portion as well. Ingredients were fresh and yummy. If you don't like poke bowl or sushi, I would suggest the Japanese curry in bowl or get the teriyaki Bento (salmon or chicken) box is really delicious and I usually have to take it to go as the portions are generous. They also have to go boxes ready so it's really self help and fast to eat and go if you are in a hurry. If not, stay around the nice booth or just chill at the sport bars craft beer section for a good chat with friends or date night! Worth a visit to this branch!"
6/7/2017,5,"When me and a friend said we were in the mood for sushi rolls another one of our friend, swore by this place and boy, she did not disappoint!Walking in, I noticed that this place was very much a hot spot! Lines were to the door but it moved pretty fast. My friend who is known for her taste buds, did all the ordering, so we grab some singha beers and a table. Moments later, plates of delicious rolls and rolls were placed in front of us! We dived in immediately. We started off with the lava roll. It was the bomb dot com. We ended up ordering 2 more rounds of it. After that we got Mexican rolls, fried pork dumplings and a curry chicken katsu. All which were really good but I was hooked on those lava rolls.This location is really clean and the staff are all friendly. Service was great, food was on point and we had a wonderful time."
4/27/2020,5,Decided to try and ordered delivery. Wow! This place has the most DELICIOUS asian food I have ever had. This restaurant is not your typical Chinese take out. It's an amazingly good restaurant with great food. I really enjoyed General Tso chicken and my significant other tried the Teriyaki chicken and was amazed how good it was. I will order from here if I ever have a taste for Asian food.
4/13/2020,1,"My roommate ordered a Poke Bowl for pickup through Door Dash, and then proceeded to go to the store after 10 minutes, she was told ""it's not ready yet"". Waited an hour in the car only to go inside and be told they didn't get it yet. Then her boyfriend get in and suddenly they had the order and it ""had been ready for a while"""
2/17/2017,4,"I really dig Bento and while the one downtown is closer to my home, this one is perfect when I'm at work at UCF. As a vegan I appreciate the tofu option for their rice bowls and I'm starting to be more adventurous as far as trying different dishes.I normally get the broccoli rice bowl with tofu, so I mixed it up with the sweet and sour bowl with tofu this time and I'm glad I did! It's really good and a great balance of flavors. The tofu is done well, it's not soggy like you can sometimes get at places that don't drain the tofu properly.Their spring role appetizer sometimes is iffy on flavor and how thoroughly cooked it is, and I know they've mixed up my order once in the past. But I will continue to come back often to try the different bowls because it's worth it and so convenient. They even let you call ahead!"
5/9/2019,3,"This place actually does have decent food. The service is pretty okay as far as that goes. I come here for a quick bite, generally takes about 10-15 min for all food to come out (no longer than that). A lot of college kids come in and they have a bar and its got great specials (always packed on those nights i dont drink but assume its good). I have tried the chicken teriyaki and i have tried the beef bolgolgi. I think next time i may try the sushi though. Also, the Miso is excellent."
8/15/2020,1,Lost my online order! Had to wait 20+ minutes for them to cook it when I got there to pick it up! First and last time I'll be coming here!
1/21/2019,4,"If you're a college student on a budget but crave quality food, Bento will be your go-to. When I was a student at UCF I came here at least once a week. I like getting the build your own poke bowls and their other dishes as well. Today, I got their Szechuan Beef Noodle soup for this cold weather, and man did it really hit the spot. Must try! But it is a lil spicy so beware!"
7/29/2018,5,"I love BENTO Cafe !!!! I always go for the Pai Thai with Chicken It has a little kick in it that makes you want more and more. And the noodles are rice noodles and always comes out delicious  My girlfriend got a lo mien With steak  it was amazing as well. We been to bentos many times and multiple reason. But usually whenever we want something Chinese related we head over there.And the sushi are amazing. I would recommend for people that aren't sushi fans like myself. To order the ""Crunch"" (Raw) or ""Hot Lava""(Cooked) both great with Spicy Mayo on the side!!! Yummy !!!"
1/7/2019,4,"I have to say I really like Bento. Fresh food and consistent quality. The biggest drawback is the noise level and huge lines during lunch time.Bento is one of the options near my work and I do love their make your own poke bowl. Not like Hawaiian poke but close enough and it gets me that fix of yummy raw fish. For the poke bowls you choose your base white rice, brown rice or mixed greens (half brown rice and half mixed greens is my fave). Then choose one, two or three proteins (from raw to cooked options). Choose up to 4 veggies, two toppings and two sauces. They also offer sushi, bento boxes and so much more. Definitely on of the better chain restaurant options around East Orlando/UCF area."
2/1/2019,5,"Stopped by for dinner after we heard they were a title sponsor for a fundraising dance.  The concept is clean and well laid out.  We got in line to order and it moved fast.  We had sushi, a garlic chicken rice bowl, ramen special, bubble tea, beer, and some edamame .  When we ordered and we were told it would be about 15 mins for our food.  It was even faster and everything was fresh.  The food came out individually and was great.  Everyone loved their meal and the quick service and friendly staff."
9/9/2017,5,"Bento is my go-to whenever I'm in the UCF area and need a quick bite! I've also been to their downtown location multiple times. It's a fast casual spot so the service is quick. This location is right across from the McDonald's. Order at the front, they give you a number to be seated anywhere you want, and they'll bring the food to you. The location is large and I've never had an issue finding seating.They offer a variety of menu items such as sushi, noodle and rice bowls, bento boxes, and bubble tea. There is something for everyone to choose from. The food is great for the portion, price, and convenience (most items are under $12). Food is always consistent every time I go. My favorite items are their Spicy Cream chicken bento box and their Chirashi bowl. Very filling!"
5/25/2019,4,"Came here today with my siblings and cousins for a quick lunch. It's a casual place and lucky for us, the line was short. The service was also quick. I tried the Japanese Curry katsu. It comes with a complimentary sauce so I had the white sauce. The curry sauce tasted delightful, but the white sauce was amazing. The katsu was crispy and moist. Also had the Pao Pao spicy cream with chicken and tofu. The portions were huge and the spicy cream sauce was delicious! Prices were reasonable and food was great!"
3/10/2019,4,Tried Bento Box tonight with my sister. She really likes it so I was excited to try it. We walked in and I was pleasantly surprised with the simple decor and aroma. I had several questions about the menu. The young lady taking our orders answered them for me. I think this place is ok. If I want sushi... I'll go to my favorite place. But it wasn't bad and the atmosphere was friendly.
8/28/2017,5,"My gf is a teacher so the first couple of weeks are usually pretty stressful for her. That usually means a lot of errands after work and a lot of eating out which I fully take advantage of. Today she asked me to drive to the UCF Amazon store so I decided to take advantage and head to bento for dinner. I've been to the one downtown multiple times and it's one of my favorite Asian spots. I have never been to this location before.For starters the UCF location is counter service. You order at the register, they give you a number and bring the food to the table. Drinks are self serve. As an appetizer we ordered the Mexican roll (8 pieces). It came very quick and was delivered with some eel sauce. It was delicious. You can tell the tempura shrimp was just made because as soon as the roll hits your mouth you can taste the warm delicious flavor of tempura. Add a little eel sauce and BAM, you get the perfect roll. As an entree I ordered the spicy cream chicken after reading so many good things online. Boy o Boy was it the right choice. The chicken was delicious and had the perfect amount of sweet and spice. It was almost like a spicy mayo type of sauce that was cooked on the kitchen. Everyone who reads my reviews knows I love crispy chicken and sweet and spicy flavors so this plate was my perfect combination. The bento box came with rice, noodles, dessert, and a salad. Next time I might order the rice bowl since the amount you get in the bento mix isn't very filings. My gf ordered the Siracha garlic chicken bento box. This was also very tasty as well. It was a lot spicier than my chicken and seemed to be a lot heavier in flavors. Overall I loved bento at UCF. I wish it was more like he sit down service downtown but everything was great. Any time I am in the mood for Asian I will pick this place."
7/26/2019,5,Came in here for some lunch. I ordered the combo which had some really good rolls. Especially loved the Cali roll.
7/10/2019,5,"We had this last night for take out as we wanted something more healthy and substantial than we had been eating while on vacation; my husband had the udon vegetable stir fry bowl with tofu, and I had the sesame bento box with tofu.  Both were excellent, fresh, and the sauces were very flavorful. The tofu was prepared well, all of the entrees looked appetizing, and the vegetables were not over cooked. Only one minor issue--the lettuce in the salads was a little wilted. We will definitely be returning for either an eat-in or a take-out again."
7/21/2016,4,"I've been to Bento Cafe several times since it's conveniently near my workplace in the UCF area. When ordering at the counter, make sure you grab either the sushi menu or hot food menu (they call it Asian Kitchen) - or double fist it if you're hungry! I've tried various items over multiple visits. Food has met my expectations and has been consistently good. My favorites are the Florida roll and Szechuan chicken rice bowl. Recently I noticed they've limited orders to one sauce. I typically only need one sauce anyway, so it doesn't bother me, but it makes me wonder if there were hungry college students consuming large quantities of sauces at some point... Either way, four stars for this Asian restaurant chain!"
2/16/2021,1,"The lamest excuse for Asian food ever. The sauces are sugary or taste like water. I'd rather get less food and have it be higher quality. Bento is quite frankly, shitty and disappointing every time I go."
4/9/2019,5,"Classic! @eatatbento is where it's at! Right by #ucf ! It's just around $11 for 3 different types of sushi rolls, salad and yummy broccoli! Oh! Don't forget to ask for the white sauce!  It's definitely worth the bite!"
2/28/2020,1,Ordered food & 5 mins later it arrived to table COLD. Girl at front register misinformed us of the options and menu. Waitress snatched plate without asking if we were done.  ONE & DONE!!! NEVER WILL I EAT HERE AGAIN! I don't advise you too either. I also ordered the sushi that was so sticky that it stuck hard to the plate! I'd advise going to a real bento or Asian spot instead of here with struggling students n cooks.
9/14/2016,3,"There is only one thing about Bento Cafe that I cannot stand -- they do not deliver all food ordered by the same table at the same time. Every single time we came here, the first person at our table will finish his/her meal before the next person is served.We ordered a deluxe Sushi, a Special Sushi roll, a shrimp Pad Thai and a Chicken Wok with Noodles. Everything was great, except for the Chicken Wok is a bit heavy on the salt. Convenient for UCF parents and sons to meet."
1/12/2017,4,"This Bentos like many of the other locations around Florida serves up your favorite Asian American dishes including the likes of spicy cream, curry katsu, sweet and sour etc.I tend to order the Chicken curry katsu or the spicy cream chicken, both are pretty much staples for me every time I go to Bentos. The food here comes out pretty quick, faster than the Gainesville locations in my opinion. I also feel like they do a better job with the chicken curry Katsu here, its just more crisp and better tasting. I've also had the crab/cheese rangoons which arnt bad. You also have the option of going noodle, rice, or bentos box with each entree. Personally I like going rice bowl cause I find it more filling and just a better complement to the entrees I order.This location is a decent size with plenty of seating, theres also a parking garage if you cant find any parking space in the lot. Overall, Bentos is a place I'll crave every now and then. I never seem to get tired of it. It's a solid choice for Asian American and close to UCF campus as well."
10/9/2019,5,"I really love this Bento's and I'm glad that my coworkers introduced me to them. I haven't been able to find any great Yaki Udon here in Orlando, and Bento's sure can cook Yaki Udon very well. They first time I tried it, I did Teriyaki chicken Yaki Udon with their white sauce, and the second time, I ordered the garlic shrimp Yaki Udon. I also tried their Passionfruit green tea and, though quite pricey, it was very smooth and not too sweet. Both times I ordered to go and I did not have to wait too long to get my food and I received great customer service, even though they were very busy both times I came. Will definitely come back"
6/4/2018,5,"When I come to Bento I always have to get the Spicy Cream Tofu Udon Noodle Bowl, it is literally my guilty pleasure even though it is so simple it is bursting with flavor. I wish I had a picture to show the beauty but every time I get it I always eat it so quickly before I remember to take a picture. You can get it on a rice bowl or noodle bowl (udon, mini udon, or lo mein) and then choose either chicken or tofu. For greens there will be green beans on the side. Bento isn't the most authentic Asian food, but for being so close to UCF and for college students to get a quick Asian cuisine, this will do. They have a variety of flavors you can choose from to be on a rice bowl or noodle bowl as well as bento boxes. Pro tip: If you check in with Facebook they will give you $1 off"
9/16/2018,5,Fast food Asian fusion cafe.  A lot of tasty options here to choose from depending on what you are in the mood for.  The service is pretty quick and out of all the times I have been I have yet to been disappointed with anything I have gotten.  Great option for Asian food on the go just Incase for whenever ur tired of normal Chinese takeout.
3/29/2020,1,I waited probably 30 minutes for ONE order of Katsu Curry. I grew mildly impatient watching the employees lolly gag and take their time with everything and everyone. In the midst of the Corona Virus there were more than 20 people in the lobby with no protective equipment or strategy implemented. NEVER going back to this disappointing restaurant
1/30/2018,4,"Was craving the spicy cream chicken, so came to this location since it was closer than the one downtown.  At this one, you stand in line, order, then are given a number to place on your table until your food is brought out.  We went around 3:30 pm on a Sunday not expecting it to be too busy, but it was.  The line didn't take too long and we were able to find a booth by the drink machine.  There was a bit of a wait before we got our food, about 20 mins, but when we got it, we did enjoy it.  My boyfriend and I both got the spicy cream chicken bento box that comes with ginger salad, string beans, noddles, white rice, and the amazing spicy cream chicken.  It is so good you will definitely want to come back for more!"
3/19/2018,5,"Love the concept, the food and wish there was one in Tampa. Food is fresh and done just right. Very tasty Bento Box with spicy cream over tofu. It was fried, but very delicious. Will definitely be back"
3/10/2019,3,"Large variety of Rolls and combinations, and you can get a decent meal for about 10$. However if you're not a fan of loud places you might not like how busy it is. That being said, its well lit and decently fast service."
1/4/2020,5,"I just want to state that my boyfriend is one of the pickiest eaters ever and this place manage to have him try new things ever time we go here! We come here almost every week now because everything is so good! I wish i could give this place more than just a 5 stars. I really enjoy every meal that was given to us so far and I especially love the sushi bento box! It is absolutely one of my favorites! Here is a recent picture of one of our orders we got! Beside the yummy food, all the employees are very nice! There was this one time I was waiting for my food with my boyfriend and he got it before me. However, one of the employee came up to us every 5 minutes and apologized for the wait. At the end it was worth the wait! I would recommend anyone who lives near UCF or pass by UCF to give this place a try!"
6/1/2019,1,"Aside from the fact that I just saw a cockroach on the table behind me while looking for soy sauce because my table didn't have any, the food was late and almost forgotten by the staff. I probably won't be visiting this location again because of the cockroach incident. The manager sat at the table where I saw it with another employee and tried to catch it. When it crawled into the booth behind them, they acted like they didn't even see it. That was definitely not expected and is especially disturbing because this place serves raw fish! I loved the food before this but I don't think I can come back. The manager said they do their best but here's a question...if a cockroach was on a table with plenty of patrons around, what is lurking in the kitchen?"
1/11/2016,4,"My coworkers commonly come to this place for lunch since it is so close to us. I wouldn't say that it's a super authentic type of Asian cuisine place but this is still a great place to come and get some quick and delicious Asian inspired entrees. I really love coming here on Tuesday as they have tea Tuesday where you can buy one boba tea and get another for free! Their boba teas are actually very good and have some cool combinations, I'd recommend trying the royal if you're a coffee lover.As far as food goes, they do have tasty choices, but nothing I'd rave over that I'd go out of the way to get. However it is affordable and decent for what you are getting. I'd suggest a bento box as this gives you a variety of things to sample. Service can be okay, since it's open seating for lunch servers just come by and look for your table number that you received when you ordered at the front of the restaurant. Sometimes that can get confused during the busy times of the day and can take longer than expected, but no more than 10 minutes. Overall I do enjoy Bentos and really do enjoy the atmosphere and vibe they give off for a quick style service restaurant."
1/31/2020,4,Super yummy food and fast service. Just a little small and over crowded during lunch time
9/1/2015,3,"A cool, hip, minimal atmosphere, I kind of felt like I was rolling into a Japanese night club. This isn't a bad thing, just not what I was expecting at 11am on a Tuesday.The service was pretty snail-paced, considering how few people were in the house. We waited to order for nearly 10 minutes and waited a bit longer to receive our food. Everyone seemed rather kind, just not the most efficient.The old band-aid sitting on the first table we sat down at kind of threw me off... No no no, Bento. That is yuck! The second table was nice and band-aid free.Most people probably wouldn't think twice about this, but as a wheelchair user, the space was rather cramped and not super easy to navigate (even with these sweet driving skills). Too many tables, too many ropes, too close together. I ordered a Mango Milk Tea, which was a bit too sweet for my taste buds. Next time, I'll try the regular milk tea which is supposed to be less sweet.My friend ordered a tofu bento box and enjoyed parts of it. Nothing life-changing, but it was a decent lunch."
9/1/2015,3,"I wasn't expecting an authentic and true Japanese cultural experience by any means, but I do believe Bento could do better at what they are trying to accomplish. The environment is somewhat imaginative in a minimalist/modern way, which I enjoyed. The service was iffy. As soon as I walked in, I was in a line of 3 people waiting to order my food.  It took about 8 minutes until it was my turn to order. Way too long of a wait for a near empty restaurant at 11am. Once I chose a table with my friend, our boba teas and food took about 10 minutes to get to us. Again, not bad, but the place was empty. Once my bento box arrived, the employee asked if I needed a fork or chopsticks.  An obvious question to which she left to bring me an eating utensil 3-4 minutes later. The bento box was so-so. I got the red curry with vegetables and tofu. The tofu was tough and rubbery, but the vegetables and the curry sauce made up for that. The ginger salad wasn't too impressive. It contained a few pieces of lettuce drowned in dressing.  The rest of the food in the bento box was okay. Nothing impressive enough to mention. My jasmine milk boba tea  was really good. Not too sweet and very refreshing.  I'm looking forward to trying the sushi next time I visit. Maybe that can redeem my feelings on this establishment."
3/15/2018,4,"I really like bento. This is one of the most decent Asian food places I've been to. Of course it's not authentic, but it's really good food nonetheless. I usually order the teriyaki chicken. It's nicely charred, which pleasantly surprised me. The veggies are also super good, although I wish I got to pick when I get green beans vs broccoli. I've also had their sushi. I'd say the sushi box is a pretty good deal! You get a decent amount of sushi (I think you get to pick a roll and you get a California roll). It's pretty good! Service isn't super quick here, but for the quality of food I still go. They're always really helpful and courteous."
8/1/2015,4,"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened (I keep forgetting about it! Lol) and I finally made it! We got a few rolls and shared them so we could try little bit of everything. -The garlic edamame was good. -Miso soup was ok; a little salty and the seaweed was very chewy. -Crunch roll was good, but not tempura batter. It was deep fried or something. Not crazy about the batter or whatever they used but the roll was good. -Spicy tuna roll wasn't great. The only that made it spicy was spicy mayo. That is my staple roll and it bums be out when it's not done right. -I did he make your own Kuwaii roll and it would have been good if they used a different kind of lettuce. It was big and thick and overpowered everything else. You couldn't taste anything but lettuce, which is a bummer. -Red dragon roll was great and will definitely get it again!The best thing on the menu is that you can design your own roll!! How awesome is that!?I didn't even look at their non-sushi menu but everything that came out looked good. I look forward to going back!"
9/18/2015,4,"I have friends who aren't particularly crazy about Bento....but it's close to home, always a great spot for takeout after work, and it tastes pretty good too! This spot is a winner in my heart! Their tuna tataki salad is my usual, but their rainbow roll is pretty delicious too!"
5/30/2018,5,"I've visited this location many times. The food and service has always been great. I love their tofu. I got lo main noodle with vegetable stir fry. It was good as always. I will definitely be coming back! P.S. if you check in on Facebook, they give $1 off."
9/12/2015,3,"My cousin and her roommates recommended this place. My aunt really likes this place as well. My first impression wasnt too well since when my bento box arrived. The steak was completely burnt! ! I didnt realize this until my 2nd or 3rd piece. My throat felt weird and sore. When i flipped the meat over, it was absolutely charred black. I called over a server and showed her. They told me it wasn't suppose to be that grilled up. I waited for a new one but by the time i arrived everyone finished eating. I did enjoy my groupies watching me eat. #PaparazziMode The salad and green beans were my favorite. My mom ordered a Rice Bowl with curry katsu beef. It was very tasty. I prefer that than the beef teriyaki bento box i had. I was able to try the chicken teriyaki bento box that was better than the beef bento but not as good as the curry beef.Overall:Bad experience with the burnt steak but the curry beef made up for it. Three stars only this time. Next time i will try the sushi and hopefully higher ratings!"
1/10/2017,5,"Bento is one of my all time favorite places to eat. The staff is always pleasant when we stop in for lunch, and the atmosphere is typical of what you'd expect from a restaurant close to a busy university.For fellow wheelchair users, getting through the front line can be a bit tricky, and some tables are difficult to get to if it's busy, but the restaurant as a whole is fairly wheelchair friendly. It can get busy during the typical lunch rush hours, but things usually move quickly.I'm a creature of habit and usually wind up ordering the same thing every time: Spicy Cream Chicken Noodle Bowl with a Creamsaver milk tea. I've also tried the Katsu Chicken Bento Box in the past and it was delicious. If you're ever in the area I recommend stopping by!"
9/16/2015,4,"The Bento Cafe brand, If you are not familiar with them, is a small chain of seven restaurants with more on the way, that offers a creative mixture of Asian inspired dishes from wok stir-fry to fire-grilled items to sushi using the finest Asian spices and the freshest ingredients all at great prices.The concept at Bento is to bring unique and authentic Asian food in a fast and efficient manner. Everything on the menu is cooked to order and prepared in minutes and served up in an atmosphere that is fun, friendly and stylish. The word ""Bento"" means boxed-meal in Japanese, and they have a wide selection of traditional boxed meals, but the menu includes a wide variety of sushi rolls, sashimi, nigiri and chirashi bowls as well as soups, udon noodles, rice bowls and noodle bowls. They also offer Boba Tea, a popular Asian beverage that is consisted of milk tea and chewy tapioca pearls.Every store is designed differently which makes visiting each Bento Cafe an experience. Each store will be either dominated by the warm red dragon colors or the cool blue dragon colors. Each Bento has a sushi station, but the UCF location has seats at the sushi bar, so you can watch the chefs prepare your rolls live and in person. Speaking of sushi, the Jade roll with marinated spicy tuna, eel, avocado, krab delite, masago, scallions and eel sauce tasted just as good as it looked. For my entree, I chose the the Sesame Wok Stir Fry bowl. This dish comes with your choice of chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu and red bell peppers, snow peas, onions, baby corn in a sesame soy sauce. I really enjoyed the flavors, and the portion was more than I could eat. Now, I really did enjoy my entree selection, but it would be dishonest of me not to tell you that I was really jealous of my wife's Bento Box. She opted for the Sriracha Garlic Chicken in a bento box. You can get chicken, shrimp or tofu grilled or fried with red bell peppers and onions with a sweet and spicy Sriracha sauce for dipping. Bento boxes come with your choice of steamed rice or lo mein, ginger salad, and string beans and a dessert"
9/28/2020,4,I really enjoyed my meal! Asian food is always best served when it's hot so I suggest eating in the restaurant if you're comfortable with that!
4/24/2019,5,"I've been eating at Bento for about 10 years now, starting with one of their locations in Jacksonville. The menu offers a ton of different options and even has a large selection for vegetarians. My go-to meal is the spicy cream chicken Bento box (I think they changed the name of it). It includes all you could ask for, in small portions, for a perfect meal. I can't comment on the sushi because I've never tried it from a Bento location."
5/22/2017,3,I had really been in the mood for Bento's!  I usually visit the location in Dr. Phillips.  This location was different as right when you entered you placed your order and they bring it to your table.  Which threw me off for a minute.  Once we sat down our food came out before the appetizer of egg rolls and I had to ask for them several times.  The food was okay.  It just needed little more umph to be up to the Dr. Phillips location standards but it was okay for filling my mood for Bento's!
11/26/2019,2,"Subpar food, chicken was charred to a crisp, I get $6 bowls on Tuesday is a deal but quality is suffering. I also found a piece of plastic in my food. Got a combo, no green tea which I usually get as my favorite. Although I saved a ton of money, my experience feels like a two star experience."
6/23/2017,4,"I came here with a few friends on a Friday for lunch. As packed as it was during the noon lunch rush, the line and patrons moved pretty swiftly so we had our food within 10 minutes or so of walking in. The prices are good and the combinations of food can be overwhelming. I went with the chicken curry katsu with the udon noodles. It wasn't quite as spicy as advertised but the udon noodles made it a pretty filling entree. The fried chicken it was served with wasn't anything to write home about so I doubt I'd get that combo again. I got the pork spring rolls too which were a nice side, but they came out a little cold in the middle. I'd probably come back again, just not during the lunch hour."
11/13/2019,3,"Inconsistent portion sizes(seen in pic 1 seaweed salad). A lot of ginger, little ginger, no ginger. Customer service is below mediocre. The food was good 6.2/10"
7/13/2019,1,"Just had their volcano roll and was highly disappointed. It tastes very cheap, which is upsetting since it's an expensive roll. They use imitation crab and whatever sauce that's on top tastes like it's heavy on the mayo. Won't be returning"
9/2/2020,2,This perfect word to describe the food here is literally mediocre. Not bad but would never pay for it again
6/18/2019,5,"We love coming here for a quick bite to eat. The food and service is always great! Even when the line is long, it moves quickly. The food comes out as it's prepared, but the wait in between entrees isn't long. Some of my favorite items are the Pao Pao and Special Mexican. Also one of the staff, Ivy, is always so nice and professional! She always checks in on how the food came out and if we ever need anything else."
8/20/2018,3,"Updating this review,  I was contact by the manager  and all is well.  He promptly reached out to me and corrected the problem."
8/15/2019,1,Well to start I tried the Pineapple Sweet + Sour noodle bowl with chicken and veggies for the first time a few days ago and it tasted good and had no problems. But now ordering from them again today it sent me to the bathroom twice so most likely will not be ordering from them again and is why I've given them one star and would not recommend anyone eat there. The Green Teas are nice though.
8/14/2018,5,I LOOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!Their food is delicious. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. There are many options to choose from. They have some of the best sushi and give you good portions for what you pay. Everyone here is so nice. I always come here at least once a month.
8/31/2015,4,"It was good. It felt like a modernized thai/sushi place, like a Burger 21 for thai & sushi.I got the red curry bento box with beef, and it is everything you need in a meal. It comes with rice, noodle, some green beans (I'm not sure), ginger salad, and this little fried things with some kind of frosted glaze on them. So you get everything; appetizer, meal, sides, and dessert. And with a fountain drink, it all came to just under $13, you are going to be hard pressed to find a full meal for that.I need to head back here and try some sushi."
9/18/2019,3,"Was very excited to try Bento for the first time. I was anticipating the great experience I heard from my friends so when I showed up in person I had high expectations. We waited quite a long time for two bowls and a roll of sushi and it was very hot in there like the air-conditioner must've broken. We got home with our to go food to find that one of the bowls has human hair lodged into the food. I spent a considerable amount of money on this meal and I'm very disappointed with the outcome of my experience. I tried to call in the phone and I got hung up on because the phone doesn't even allow a human interaction to occur. If you want hairy food and no human contact the Bento Asian kitchen on Strategy Boulevard is your place. Sushi was good though.*** update ***Since I live in close proximity to Bento I decided to try it again. I had to call twice to get someone on the line, and the man was nice. However, after I came to get my pickup order after the allotted time I was given, the woman at the bar didn't even acknowledge me for the first five minutes. She immediately made me pay and I had waiter 20 minutes over my waiting time. This is absolutely ridiculous. They also told me I would be rewarded with a ""gift card"" for my last troubles here and never even followed through. Bad business"
1/9/2019,4,"Bento is good. I wouldn't say it's great though. The food is good, I enjoy the atmosphere, and the service is okay. I would definitely eat here again, I wouldn't get the bento box though. It sounds great because it comes with a lot of everything, but everything they give is mediocre in taste. Get the actual dishes like the rice/ noodle Bowls. The flavors are way better!"
4/11/2015,5,"I think it's a great place for a fast lunch/dinner. You have many options of entree in Bento, Bowl or Noodle bowl style. They also have sushi and boba milk tea. The price is fair. I think for the quality of food you get the price is pretty good. They bring the food to your table. I've tried Japanese-style curry pork katsu, teriyaki chicken and Sichuan chicken. I always order them in bentobox (because I want vegetable as the side) with a boba milk tea. Delicious!"
3/24/2015,4,"I think the biggest disappointment about this location is the fact that it's not called Bento Gold D: I heard rumors that the UCF location was going to be Bento Gold and I was like yooo that's so awesome! But it's just Bento Red though. -tears-But anyway, I was happy with my food. I've been to the other locations in Orlando and Gainesville, but this one is probably my favorite. I typically order the Chicken Curry Katsu rice bowl, and what I really liked is that the piece of chicken was huge! It was definitely a good portion and felt like the price was reasonable. The service was good too, the food came out a lot faster than I expected even though it was a bit busy.My friend got a Korean Chicken noodle bowl which was just okay in my opinion, I'd stick to the Curry Katsu. Also, I was a bit disappointed with their boba. I ordered the Jasmine Milk Tea and the boba was definitely undercooked. It was way too hard in the center and took forever to chew. The tea itself tasted almost powdery too.Overall, I'm happy there is a Bento right next to the UCF campus and will probably be back soon [:"
4/12/2019,3,"I was very disappointed with this place. A lot of people from school say this place is great but I had an ""eh"" experience. From the start there was a guy taking orders then a girl came up to him and said ""I don't really feel like doing anything so I'll take orders"" and they switched. She was now taking orders. I went to order and when I was mid sentence she turned around and added to a conversation and then turned back to be and said ""now what was that again?"". The food was ok just really salty (as to be expected with Asian food). We went to sit down and the gentleman (same from earlier) took dirty dishes off the table but did not come back to wipe the table off. I asked another girl to have someone wipe it off and she never came back, I ended up wiping it off myself.(which is not a big deal but it was still annoying on top o the less than thrilling experience we were already having)"
5/29/2017,4,"I love Bento cafe. I eat here at least once a week, usually for takeout. The food is usually fresh, the service is cordial, and everything is delicious. My only complaint is when I try to call to place an order ahead.  On more than one occasion, I have been placed on hold for over ten minutes waiting to place the order. Sometimes I have to hang up and call again, and then hang up and call again. By the time I get a hold of someone, I'm already down the street from the restaurant, which defeats the purpose of calling ahead. Once you get past this trivial issue, I highly recommend bento for some delicious Asian cuisine. They have a dual-sided menu to cater to everyone's needs. The blue side is the sushi menu- rolls, bowls, and other raw (okay not all raw) delicacies. My recommendations on this cool side of the pillow are the Chirashi bowl and the Mt. Fuji roll. I'm sure there is something fried in the Fuji roll which makes my taste buds sing Hallelujah. The Chirashi bowl is a sticky rice bowl with different sashimi and veggies- my ""healthy"" alternative. Filling, delicious, and makes me feel so accomplished when I can haul rice in my mouth my chopsticks.The red side are ""hot foods""- rice or noodle bowls, or a bento box. They have a varied amount of flavor options and cooking methods for your choice of meat (chicken, shrimp, pork, tofu, veggie). My absolute favorites are the red curry shrimp brown rice bowl and the Asian Cajun chicken mini-udon bowl. The red curry is milky and deliciously ! And don't get me started on the noodles- I have to fight myself every time I walk by bento not to order them. I eat them so often, I am basically a mini udon noodle. Their service in restaurant is great, friendly staff, good food. Perfect place to bring your date so you can figure out if their food taste sucks, because if they hate everything on this menu, then there is something wrong with them."
8/15/2020,1,Good food but absolutely horrendous service. After a 45 minutes wait and watching two parties who ordered after us we were ignored by the staff when asking about our order. The staffs attitude will keep me from ever coming back despite the food. Would give .zero stars if possible.
2/12/2019,1,"I feel like the food has really changed lately and it was for the worse. Am I the only one noticing the portion of food in the rice bowls has gotten smaller? Also, it seems that they're using this super chewy beef that is impossible to chew unless you have knives for teeth. It's super unappetizing and its even worse when it comes out cold.  Yet, the prices rose but the quality of food has gone down. I won't be eating there again, period."
3/22/2018,3,I haven't been here for a while and it has fallen off..... When did Mongolian chicken get mushrooms added to the recipe?It took a while for my sweet and sour bowl to get to the table (is not bad) - my hubby was practically done with his food before mine got to me.I'm disappointed and don't think I'll be back
5/15/2015,4,"Bento is a counter service type of restaurant, where you order and then bring a number back to your table.  I stopped in for some noodles, and ended up choosing the Udon noodles for lunch along with a side of steamed dumplings.The noodles were a decent portion but I would have like just a little bit more for the price. Both the dumplings and the noodles were flavorful and well-prepared, the restaurant itself is clean, and the staff seemed friendly based on my limited interaction with them.First impression was overall a good one, so I'll be back to try some other stuff."
6/22/2017,3,"Family outing for lunch and one of my cousins chose Bento. We all either got rice bowl or noodle bowls. The menu is fantastic and the food is good! But there is only one problem I have, it's dirty. First, our table was sticky and disgusting so someone had to come wipe it down, most of our silverware had dried up food on them, and the to-go boxes had some type of black dust in them (good thing we looked before entering our leftovers). The beverage station was also incredibly sticky and had this weird smell surrounding it, there was flies in the trash and it was basically just a mess with all types of drinks spilled across the counter. Again, the food was great and the menu is wonderful but I don't know about the cleanliness of this establishment."
6/26/2020,5,"I always love eating here, the variety is incredible! Also their new online ordering platform makes takeout a breeze!"
6/24/2019,3,"I ordered a to go order, it was a bitter sweet experience. I loved their boba. Unfortunately our bento boxes were cold, and our lo mein tasted like cold pasta salad."
6/20/2019,5,Sasha and Nerenid have been the best bartenders I've experienced in a long time. They were super attentive and paid a lot of attention to us at the bar. They took our orders quickly and was super conscious we didn't distract them so we could get our orders quickly as they were so easy to talk to. Definitely will be returning just because of their attentiveness and great service!
4/11/2019,3,"Bento has such a variety of foods to choose from! The food is delicious, and it's very convenient being close to UCF. However, I've been there about four times, and three out of the four my order came out wrong. I received sushi when I ordered a bowl, or my bowl had the wrong meat and sides in it. But other then that, a very nice place for lunch or dinner with friends!"
6/12/2019,5,"My sister and I came into bentos thinking we were going to have a casual lunch until we met TOMMY, he was so helpful and it really helps that he has a contagious smile as well! He is great and fun and we will definitely continue our business here because of the awesome experience."
8/29/2018,1,"Got bento to go last night, price for a bowl with fried rice and mongolian beef was pretty crazy expensive for what it was, ($14+tax) but I decided to splurge because I really wanted the fried rice vs. white. The rice change was $5 added to the $9 for the standard bowl. What a colossal waste of money. It did not taste good, the meat has a very odd, fakey texture, and I woke up with horrible food poisoning and have been sick all day. Definitely never going back. :-( Doctor also said he has heard of quite a few people getting sick here before. Avoid!"
7/31/2016,4,"They have good rice bowls and noodle dishes. The sushi is okay. The place itself is spacious and offers a variety of seating options. If you want a fast asian dining experience, Bento is the way to go."
3/10/2017,5,"Been coming here fairly regularly for their poké bowls. You order at the counter, get a number and sit and wait. Service is always pretty fast even when it's super busy! I love the amount of food you can get in the bowl, two meats for $10, can't beat it!"
2/5/2019,5,"This place is good, always seems to be busy with a friendly staff. Went for the bold your own poke bowl with crab and shrimp.....oh so yummy. Sauce comes on the side choice of two and a good selection of ingredients. I'm visiting from southern Cali and wish we had one there?"
6/16/2016,1,"The food was great, but towards the end of my meal I found METAL in my chicken! When I told the manager she said it happens all of the time because of the scrubbers they use on their woks. Obviously if this happens more than once there is an issue that should be resolved. This piece of metal was very sharp and I could've easily cut my mouth. She was nice about it, but basically told me that there was nothing that could be done. If this was a one time thing it would be ok but there is no excuse to use the same scrubbers if it happens ""all of the time."" It makes me wonder if they are just waiting for someone to slice their cheek open before they change their wok scrubbers. I uploaded pictures in the pictures section."
6/30/2019,3,"Food is ok; nothing special. It's Americanized Asian fusion of sorts with decent and fresh ingredients. However, service happens to be rather slow. The line to order at the register is almost always out the door so if you do order, I recommend doing so at the bar or calling in beforehand.The most recent time I ordered take out here, I waited nearly 45 minutes before my poke order was completed. Now I am no expert of restauranteering, but 45 minutes is quite a time for food that does not need much cooking as it is served raw; especially when other orders that were made after mine were delivered earlier."
8/12/2016,3,"Terrible sushi - regular white rice used, not sushi rice (was not treated with vinegar, salt and sugar). Typical buffet quality - which is fine for a buffet, but not for when you are paying by the roll. Decent price considering the quality, but there are alternatives nearby.The bowl (yellow chicken curry with udon) was generous in size and decent quality.Probably not worth going here for the sushi."
2/11/2016,3,"Not bad. I'd go to Bento Cafe again because we got carryout and it looks like this is a place I'd probably enjoy more eating in. The sushi was nothing too special and it actually reminded me of sushi I've gotten at a grocery store (Wegman's). It just wasn't as fresh as I would prefer. However, I was in a rush and scarfed it down kind of fast because I was starving. As I said, I'd like to go back, sit down, get a cocktail and take time to look over the menu to try a few different rolls. It was nice to get $1 off when my DD checked in on Facebook."
11/19/2016,4,"This has become somewhat of a regular spot for lunch when I'm in the area for work. It's always fast and good, which makes it perfect for a quick lunch spot.There's nothing overly exceptionally great about the food, and it's a bit pricey for what it is, but it's consistently very good.I usually go with a Bento box and split a roll with the friend I go with. We both always leave full and happy. Can't ask for much more."
2/15/2020,5,Love love loveeee this place. Pao Pao Chicken rice bowl is always my go to. The only thing I would have to say is... PLEASE START USING APPLE PAY!!!!
8/14/2018,5,"Bento Cafe.. where do I begin?! I first tried this place in Gainesville about 8 years ago and I fell in love with them because of their famous dish, spicy cream chicken. Lightly battered chicken tossed with a spicy cream sauce is so addicting! I usually get that dish whenever I would visit Gainesville from WPB and each time was consistent. Now that they expanded to Orlando with three locations, my addition to them has grown! Their sushi is pretty good as well and I like how in some rolls you can get it for half portion. I've never had a bad meal here and I will continue to go here frequency!"
4/7/2018,4,"I love Bento! You can easily customize your food by choosing a rice bowl, noodle bowl or bento box. I love the bento box because you get a little bit of everything  you get lo mein, rice, salad, your main entree, string beans and a fried wonton dessert. It's plenty of food for less than $10!  I haven't tried their sushi or sushi boxes but I plan to the next time I'm there."
3/29/2020,1,The wait at this place is absolutely absurd. I waited over thirty minutes for one order to feed one person. When I asked on the progress of my meal I was greeted with hostility and impatience. I watched employees laugh and take their time as if there wasn't over twenty people waiting for their food in the midst of the corona virus. Absolute nightmare
3/28/2019,5,"Came to Florida on a work trip for 10 days... and I are here 5 times! Tried multiple dishes and each one was delicious. The sushi rolls aren't bad (I'm a bit of a sushi snob), but I highly recommend the bowls! Also, the spicy mayo is addictive!"
9/20/2016,5,"Great for lunch! Rice, noodle or bento box options, pair it with a main. Sushi looks decent."
10/19/2015,3,"Service is super friendly and nice, ordered over the phone and pick up was easy peasy. I've dined at Bento's DT area and DP areas before, both serve good affordable food. UCF's Bentos might be using different ratios to make their sauces, because the Japanese stir fry noodles I ordered were super duper bland. I am usually pretty sensitive to salt, so I found this super surprising! It's all chill though, I just went home and reboiled it with some seasoned dashistock and ate the udon noodles that way. Will give it a second try someday, but please double check your sauce ratios(?)"
4/15/2018,4,"Great discovery while visiting Orlando. Located not too far from UCF. This place is very trendy, great music and overall ambiance. The girl at the register, the runner and the manager were very polite. The manager handled a little situation (hair) we ran into with our food with care and respect. The Bento Box was well sized and tasteful. The Boba drink was good. Great selection of boba drinks on the menu. Overall certainly a place I'd go again and have a great time enjoying their food and drinks."
2/5/2020,5,Love this place! The food is always good and staff are friendly. Very good sushi made to order. The rice bowls are amazing. The prices are very reasonable and not overly expensive for the sushi. Will definitely be back.
1/16/2016,1,"Terrible Service, Mediocre Food. We went in and ordered the promo meal that was on their social network because the meal promised a free select appetizer to go with. Upon ordering the manager tells us the only options are edamame or miso soup, so we changed our orders.The food arrives at the table, the sushi.. BlahThe bento boxes came shortly after and my dates food was incorrect. After flagging down 3 people I finally got a manger to the table that said that she heard things went wrong but knew they were in the kitchen making the food fresh. If two people order together, why do people think letting both plates sit on the table and get cold while waiting for the new plate is acceptable? Why would I eat and my date is there disappointed and hungry.Overall this place is subpar and the service is like all of the other restaurants in the UCF area. This place is laughable."
6/19/2017,5,"Too many good things to say about this place, stop reading reviews and give it a shot! P.S. It's fine if you don't know what you want and want to browse the menu, but DO NOT GET IN LINE UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO ORDER. Thanks. :)"
1/27/2019,1,"So, here are all my reasons why I will never return and would not ever recommend this place. 1. The miso soup was not hot, and flavorless even with a bunch of salt and pepper added. 2. Crab Wontons were soaked with grease from the fryer, also flavorless - served with a disgusting sweet chili sauce. 3. All our sushi's rice was warm - which made the rolls warm. 4. We ordered the sushi's with no fish eggs, one of the four we ordered was served with fish eggs on top of it and it took 25 mins to get it remake(had it was packaged to go because they were now closed)5. The service was not the best, felt like an inconvenience to be there. No napkins anywhere to be found. 6. All the tables were dirty.7. Way over priced for what they offer - spent $48 and went to McDonald's next door and bought two $2.25 double cheese burgers."
4/26/2016,4,"The fire alarm went off during the middle of the meal and no one even flinches. I did hear a staff groan ""Not again!"" but I still enjoyed my meal. A waitress helped us move our plates to the patio seating area since it was slightly quieter than being inside. While munching on my protein bowl salad with shitake mushrooms, seared tuna, asparagus,  and cucumbers we watched the fire department arrive and the people who lived in the adjacent apartments slowly evacuate. My neo tokyo sushi roll is was like a spring roll and their sauce seemed a lot spicier than the Sand Lake location."
7/23/2018,5,"I've never had a bad experience with their food, service, or boba teas. Shout out to all Bento Cafe's out there. Keep up the good work :)"
7/5/2015,3,"I went here recently with my wife and a few friends who were visiting for a late lunch. The restaurant is very hip with lounge music playing and plenty of TVs showing various sporting events. In addition to this, there is a sushi bar near the front and what looks like a full liquor bar near the side. This is also a mix between a quick service restaurant and the standard sit down restaurant. You place your order at the front, are given a number, and your food is brought to you. Given this set up, I can tell that if you came here on a busy night, you might be waiting for some time before you have your order takent.However, their are plenty of staff running around who are more than happy to grab you utensils or extra packets of sauce.The good: Being fairly new, this place is very clean and the staff is very attentive. Our orders were promptly taken and just a few minutes after we had filled our drink cups at the Coke freestyle machine and sat down, our food was delivered. The staff came by multiple times to ask us if we needed anything, which was nice. We tried a few of the different sauces they offered and were quite happy with the white sauce (who doesn't love the white sauce, right?)The bad: For the price I paid for my wife and I to have a basic lunch (she only had fried rice, I had teriyaki chicken over noodles, and we both had soft drinks), I was taken a bit aback. It was just over $21 for these few items. So when our food was delivered I was again disappointed that there was not much food and disappointed in the quality. My chicken teriyaki over noodles wasn't much better than if I had gone to Panda Express just down the road. I know... I know... I really wanted to like this place. I had been to the location downtown before but in all honesty, it wasn't a very memorable experience. After many of my friends had told me to try the one over by UCF, I figured ""why not?"" Overall, my experience was lacking and I would rate this place as average."
2/1/2016,4,Delicious food and sushi but I do not recommend the boba tea. It is pretty hard and the tea tastes pretty artificial.
3/25/2018,3,"I've been to the Bento Cafe in downtown Orlando and it is excellent; nice atmosphere, nicely decorated, and great food.However, this is Bento Cafe UCF...umph.  Definitely a college restaurant.  Looks just like a fast food chain inside and you wouldn't know it was the same as the Orlando Bentos.  While the food was good, the extra $2 up charge for over cooked tofu in my bento box was sad.  I didn't think you could over cook tofu until it was rubbery brown on the outside and the consistency of old French toast on the inside.  If you ""must"" have it, ask them to pay you the $2 for ordering."
5/31/2018,5,Best Asian food by ucf hands down! Definitely try the spicy cream chicken either in a bento box or noodle bowl. Can't wait to go back and try their sushi!
12/3/2019,5,Was super hungry and not sure what I wanted to eat. Christina at the counter as well as another male employee were super enthusiastic and helpful. Very happy with the quality of service I received.
4/1/2015,4,"This was my first time going to any Bento Cafe. I know there are locations downtown and in Gainesville, but I've never had the occasion to go. So, my perspective is a fresh one without comparison.The place is located in the New University Plaza, built over the graveyard remnants of Old University Plaza. I'd like to think that buried underneath the concrete are the memories of the past: Shattered glass from that one time Bobby got totally wasted at The Library and smashed a bottle of Miller Light over Patrick's head because he looked to be trying to steal his girlfriend Jennifer. And somewhere, there are Jennifer's old lost contact lenses, which she lost the night she accidentally kissed the wrong guy who then got assaulted by some random bro afterwards. Enter: Bento Cafe.The line was spilling out the door slightly, but it moved quickly. The place is a lot larger than it looks -- there is plenty of seating: small tables, larger tables, sushi bar, drink bar. The interior has bright, simple colors (primarily black and red) assembled together with a staggering symmetry. The place* looks* like a Bento Box. If intentional, kudos to the design team. If unintentional, that's funny. Aesthetics aside, it's all very shiny and new and trendy. Hopefully it stays that way, because it's all very pulled together and sleek at the moment. I ordered the Basil Chicken. I was going to get a Bento box, but they wouldn't let me sub in brown rice. I don't make a fuss about such things, even though I didn't quite understand why. I mean, it's a scoop of rice in a tray. Still intent on actually getting brown rice, I switched to a rice bowl, which does allow you to sub in brown rice for an extra $1. Fortunately, the bowl was satisfying. There was plenty of basil and it was quite flavorful. The portion size wasn't gigantic, but it's a solid lunch portion. If you are on a gainer diet, you should probably go for double meat or get some kind of sides. MINOR UPDATE: I have been informed by someone who works at Bento (more specifically someone I randomly met at a party who coincidentally had read my review, life is strange) that you can in fact sub in brown rice in the bento box. Whoever did my order just probably didn't know. It's a new location, so the employees are still learning the menu.I'll have to come back to check out the sushi and boba. I'm excited to have yet another lunch option in the UCF/Research Park area. Still, it's strange to see the locale transform so much. We thought in the future we'd have flying cars, but instead we eat bento boxes inside of a giant bento box. I'm glad we have our priorities straight."
5/29/2015,4,"Bento: fast and delicious Asian food in a casual environment. Right by UCF, this restaurant has a modern, clean interior with a sushi bar, Coca-Cola freestyle machine, and plenty of tables, along with a few booths. I've visited a few times, getting noodle bowls, bento boxes, and sushi, and I'd have to say that their sushi is average but their noodle bowls are delicious. Pad thai is my favorite dish, although not spicy, it's great with sriracha. Their food is very reasonably priced for the amount you get- not huge portions, but a good amount for lunch or dinner. The concept of Bento is great and the execution matches. I would highly recommend you try it."
1/12/2016,4,Surprisingly decent. I'm typically in favor of a hole in the wall type but in a new city I decided to try try something near. The food tastes somewhat bland but still good.
9/7/2019,4,"Food is good. I like the variety, and the preparation is pretty fresh. My complaint is that the music is too loud, but it is a college hang out and I'm older. Also the tables and chairs need to be cleaned more regularly, when the food is removed, someone should wipe the tables down. I've had to wipe down my own table a couple times."
5/18/2019,3,"Good food and a lot of workers but if you dine in prepare to wait a LONG time. No matter how long the line is there is always one cashier. The rest of the employees will look at the line but none will come help the poor lone cashier.  Even if the line is out the door...one cashier. Get your food to go and you can skip the line and  get your food from the bar. If not,  bring a book to read while you wait in line...or write a Yelp review. I started typing this at the end of the like with my back touching the door I am still not to the halfway point in the line. I type slow due to fat thumbitis."
1/27/2018,5,"I got the pineapple fried rice to go, which was more than enough food. I was craving fried rice & it was a great choice. I would definitely recommend this place for vegetarians. Dating a vegetarian; When you can go to the same restaurant & both find something you like, then it's a winner."
9/3/2018,5,I love Bento's! They have many locations and this one is definitely targeted more towards college students but the quality of food and service is consistent throughout all their locations - excellent!
3/24/2015,5,"Had the Mongolian tofu bento box, side of miso soup, and a boba drink with mango poppers. SO GOOOD!!! New favorite place. Loved the outside seating too."
9/28/2015,3,"Was in the area so stopped by for lunch. It was really busy. Heard it was good from a friend who went to the Bento Café in Gainesville. It was ok. I've had better. Had the jalapeno roll, miso soup and the spicy cream bento box. If you want a quick sushi spot, this place is ok. But, if you want really good sushi....um....lots of better places."
10/12/2017,4,I love bento! The crunch roll is my favorite and I love how affordable everything is without sacrificing quality. The only thing that kind of turns me off is that instant miso soup machine they have put behind the counter. I don't want to know my miso soup is instant! Turn off lol
4/11/2015,4,"Love All The Previous 1s Visited Here In Orlando Metro (Downtown & On Sand Lake) Area & They Just Did Me A Huge Favor By Opening A New 1 Near Work & Across From My Favorite Florida University (UCF!) Gotta Love It  & My Craving The Other Day For Sushi Was Large So No 2nd Thoughts On Where To Go Even When The Line Was Out The Door Was Well Worth It. The Sushi Combo Box Always The Way To Go When On The Run & Is A Great Value, Enjoyed It & Will Now Be Apart of Regular Lunch Rotation #AGoodThing"
4/1/2015,4,"Three and a half stars rounded up to four. It is awesome to see what Bento has become. I remember the old days stopping by Gainesville on my way up to Tallahassee just for Bento. Now the Bento Group is slowly taking over Florida. For what the concept is of Bento, I think it they will do great at this location as with all their other locations. The food is quick, tasty, and caters to all tastes and cravings. On our first visit my fiancee went with a garlic chicken udon bowl and I ordered a chirashi and lava roll. The ratio of noodles to meat and veggies seemed to be a bit off in her bowl. It was a ton of noodles. The garlic chicken was good though, it had that nice ""wok-burn"" taste to it. My chirashi was pretty standard and the lava roll was just okay. No saucer was brought out with my sushi so I had to find the take out sauce containers myself. Not too big of a deal, but just some small kinks they need to work out with a recent opening."
9/30/2019,1,poor excuse for sushi. the second time this place has let us down. all rolls were cold as if they were refridgerated for quick orders. i don't recommend this place at all.
7/10/2018,1,"This Bento Cafe has SERIOUS safety issues. A huge piece of scrap metal fell on me as i was getting my drink, and hit me on my torso and then to the ground. I was shocked when it happened, as were the other customers around me. I told the manager about it and he just brushed it off. All he said was he didn't know how it could have happened. I'm a nice person, but the next person this happens to should sue! Watch out for yourself when you're in there. They don't care about customers safety."
9/4/2015,2,"Co-worker recommended this place and so I gave it a shot last week. I am always excited to try a new sushi place, as its one of my top 3 foods.  This location is directly in front of the University, so expect lunch time to be a bit busy.  With that said, service was quick and friendly, kudos. What I have learned about sushi over the years is that it can come down to ""you get what you pay for"", as with many things in life.  I say this because the prices are very good, but the amount is deceiving.  The amount of fish and veggies in each roll is misleading by the size of the roll.  If you look closely, they use a lot of rice to give the appearance of a typical roll, but in fact, there is very little fish and veggie per roll.  Very disappointing.  The fish seemed fresh, however.I really wished I could give them 2.5 stars, but will settle for 2.  There are several other places not far from Bento that offer more, but I'll leave that up to you.I had high hopes but walked away disappointed."
3/31/2015,3,"Good, but not really worth the hype. I've been hearing about Bento for ages, but have never had the opportunity to drive out to one of their locations. Naturally, when I heard they were opening another location near UCF, I was super excited!! I visited Bento last night and was just not very impressed. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and added tofu. After ordering and sitting down, the girl brought my food but informed me ""the girl at the register had made a mistake and we can't add tofu to this bowl in the future, just so you know..."" although it gives the option on the bottom of the menu. The portions were big, but there was nothing amazing about my meal. The bowl consisted of noodles and chicken, with hardly any sauce and didn't even stir fried veggies or anything else in it. I personally think Pei Wei is much better for the money. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but  just don't know if I will be a frequent visitor of this place... sorry!"
1/20/2018,5,"Totally love Bento (we live in Davie, Fl and usually go to that one) - tried this location and wasn't disappointed! If you don't like the wait time call ahead. Fantastic staff! We will be back next time we visit UCF!"
5/14/2018,2,This use to be one of my favorite restaurants but when you sit at your table and watch your food get cold before they deliver it to you. That really sucks.  However the hot plum tea was good
11/11/2017,2,Service was not great. Sushi came out after we finished our meals. At least 4 people came by and asked what we were waiting for. No one returned to comment or apologize.
6/21/2019,3,"They offer a wide range of noodle and rice bowls and a smaller range of sushi.  Good, not great."
2/12/2017,3,"I would avoid this location if you. Your best bet is to stop in the sand lake or downtown area. The line was out the door on a Friday night. Restaurant was super loud, which is the norm at a college restaurant. Got the usual, chicken curry katsu with noodles. When the food arrived, they gave me lo mein noodles. Not sure where the mix up was but they were able to provide me a new dish with their regular noodles. Sushi took a bit but they warned us when we ordered. 3 stars due to the long lines, mixed up on food, as well as noise. Food is still a top 4."
5/20/2015,2,I waited 38 min to get my food! The staff are nice but there were only two of them taking care of the costumes! Same story every day during lunch time. Order online if you can
3/29/2015,3,"It was ok for what it was, for the money PeiWei is better. I did come at lunch time after they just recently open so I'll give them another shot at another time."
2/25/2018,5,Best quick serve sushi place. The poke bowls are amazing and the salmon sashimi is great. Personally not a big fan of the tuna here tho. The quick serve style is super convenient for someone who doesn't want to break the bank getting sushi.
5/15/2015,4,"When I first heard bento was opening near UCF I was so thrilled! I appreciate that this one is more quick service than actual sit down restaurant because students are always on the go. It also has a bar and I believe happy hour which is awesome. When we got there the line was out the door. I ordered a roll that had salmon, tuna and cream cheese in it. It was really fresh and they didn't skimp on the fish at all. I also ordered a hot and sour soup which was really good too! I like that they are such a mix of all the Asian foods. I will for sure be going back."
7/31/2015,4,Don't order the crunch roll.  You eat rolls to be healthy but they deep fry it with a little sweet season!  So very unhealthy then they cover it with eel sauce to top the sweetness.  :(. No thanks.  Only on FL!  LOL Fat sushi!!!  Then the slices are big!  A perfect sushi is a perfect one bite.  Anything bigger just distorts your face while chewing and not good at all.  Not getting sushi here again.  I should have read the menu better.  My bad.
1/8/2018,5,This is my favorite bento location. Near ucf and the service is fast. I usually get the Mongolian beef with rice. They have some unique sushi rolls that you can try if you're into sushi.
12/26/2017,2,"I feel like every time I come here, I'm waiting for thirty minutes, minimum for my food. Currently sitting here and it's been thirty five minutes, I've order two rolls to go and everyone else around me has gotten their food. I'm not sure what it is about this place but the only reason I keep coming back is because the downtown Bento is so fast and maybe this place will get the memo. Guess not."
6/18/2019,5,The bento boxes here are great! You get several different things in them which is fun and I've never gotten one I didn't like.
5/14/2015,2,"All style, no substance. And no ramen either.I got there excited to try their ramen only to find out that this location doesn't serve it, even though it's on the menu. In the mood for a noodle soup of some sort, I settled for the spicy pork udon.The pork was super thick and overcooked, the broth tasted like sriracha water, and the dish came with nothing else but bok choy. The bento box my girlfriend got came with stir-fried noodles AND rice... but no sushi. It was a disappointment to say the least. The General Tso was as boring as anything and in no way made up for the rest of the box.If anything I would recommend the one downtown over this one just for the ramen, but there are much better places for that (Noodles and Rice on Mills Ave), so unless you're looking for a cool looking place to have some mediocre Asian food, I'd skip this one."
4/12/2015,5,"I love this place, I wish it had opened up sooner. The food is delicious and the menu is huge, full of many different options. I love asian food but the takeout places around here, haven't been very good and I have only been eating at Pei Wei and Kyoto. I finally have another place to go to and I love how close it is to UCF. 5/5 stars, you must check this place out. PS They have great boba tea."
5/1/2017,3,I work in the same plaza and during the lunch the lines are always really long. They usually only have one girl working the register and that is why. They should be properly staffed to support the clientele I mean this is the UCF area. On top of the long lines then the wait is usually long too. The food is great but with the long lines and long wait that is why I give this 3 stars.
11/20/2017,2,"I usually eat at the restaurant but I was tired and decided to pick up my order. They said it would take about 15 minutes and I arrived right on time. My food was cold, my chicken was dry, and they forgot one of my items. I would only recommend eating at the restaurant to ensure fresh and hot food."
3/30/2017,1,I honestly expected more and was really disappointed. I came before lunch rush. There were 3 other tables already eating before I arrived. Took me 20-30 minutes for my 1 sushi roll with 3 sushi chefs working........Ordered matcha boba and matcha was out of stock. Understandable so I ordered almond instead. I received regular almond tea with no boba but they got it fixed. It wasn't worth what I paid for and I got a speciality roll. I can get bigger speciality rolls from Fujiyama's on Alafaya for cheaper that will actually fill me up. I won't be back and will save my money for elsewhere.
5/23/2016,1,"This place is busy, the food is pretty good actually. Very tasty ! The service on the other hand is awful. Waiting at the bar for service when there was only two people there is ridiculous . The young man behind the bar was more interested in catching up with an old buddy in which arrived after me, ate, and cashed out before I was even checked on once to make sure everything was ok.           I was very polite in returning an order I had simply because it was a cooked item that seemed a little to undercooked on one side. He was a smart ass and asked me if it was my first time eating sushi. No honey it's not, I prefer cooked items rather than raw. Simple as that. When I looked over at him and the chef talking, the bartender was joking around and the chef was shaking his head in disappointment in which they were both looking my way.          Working in the service industry for 16 years I should know a thing or two about customer service. The manager even said she wasn't a fan about the chef when I spoke to her about my experience . I would love to come back for the food but probably won't give the chef nor the bartenders a minute of my time. So I'll find a new place."
8/21/2016,2,"Pretty disappointed with this place, both service and quality of food. Meals came out before appetizers, sushi was 20 min behind other orders, so wasn't received till everyone else was done. Food quality was basic at best. At least it's relatively cheap, but the downtown Bento's is way better - will make the drive down to there from now on."
12/23/2017,2,Been coming here for awhile. I asked for the sauce on the side and they put it all over the chicken. No big deal as they offered to remake it for me. Only problem was they let the other part of my meal sit out until they finished cooking more chicken so everything else was cold when I got the meal back.
5/10/2017,2,"I've eaten here before with no issues; their food is good though the sushi is ordinary (to be fair, I haven't tried their signature rolls).  I thought today's meal (the cream chicken rice bowl) would be rated excellently until I reached my last bite of rice and found a damn hair.  Not sure if I'll be back..."
12/10/2017,5,"Bento is my favorite place to eat, lunch or dinner. They never fail me. This location specifically. Sand lake location is a little behind, cashiers have been rude every time I have been there and try to charge extra for things i have not purchased. I always tend to sit at the bar and dine in at the UCF location, food is always amazing. Servers/bartenders are all awesome. Obsessed with the sushi! Will never get sick of it, even though i eat here at least 2-3 times a week!"
4/19/2019,3,Prices went up. Then nearby business discount removed. It's cool. Just wont come as often now.
4/17/2017,5,"Very good!!!! Food is delicious and made fresh, doesn't make you feel bloated like most Asian foods do!! Happy and will be returning"
7/10/2017,5,"I. LOVE. BENTO. They have buy one get one boba tea every tuesday, so my boyfriend and I are here every week for that. About every two weeks, we go here for lunch or dinner and they have a HUGE menu selection. Every time my family comes to Orlando, this is where they want to eat. There's something for everyone here. P.S. try their boba tea and their edamame!"
11/7/2016,4,Quick and delicious like always! I ordered the bento box with spicy cream chicken and a miso soup. The bento box is a great combination of everything and the spicy cream chicken is just delicious!
4/30/2019,5,"This place is great! The food was delicious, and the staff was helpful. The manager, Seth, was really knowledgeable and helpful. I cannot recommend this place enough."
7/8/2017,5,"Best sushi in the area for the price! I am never disappointed in what I order. I love sushi, have been eating it for about 15 years, and this place is my favorite place to go get sushi. It's one of my favorite places to take people when they come to visit. I like spicy, but some of their spicy things are like lighting your mouth on fire!"
1/25/2019,5,I love this place. Sierra works the front counter and she's amazon. So nice. So kind. So pretty. So knowledgeable about different menu items. Encouraged us to get more food for better prices. What a queen. She was just so nice to us after a long hard day at work
7/8/2016,4,"I give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the boba isn't as chewy as it should be. (Sample your competitor, Chewy) but aside from that, their Taro milk tea tastes amazing and their sushi is great quality."
9/6/2016,3,Not great. If you want something similar to sushi and you're in a hurry (but not too big of a hurry) this is the place. It tastes like it's made by someone other than a genuine sushi chef. Meh.
3/4/2017,1,"-Slow service, waited over 25 min just to get 2 rolls.-The interior is so loud when busy that you cannot hear your own thoughts.-Doesn't have a Cafe vibe, more of a loud dine-in experience.-No Wi-fi, very poor AT&T signal inside.-The sushi was okay I guess. Nothing special.-The prices are good.-The menu had good variety.I wouldn't recommend this place unless you like loud spaces and plan on spending about an hour, ordering a lot of food. Not the place to ride solo."
1/31/2019,5,"My usual orders are the make your own poke bowl, and recently I've been getting the pad thai. Both are delicious. Not the most budget friendly option in town but the environment is always extremely clean, the cashiers are kind and always offer complimentary water cups, and overall it's a good choice for good Asian cuisine."
1/16/2016,1,"Was mislead by there social media page about a deal they offered. After dealing with that for 10mins ended up ordering something else. The order taker placed the order wrong causing the food to be wrong. The sushi came out by it self, then my food, then hers. Nothing came together as it should have. Noodles were cold , taste was bland. Talked to 3 people before getting manager. The first 2 shrugged off the issue. Once my food was corrected hers was cold. Collected a refund and left. STAY AWAY or choose the McDonald's across the street."
7/9/2018,5,"Love their food. Their service is quick . Will go back again.had chicken bento box and shrimp pad Thai . They don't have enough napkins that s the only thing I have noticed which did not satisfy me, however when a waiter was asked about that she was helpful to provide us some paper napkins."
6/27/2018,1,This is the loudest place on the planet and they can't handle a lunch crowd.  15 minutes to order. waiting another 15 for my to go bag- still waiting.
1/26/2016,4,"I think the reason it is becoming so popular is because of its perfect location, right across from UCF. The service is very good, and the food is fast. I ordered a Pad Thai and remember thinking that it needed more flavor. I also ordered it extra spicy and didn't even get it medium. But I will just give it another try next time because I've gone to the one in Gainesville and the food is always surprisingly good! Also, if you check in on FB you get some sort of discount!"
11/1/2015,1,I was truly disappointed in this excuse for a cafe. I ordered the Curry Pork Katsu and the meat tasted and had the texture as if it had been frozen thawed and then frozen and thawed again. It was very rubbery. The staff had no idea of what was what. I highly recommend going somewhere else. Two thumbs down.
9/7/2018,3,"The customer service here is terrible. I went to this bento twice this week and both times were super busy, so I understand why servers would be in a bad mood. But the same person took my order both times and she doesn't even try to smile, she is obviously impatient, and is very rude. The first time I ignored her rudeness, since it was busy and I knew that I would be in a bad mood too. But the second time... if you're going to be in a bad mood every time it's busy, why don't you work somewhere that isn't as busy as Bento... Other than that, the food tastes great and the drinks are good."
9/5/2018,1,A little disappointed that it's 7:30pm the line is wrapped around the restaurant and there is only one person working the cash register. This is prime eating hours there needs to be more employees taking orders.
8/25/2018,5,"My friends and I basically go here every week. Food is amazing, i am never let down. The spring rolls are awesome"
1/11/2016,3,"Definitely amateur hour on service, but the sushi that we did eat is excellent.. The sushi was mostly tempura unfortunately, the place is for rich college students who's biggest problem is what tree to hug first makes it a little uncomfortable if you are in your early 30's."
8/10/2015,5,"I ordered pad Thai for takeout. They were super friendly on the phone, and when I got there 5 minutes later my food was already ready! Decently priced and tastes great! & the convenient location across from UCF is cherry on top of the cake!"
2/2/2016,5,"We got entree of sweet and sour shrimp, hot and sour soup and creamy spicy shrimp with white rice. Pretty delicious food. Quantity was good as well. A go to place for sushi as well. Though we didn't try sushi. Over all it's good."
7/15/2018,5,I have been obsessed from the start!!! Top two favorite things are the PAD THAI NOODLE BOWL & the MONGOLIAN. Bento's never disappoints! :)
9/25/2018,5,Delicious hot meal.  Clean restaurant and friendly service. I tried the new Pole Bowl and really enjoyed it! It was so attractive and tasty.  I would like to see more options for toppings in the future though. Their Be to box was so good! It had a lot of variety and was fun to eat and share. I am looking forward to coming back soon.
2/8/2016,5,"Amazing food! Sushi, entrees and Boba teas are all delicious. There are plenty of options to choose from and there's something for everyone to try. Tuesday's the teas are buy one get one free which is awesome. The staff is always friendly and very quick to bring your food out. I've never had any complaints! Would recommend to anyone looking for a great sushi/Japanese restaurant in the UCF area!"
6/10/2016,5,"I highly recommend trying any of the 9 Bento Cafe locations (7 current & 2 coming soon). The sushi is always fresh, there are plenty of non-sushi menu options, and everything is reasonable priced.Bento Cafe has long been one of my favorite places in Orlando to get my sushi fix. I've long been a customer at their Dr. Phillips location, recently visited their UCF area location for lunch. It is my experience that significant differences (between locations) in customer service, food quality, atmosphere, cleanliness, etc. can occur.This is NOT the case for Bento Cafe. Their UCF area location matches and (in some areas) exceeds their Dr. Phillips location. The service was incredibly friendly, helpful, and timely (despite the large crowds). The food was excellent per usual. I got a spicy tuna roll, cucumber roll, and tofu pad Thai noodle bowl. Both rolls (8 pieces each) were more than filling. The noodle bowl ended up going home with me for dinner. The 2 rolls and noodle bowl ended up costing around $20, which is incredibly reasonable."
1/20/2016,1,"I ordered a stir-fry dish and their most popular sushi roll, Gucci. It was awful. It didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go there nor would I recommend it to anyone.If you do choose to go avoid sitting in the back next to the fountain drink area. It smells like wet carpet"
8/19/2015,3,"I wouldn't go as far as saying the food here is awesome, but Bento Cafe does serve decent Asian Fusion cuisine. Despite being quite large and spacious, seating can be limited during the busiest lunch hours, so you might spend a few minutes hunting down a table. The food comes out quickly, and there's a lot to choose from. I've only had the bento boxes, which came with a lot of food for around $10."
5/4/2015,5,"I love this place! I highly recommend the Spicy Cream Chicken, it's excellent. The new UCF location is also very nice and definitely a lot nicer and faster than the other locations in Orlando."
8/28/2015,4,Came with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Got the General Tso chicken bowl and enjoyed the crispy chicken and dark sauce. (Usually redder from other places) only reason not full five stars is because the smaller pieces were more batter than chicken. (Still tasty though :/)
2/28/2018,3,"Very expensive for what you get, and it feels like you pay for normal side items like soup or salad. The boba tea mix selection is nice, and you can buy ramune but other than that not worth it."
8/2/2015,3,"Honestly this is a great place for quick sushi after class when you're too lazy to drive further out for better quality sushi. That's pretty much it. The sushi is definitely nothing great, but its not bad. I dislike the amount of eel sauce they feel the need to pour over most of the sushi rolls so I usually opt out on that. Overall its a great quick fix for cravings, but nothing else. I find it a bit overpriced for the amount of sushi you receive. If you really want your bang for your buck just don't be lazy like me and drive the extra distance.Their boba teas are good except the boba balls need work. Boba balls are supposed to be chewy and not hard. I can tell they haven't mastered their boba balls yet."
1/5/2017,1,"i usually love bento. i visit there once a week but today i went in for an early dinner and a roach crawled across my table. i got up and told one of the cashiers and all she said was ""sorry"" didn't get a manager or do anything about the bug that just ran across my table. not sure if i will ever go back. just went to bento for a second time to see if they could redeem themselves....NOPE there was a bug in my soy sauce."
4/17/2016,4,The asian cuisine here is pretty good. I eat here once every week or so. I'm just getting into sushi and I found there entrees to be pretty good. I definitely recommend giving there spicy creme rice bowl a try.
12/16/2015,5,Samantha was excellent we will definitely be back wonderful person and the food was to die for expecially for the price
8/2/2015,5,"The name says it all, you have to get a bento box when you come here. I always order the spicy cream chicken bento box and I will never get sick of it. The chicken has so much sauce in it and very flavorful. The green beans they give you is delicious. Then they give you white rice and lo mein noodles and they're the same as a regular chinese restaurant. I would recommend going here, its fast and a new look on chinese food"
11/15/2017,5,"I came to Bento for some sushi and sat at the bar. The sushi came out quick and was fantastic. The bartender, I think his name was Fasley, was attractive and charismatic and made sure our experience was perfect. He recommended sake drinks and they were great, I only wish he could have drank them with us. 10/10 returning again"
6/18/2015,5,I have never had sushi before today and it was an amazing experience. I am an extremely picky eater and I asked if I could have chicken tempura roll but just chicken and rice so the cashier asked the manager and he said yes that it could be wrapped in rice paper and the manager had heard that I'd never had sushi before. He asked if I wanted to try anything else and I said I was skeptical. As I'm waiting for my chicken tempura roll I received a shrimp tempura roll on the house just because he wanted me to try it. It was DELICIOUS! Incredible customer service and incredible food. Thank you Bento!
3/31/2015,5,"I go to the one in Downtown and Sand Lake all the time and tried this one out while I was in the area.  Awesome!!! I like the new additions/changes to their current dishes.  The appearance is great, roomy and has a fresh look! The staff is great and courteous as like the other locations.  Def. recommend the Spicy Creme!"
4/26/2017,1,I was really unimpressed with my food and who charges you a $1 for extra sides of Siracha? I mean mom and pop restaurants don't even do that . Not worth the price
4/21/2015,5,"When it's busy it can be frustrating waiting to order your meal, other then that this place is the bomb... Great sushi & stir fry... If you are into spicy go for the Cajun chicken stir-fry Bento Box... You wont be disappointed. Also portion sizes are perfect, I either leave stuffed or with a doggy bag. Awesome Place!!!"
7/27/2015,3,I was really excited to see that a Bento Cafe was opening up closer to where I live since I had been to the downtown location a few times and really enjoyed it. Good food and good atmosphere. It can get pretty busy and the few times I have gone the line was out the door but it moves along fast enough. I am pretty disappointed by how much they reduced their vegetarian options compared to the downtown location though.
10/14/2016,5,Always have a pleasant experience.. Food is always fresh and prepared correctly! Love the combo of both menus
4/3/2015,5,"I've been to the other Bento locations (Gainesville, Downtown, Sand Lake) and this another gem.  Yes, the line can appear long, but it moves very quickly.   I had lunch with 6 friends today and we had no complaints.  Service was great, especially considering they have only been open 2 weeks.   We all did different meals, and I got my tried and true - Spicy Tuna Don.  All delish!I'm so glad Bento is just around the corner!"
2/28/2017,2,The service is good but the food has gotten kinda bad honestly. You'd be better off finding a more authentic sushi place to eat at.
8/21/2016,3,"I ordered the udon noodle chicken bowl. Some chicken prices dried out, veggies fresh but overall dish wasn't inspired. When giving your order tell them you want mild, medium or hot as the Sriracha bottle was almost empty as it gave the dish some needed flavor. It's fast casual."
10/2/2015,3,"Ordered delivery through doorstep. The food I got wasn't bad, just bland. Not impressed. Also didn't get any soy sauce or utensils with my order which obviously sucks and made eating it difficult. I also got fried dumplings and was also disappointing, the flavor was ok but the the outside was unlike any asian dumpling I've ever had. It was thick and reminded me more of an empanada. Don't know if I'll try this place again."
4/27/2016,1,"So the service at this Bento is terrible. This isn't the first time I've had an issue with Bento UCF, but literally every time I go in, there's something. This time I was there to pick up an order, which should have been under 5 minutes because the restaurant was dead. But I waiting at the bar and I notice there's another woman waiting, and I no one is at the bar attending people. I notice this girl bagging food, immediately i know its her who's supposed to be taking care of the bar area, she looks towards the bar, and the phone rings (I'm assuming to call in an order) she takes the call. Whatever, so a good couple of minutes pass and me and this lady are glancing back and forth at each other. I finally walk up to the regular counter and ask if anyone can check out at the bar. Instead of helping this girl was like ""Yeah she'll be there in a minute""  So I walk back over to the bar and then the girl who was on the phone came back to the bar and then checks me out before the other woman, which throws me off even more. I was waiting there for like 10 minutes, who knows how long this lady was sitting there. But clearly terrible pick up service, which sucks because its close to UCF but the Downtown location is 100x better.On other occasions, I've called in and the phone rings for like 6+ minutes. One time I went in and I was trying to order spring rolls and this guy tried to tell me they only had egg rolls. He was going back and forth with me and then I had to point it out on the menu for his to put my order in.The food is good, the service is terrible"
5/26/2015,4,"Udon! All you need to know. Really fresh, nice option for ""fast"" sushi. Much needed in the area."
2/11/2016,1,"Ugh!  If I could leave zero starts I would.  Ordered a make your own bowl with tuna, salmon and steamed shrimp.  One bite of the Tuna - so gross.  I hate to be crass- but it was like a mouthful of snot- so completely slimy.  I have never in my life tasted such a vile piece of tuna.  That sorta' ended lunch.  I had to spi9t it out and go rinse my mouth out of the slime.  I found it interesting that a couple of ""attentive"" staff walked by and asked how it was going (in a fly-by sort of way- so no chance of actually mentioning what was wrong)- none seemed to notice the full bowl of food.  When a girl came to clear the table, I did mention my lunch was not so hot.  She replied, ""Oh- the make your own"" - like it was my fault for picking  bad combo or something.  I let her know it was not the ""flavors""- but the gnarly tuna.  ""Oh- I'll let them know in the kitchen.""    Thanks.  $12 dollars gone and no lunch- I drove elsewhere and grabbed lunch somewhere more consistent.  It's been a few hours and I'm starting to  feel a little nauseous-  pray for me."
12/21/2015,1,"This is actually my first review. I made an account specifically to leave this review. Normally when I see people slam restaurants on yelp, I think to myself, ""How do you care this much? Just don't go there."" In this instance, however, I feel like it's a health hazard if I don't, so here goes.Bento claims to have gluten-free options. This is a pretty big deal to me since I'm super allergic (diagnosed by a doctor) and it isn't always easy to find gluten-free options when eating out. Just describing my reaction to gluten would break the review guidelines, so just trust me when I say that it is both disgusting and painful. Unfortunately, while Bento technically has gluten-free options, big chunks of breading magically found their way into my food 5 times out of 7 visits (they kept saying it wouldn't happen again, and I guess I'm gullible so I kept trying). On one instance, I didn't just specify that I needed a gluten-free meal, but I told the cashier that last time I accidentally got breading in my food that made me very sick, and my meal STILL ended up with breading in it! At this point it almost seems like they're doing it on purpose.  I've never been offered any sort of compensation other than a replacement meal, which is wildly inconvenient since I'm usually in a hurry and I get take-out and don't discover the breading till I get home. The last time it happened, a lower manager told me that I should check my food before leaving the restaurant, which is clearly true. However, shouldn't the kitchen staff check the food before it goes out? She really was just trying to be helpful, but is not getting what I ordered really MY fault? Either way, the breading gets all mixed into the sauce, so often I don't find it until I crunch into a piece, and by then it's too late. There is clearly some sort of a problem in the kitchen that needs to be fixed. Keeping breading out of unbreaded food really should not be this complicated.The final time that it happened I was promised a call from upper management addressing the issue but it never came, so I assume they never addressed it.All in all, the one-star rating isn't because the food is bad. I like the food. I went there seven times for goodness sake! Even those toxic pieces of breading are delicious, they just make me really really sick. I just want to warn others with dietary restrictions that Bento will not take it seriously, no matter how much you beg. I know I've learned my lesson."
2/2/2016,2,Lunch rush line was 15 minutes.  Food took an extra long time to be delivered.  Both entrees arrived incorrectly. Which took even longer.  My least favorite Of the three restaurants in the area.
2/4/2016,1,"This is my second attempt to email the corporate office. On February 4, 2016, I placed a to go order at the Bento near UCF in Orlando. Per my recipe, I ordered a 4 pc Caliente roll and a lean mean from an April B. When the food arrived back to my office, I realized my order was wrong. We could not back it back to Bento due to work obligations; therefore, I decided to call. A young man that didn't give his name took my call and I explain to him that my to-go was incorrect. He asked if I wanted a ""store credit or something."" I said I expected something due to the error. He asked what my original order and told me he would talk to the manager after he had already placed me on hold to assist another customer. He left the phone and came back shortly after and asked had I received the 4 pc Caliente. I said I had. He then informed me that the Lean Mean had been discontinued, so the order for the lean green was placed instead. I asked why hadn't the young lady told me that; he said he didn't know because he didn't take my order and I wasn't his customer. He also said ""oh well, there's nothing we can do about it now."" After $15 at this establishment and another $10 at another establishment for more viable lunch, yes there is something that needs to be done about this. I visit this Bento weekly and we discontinue patronage until I receive some sort of refund for this mistake on April B and the entire staff at Bento for this error on them. Not informing a customer, that has an allergy to cucumber, that an option had been discontinued and replacing it with roll that was full of cucumber is unacceptable. It would have been a lawsuit had I even ate it because of my allergy. This behavior is unacceptable and your employees should be better informed about the menu options so that mistakes like these don't happen again."
6/29/2016,3,"Eh. That's all I have to say for this place. Speaking on behalf of my experience (first time) here, I have to admit, I had higher expectations for this place. When you first walk in, on your right are two menus, the kitchen menu and the sushi menu. I didn't even know that was there until some customers ahead of us had to reach over and grab it. Second, the menu was confusing. I think the TVs displaying of the food was a better glimpse of what they have to offer than reading the menu itself. Did I forget to mention they ran out of the kitchen menus? I had to grab one at the front and make my decision quick for the many people standing behind me, waiting, menu-less. Now the food was ok. It wasn't that good. I ordered the shrimp tempura noodle soup and my friend ordered the pork chop noodle soup. When it arrived, it was just plain old broth and udon noodles. There was barely any pork chop and the shrimp tempura was on the side. For such quality of a soup, it wasn't worth the $8 or $9 a bowl. I also ordered a milk tea but it tasted like syrup and milk. This place is alright. I guess I should've ordered the bento box... if the menu was actually legible. Wouldn't come back unless there were specials."
10/6/2022,5,"This food was delightful. I was not expecting it to be so good considering it's a fast food spot. I had their yellow curry and I was impressed! I like the variety of veggies ,the chicken was tender and the curry itself had great flavor."
12/19/2022,2,"We used to love coming here, we came nearly once a week because the food was so good. We always referred to it as "" a better Panda Express"".. however, around covid, they had a price increase, and they priced us out. Haven't been since. I miss it but I can't fathom paying their current prices. I would love some sort of special at least."
10/1/2022,5,Wow!. The hate is real for this place. I love how fast their takeout service is and I appreciate the ambience of the restaurant. It is located in a lovely mall and the decor and the design of the restaurant are both wonderful.
12/11/2021,5,"My daughter introduced me to Bento's. One night I felt for some sushi and we ordered a bunch to test them out and ever since I've been hooked. They are a little on the pricey side but it's worth it. Yesterday, my husband and I dined in and our experience was great. Great service and great food."
10/6/2022,2,"Decent food, but the wait was terrible.  I didn't get the carry out food for 45 minutes after the time they said the food would be ready.  The food itself was fine, but an overall 60 minute wait just isn't worth it."
1/2/2022,4,"I absolutely love poke bowls, so I was so excited to come here! I ordered on my phone and walked over to pick it up.  They are very particular about masks here. I don't really care either way, but they are the only place in Sunset Walk that asks you to wear them, so it's not expected.  I'd have ordered from here sooner if it wasn't for that, so be prepared with a mask.I got a tofu poke bowl,  orange tofu and taro milk tea, and shared with my husband. Taro is purple when I get it at home, so I was surprised this wasn't.  It was fine though.  The orange tofu was pretty much just like ordering Chinese food. It was good, but my husband ate most of that, which was fine The poke bowl was really what I wanted.  I absolutely love spicy mayo! I liked that you could add pineapple and mango. And I got fried tofu and spicy tofu, which was nice. It was pretty good, but I really prefer the bowls I get near me at home. And this one cost more than I usually pay for $14. However, if I went back,  I'd definitely get it again. It's also a nice healthier option on Sunset Walk.  And I like that they had other food options here, too, so my husband can get something he likes. There were several things here that I wanted to try, so I'd definitely go back again."
2/8/2022,4,"I love Bento and it's great to see them continue to grow to new locations. I have done takeout from this location several times and have dined in. They have a few tables and chairs outside and the Promenade is dog friendly, so I've been able to sit outside with my dog.Online ordering is available and what I usually do so I can just roll in, grab and go."
10/10/2021,2,"This restaurant is located in a nice complex.Bento is for you eat quick food, that's it.Pad Thai isn't good. And the poke you can create your own, good option for health meal."
5/17/2021,5,"After a long day at Magic Kingdom, my friends and I decided to pickup Bento for dinner since it was literally down the street from our cottage. The ordering process was easy via the website. My expectations were quite low for the mini poke bowl with teriyaki beef that I ordered.I was actually very surprised at the portion of the mini. It's very generous with the amount of protein, brown rice, and add-on's. The yuzu shoyu was on the side so my food didn't get soggy during transport. The avocado, onions, edamame, and mangoes were all fresh and went well with the yuzu shoyu. Teriyaki beef was tender, juicy, and flavorful too. It's crazy but I think Bento might taste better than most of the poke joints in LA. I really enjoyed my food!"
9/25/2022,1,"Oh! How the mighty have fallen! We used to love Bento so much. To the point where we would drive through horrible Friday night traffic on 192 just to get some. But their service and food quality have been tanking lately. Most recent example was their ""20 Anniversary Promotion"" where they offer a free classic roll with a $20 purchase. We attempted to use the code provided online and it failed! No worries we said, the coupon can be used in store. When my wife arrived, the team refused to help her and said to just keep trying online. She's 9 months pregnant and they turned her away. I don't normally blast a business for their disgusting service, but you bet I will go to every social media venue to make this known. I just hope their incoming Flamingo Crossings location doesn't get tainted by this awful crew."
10/4/2022,2,"Used to come here on a weekly basis. But they started consistently messing up our orders. Add on were noticeably smaller or just forgotten completely, even when i ordered extra sauce (paid for it) it would be forgotten. Don't waste your money, foods good but not worth it anymore"
6/30/2022,5,"Food was on point! You can tell the pride put into the food! Yellow curry was spot on!! Perfect spice, veggies used were amazing!! Not just thrown together! Kids loved the chicken teriyaki box. Just wished the rice serving was a bit more! Ordered food through Uber, love the bento box containers! Loved that bite of cinnamon wonton for desert!"
9/26/2021,4,"The food was good, considering I was literally 10 feet away not understanding why my sushi was in such disarray, sloppily prepared. The noodles were great I got tempura string beans which were also great, the curry chicken was delicious and mildly spicy. All in all everything was good."
3/7/2022,4,Not a bad place It's just a bit price. $15 for one roll plus included gratuity minimum 15%. Very taste!! Loved it!!
7/2/2021,4,"I just finished eating here for my second time and it was very good!Food- I got the Orange Tofu Bento Box with white rice, lo mien, cinnamon strips, green beans, and ginger salad. All of my good was incredible. My only complaint would be was my tofu was very big and chewy, but the tofu also had a very nice crunch to it.Service- Service was good. My food got out in a timely manner and had no issues. You order up at the counter. Atmosphere- The atmosphere was good.Bathrooms- Very nice and clean. They only have two unisex single bathrooms. Overall- 89/100 (Highly Recommend)"
9/20/2020,4,"First time trying Bento. They have an easy to use website so I ordered online. Bonus points for making it easy for me! They also have an app but I'm old school/just old and like a real keyboard. Mini poke bowl with tempura shrimp,  mango, asparagus,  green beans and carrots.  Tempura was good,  but we'll probably try steamed shrimp for another take out order.Egg fried rice had lots of scallions on top even though I had requested no scallions but was easily scraped off. So no big deal. Good, basic fried rice.Kid's teriyaki chicken was Mike's favorite.  Really nice grilled chicken and he liked the green beans, also.Pad Thai was nicely prepared and they omitted the peppers and scallions as requested. Thanks so much! Greatly appreciated.  Shrimp was a nice size and nicely cooked. I forgot to request a low spice level, so the dish was kinda spicy for us. I tried adding some lime juice and some of the sweeter sauce but still kinda spicy. Next time I'll remember to request low spice.The Krab rangoon/wonton was nice but probably would be better in house rather than to-go.I was pleasantly surprised by the steamed pork dumplings. Will definitely get these next time."
6/15/2022,5,"Always on point for a quick, quality sushi meal. Clean establishment with friendly employees."
7/10/2022,5,Came with a party of six and everyone tried something different. Everything was equally delicious from the sushi to the bowls to the boxes. Will definitely mark this place as one to return to the next time we're in Orlando. I'd post a picture but the food didn't last long once it hit the table.
1/19/2022,5,Food is actually hella good despite some of the reviews and the employees were all extremely nice!  we're from vegas and tbh this is the nicest treatment we've had here in Orlando
2/1/2022,4,"Bento is a solid choice anytime for tasty stir fries, poke bowls and sushi.  I regularly visit for boba tea and poke bowls with tons of customizable options. On today's visit there was a wait to receive my food as the kitchen was backed up - and this has been consistent for a bit.  My biggest suggestion is to order early - then you'll have less of a wait in the restaurant.  Use the mobile app!"
7/4/2022,3,"This place is SO slow - it's took over 30 minutes to get 3 rolla. I ordered in advance, showed up at the time it was supposed to be ready and I've been waiting for my order. I can't even rate the food because it's not ready. Won't be coming back."
7/27/2021,5,The fast food version of Asian food.A lot of choices and options for your needs and wants!The staff are friendly and helpful! I love their food And bonus is the decor is modern and cool!
6/24/2020,4,"Better than your average fast casual Asian spot. Bentos is conventiently located in the Sunset Walk plaza of the Margaritaville Resort area and Island H2O water park. This plaza is great for tourists and locals alike to shop and dine. Bentos offers some fast casual pan-asian flavors via noodle or rice bowl, sushi, poke and boba tea!The set up may remind you of other fast food style asian eateries, but what i love about Bentos is their various flavors on their menu. You can get Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean flavors fused with American influence. I usually shy away from places that have too much on the menu but they execute very well. Their bowls are where it's at! You have various choices for a base (white or brown rice, and 3 kinds of noodles).  Great choices for protein (chicken, tofu, steak, shrimp, veggies) and all kinds of sauces. My favorite being Pao pao sauce. It reminds me of the honey walnut shrimp at chinese restaurants or the ""white sauce"" from Japanese tepanyaki places. Their sushi choices are also pretty good for a fast casual place.  Definitely above average.This Florida-grown company is developing steadily with locations centered around college campuses, but so glad they popped one up closer to where I live. The staff are all friendly and while we are in COVID, maintain their use of masks, social distancing, and lots of visible cleaning.  Their to-go game is also strong.  Love supporting this home grown business.  Keep it up!"
3/5/2021,4,"From the first time I tried Bento up in Gainesville to now, I have loved their variety and reasonable prices. They are also pretty consistent in their food quality, regardless of what location you go to and what city you are in. This is a fairly new Bento location and I love how modern and sleek it looks, with the large glass windows and modern, hip interior. I got what I got most of the time: Spicy Cream Chicken Rice Bowl. I love how the chicken has a good breading on it, but not too thick. Just enough to soak up the creamy and slightly spicy sauce. Paired with the crunch of the green beans and the fluffy rice, this is a go to order here. But be warned, food coma comes quickly with this dish. Best have the coffee ready or you'll find yourself napping afterwards lol."
4/8/2020,4,"If you love sushi or are new to it, this is a great place to try out different flavors for a low price. My favorite is the sushi combo. It includes an 8 piece California Roll and two 4 piece specialty rolls of your choice. I always get the Special Mexican and then I vary on the other roll. The combo also comes with soba noodles and a small side salad all for about $10.The set up is quick/table service. You order at the counter then they give you a number and they bring it to you when it's ready. You can also order ahead for pick up or delivery. They aren't just known for their sushi but also their namesake, Bento boxes. They have such a great selection and can satisfy the most picky eaters. My mom loves their pineapple fried rice and teriyaki chicken. They also offer delicious boba teas.Stop in and give them a try!"
2/27/2021,5,"We ordered the combo box with the California roll, Japanese Bagel, and Fried Avocado. We had it delivered and it took about an hour (normal) and was DELICIOUS!"
3/20/2022,2,"Stood in line for 5 minutes while an off the clock employee chatted it up with the cashier, while there was a line. Not even the worst part, they were bad mouthing a table sitting inside in front of customers. Also took over 20 minutes for two sushi rolls while they weren't busy in the middle of a Sunday afternoon. The food is decent here but don't think I'll be back because of the customer service. They all seem like their customers are an inconvenience to them and their social lives. Plus no warm welcome or thank you while ordering. Then once some of them were off they took up tables and just continued their conversations in the dining room. I hope management sees this to fix the issues. I've worked in food service for almost 15 years and have managed for a long time. This is just ridiculous."
5/16/2020,4,"We have ordered from Bento many many times and with the pandemic, we have been doing takeout. This time when I saw my sushi bento box, I was pleasantly surprised. It was presented so nicely! Side notes about the cafe:I don't think Bento has the best tasting or most creative rolls. I continue to keep going because their poke bowls and rice bowls (especially the Pao Pao Sweet Cream Chicken) are their shining stars. And I like their Milk Teas. I will say their customer service could use some help at this location; not the friendliest or reactive (the Dr Phillips staff are much better- went there for over 5 years and then moved out to Davenport). When ordering from a mobile service, they seem to avoid that area and the wait time is longer than if you were to just order from the standard line. It's also an awkward location because it's at the end of the standard line (their exit) so if you're waiting to be noticed, you have to keep moving out of the way so the standard line can exit. Overall, I do enjoy Bento."
2/26/2022,5,"A delicious fresh surprise :) we ordered hibachi and sushi and everything was really good, we loved it and will be back!"
12/11/2019,4,"A very welcome addition to the area!!  Since discovering Poke bowls a few years ago, I would drive quite a distance to get one should the craving arise, now I can get my Poke bowls on my way home from work.They offer a very decent variety of options and sizes, and they're priced reasonably.  The flavor and freshness is outstanding!  Of course they offer many other options besides Poke Bowls, like sushi, and chicken dishes.  Service is not always fast, but friendly, and the dishes are well worth the wait."
3/15/2022,2,Store was busy.  Customer service was limited and short.  Order food to go waited over 30 minutes for 1 Bento box and 2   .  What was messed up was people who order after me got orders before I did because they were eating in restaurant.  Food was room temperature when I got home.  Will not be going back.  By the way I am a local in the area.  They also don't take cash her customer left upset.
7/25/2021,3,"Needed somewhere quick to eat after a day at Disney. Their menu looked vegan friendly, but when I called to confirm they said everything had dairy, so disappointed their tofu and veggie options weren't vegan, most places that let you build your own are perfect for vegans. My kids had their kids meal though and enjoyed their food. Hopefully they can increase their vegan options."
11/30/2020,5,"We've been ordering delivery from here a lot recently thru UberEats since COVID. Their food has been very good and they do a good job at paying attention to food modifications. My only complaint about this location is that they are hit or miss when it comes to following requests for things like a side of sauce or soy sauce packets. I've eaten at 2 other bentos and this has never been an issue, and generally the rule is with each roll you get a free side of sauce. However, when I order from this location, sometimes they'll give me the sauce I request and the soy sauce and other times they won't. Or they'll just give 3 soy sauce packets for 2-4 rolls, which is not nearly enough. Otherwise, this is a good location and the food is always really good."
8/27/2022,1,I always come to bento to get the Korean or sushi or whatever I feel like I want and I have  had a poke bowl before I don't know if todays wasn't it or everyone just wanted to go home we'll the dude with glasses specifically rushing my order but there poke bowl was completely shit today no offense there food is alright but the poke so no noey and there rice they douse it in the sauce sometimes if u get a bowl
12/8/2019,5,"Wow, this place is delicious and inexpensive! My fiancé and I were looking for a quick place to eat at while we were on vacation. We weren't really in the mood for amusement park food so we were glad we found this place. This place is super close to WDW.We got the chicken pad thai and Korean bulgogi rice bowl. My pad thai was good but not the best I've ever had. I felt that it was missing its lime tanginess that I'm a fan of. My fiancé's bulgogi bowl was delicious though! Both bowls also had a generous portion of protein."
7/30/2021,5,"We love this spot whenever we are in the mood for quick Asian food. I always order their chicken teriyaki over white rice. I love how even though the meal does not seem like a lot, it's actually very filling and I love how fresh the food is. Their Boba teas are also very delicious, I would highly recommend this place."
10/30/2020,4,"Pros: 1) good is good, most of the time fresh; 2) price is ok; 3) has an outdoor seats; 4) lunch specialsCons: 1) paying system"
3/15/2021,1,"Here's an update:Owner reaches out to me and replies to my review offering to try and make things right. Gives me an Email to follow up. I've sent two emails to the email given and no one has responded back to me. So make it up to me by wasting my time writing emails to get no response? Looks like the issues start at the top hopefully it's only this location, what a shame."
2/5/2020,5,"Really nice restaurant that offers fresh healthier options for the entire family.  The prices are reasonable, food is prepared fresh and staff is friendly and attentive.This was my first time at this location and the entire area is very nice and tucked away near Margharittaville.As a local, I'm glad I stopped in. We tried a Bento box with red dragon, tex mex and of course their Cali rolls.  Yum!We also had a lo main bowl sriracha garlic bowl with shrimp... omg delish.  Yes, it has a hint of spice.   Well worth it.  Honestly, it's a ton of food and you can share.The restaurant is well decorated and restrooms are very clean!  Will definitely be back!Oh,  they have deals on Tuesdays."
8/10/2022,1,So it just seems like they threw random things in my bowl it's missing half of the items I purchased and it's all edamame which I don't order because its texture ruins the eating experience.
9/21/2021,4,"Pretty decent food. Just one sushi roll is enough for me as they a very large.Its a bit of a fast food place, as you have to queue to pay, and then wait for the food. would be a lot better if they just put some service people in there."
2/23/2022,4,Food came out in a timely manor even though the place was packed. Nice and hot food at a good quality. I would definitely recommend the Katsu Pork with Pao Pao Sauce!
1/3/2022,1,", Ridiculous bad service. Waited 20 minutes for pick up   Asked for it at counter and then found out it was in the shelf waiting. Server didn't care if we ate cold or not."
6/1/2019,5,"This new Bento location is perfect! The menu is very similar to the other locations, the food is just as good, and the staff was very welcoming and friendly for the new folks that had never been before. I always get the sushi, so I branched out to try the Bento box today and I was very excited to get it.  First, the salad was great - the dressing was perfect; a perfect amount for the size.  Next, you can choose between brown and white rice; my rice was done excellently and was just enough to eat with my main course. The beef was excellent, it was a little spicy, just as advertised. But, I don't think it was spicy enough to make problems for most people. The best part of the Bento are the little dessert fried pieces.  That is just enough at the end of the meal to leave a sweet flavor in your mouth.I'm very excited to go back and try some new combos."
1/24/2022,1,Let me start by saying I have been to numerous Bentos before and I absolutely love them as a whole.  I ordered a poke bowl via Uber Eats.  Not only did it take an hour and a half to get it (I live 4 miles away) but the order was wrong!  I called the restaurant to let them know it wasn't correct and they told me it was Uber Eats' fault and there was nothing they could do.  It was not the Uber drivers fault because Bento made the order incorrectly.  Will not be going to this particular Bento ever again.
7/19/2020,4,"Went one day to see what it was.  Ended up really enjoying a Poke Bowl...you get to pick out all the ingredients.  Went back again during one of the neighborhood's car shows.  Not sure if it's totally fair to judge them during Covid-19, but they really didn't seem to know how to handle the extra crowds."
5/22/2021,1,Has to be the worst customer service! Got a drink that tasted gross and asked if we could switch it out for just a fountain drink the girl charged us again for a fountain drink! Sushi was not good!!!! Had like to pieces each and left the rest! Will not be coming back.
10/18/2021,5,"One of our favorite spots! Often get the build your own poke, pao pao chicken, mex roll, and Thai boba tea! We go at least 3 times a month"
1/26/2021,4,"Bento is one of my weekly lunch stops. I usually order the white rice with Teriyaki Chicken. Then I smother the rice and chicken with white sauce. The sauce is so good and the reason I come back so often. The Krab Wontons  are must order side, they always come out super fresh! Right now due to covid this location does have inside dining, however their fountain machine is turned off so there are no free refills. Cokes are sold in individual cans. Water bottles are available for purchase for $.25 since free water is not currently available."
11/14/2021,5,Love everything here and they are super consistent ! They have many great choices . We eat here regularly and it never disappoints
2/23/2020,3,"The place Well let's say by far the wait for my food took for ever not kool.  The place looks well kept, it's an upscale Panda Express. Service My wife had spicy steak with rice and I had sesame chicken with rice.  We ordered at the same time.  Her food came out about 15 min after we ordered which is about normal.  This is where it gets interesting, my food came out about 20 min after her food.  LOL we ordered at the same time ( unbelievable ).  Only two guesses would come to mind. 1 they forgot to order my food or they gave my food to someone else.  FoodWell presented and good taste, wide variety to choose from sushi to lo mein. OverallIf it wasn't for the extreme wait,  I would've given an extra star.  Would I ever go back?  If I'm in the area and want Asian food then probably but I wouldn't drive 30 min again for a 30 min wait"
2/21/2021,1,"We ordered 4 menu items from this location through Uber eats. Firstly they messed my main entree and send a sesame stir fry instead of the garlic sriracha that is ordered. Secondly and most importantly none of the 4 boxes had any kind of safety seal or sticker securing my food. Even the main paper bag didn't have any kind of tape or stapler on it so I could be assured that my food was delivered safely through the Uber eats driver! In these concerning times atleast the restaurant employees or management should adhere to safety measures. Upon calling the restaurant, the manager on duty Christopher was so RUDE and plainly asked me to contact Uber eats directly and nothing they can do to resolve the issue, neither remake nor refund. I hope the OWNER Nate makes an effort to contact me and resolve this because I'm highly disappointed with the service of this location."
3/21/2021,1,"We ordered through DoorDash asking for certain things to be removed so my vegetarian daughter could eat. Over an hour later the food arrives and the meat hadn't been removed. I could see clearly that my receipt showed the order correctly,  it it was transposed wrong when putting it in their order system. I called and spoke the manager who would offer nothing. He just told me I had to call DoorDash to fix it. I emailed corporate and still have not received even a basic apology. I called DoorDash who also offered no reprieve, and escalating to their management I still have heard no word. This company obviously could care less about poor service, and would prefer to take your money and leave your family hungry. I don't recommend them."
2/23/2020,4,"Went out with my husband for dinner and decided to stop here. Great tasting, high-quality food with many ways to customize, a fancy Panda Express I'll say. My order came out normal time, but my husband's order took long.  He and I stood waiting for a least 20 minutes or more.  The server finally bought my husband's food out with no explanations or apology.  No Bueno!  I waited to eat until his food came out, finally when it did my food was not as hot.  I admit the food was delicious; I had the Spicy Bulgogi with a steam rice bowl and my husband had the Sesame Stir Fry chicken with steam rice bowl. Besides the wait time, we were delighted with food tasting. I think we will return. Hopefully, food comes out at the same time."
1/8/2021,4,"So glad to have another location of this restaurant!  My partner and I still enjoy coming here and enjoying the bento boxes as well as sushi. Things have changed a few times due to COVID, but the changes have been clearly communicated through signage as well as emails for existing customers who sign up (not too frequent either). We've not been disappointed in the quality nor freshness of anything we've ordered, whether for in house or to go. Precautions taken by this restaurant are such that they clearly are doing everything they can to keep the community as well as their employees safe and allow the location to remain open."
2/1/2020,4,"Bento is basically a quick service sushi and Asian food spot. I tend to always get sushi or poke bowls here. For $11 you can get a sushi combo box with a full California roll and then your choice of 4 pieces of two other rolls. So if you are like me and can't decide on one, this is the perfect option. It may not be the best sushi I have ever had but if you have a craving it gets the job done.This location also seems to be a bit quicker from ordering to actually receiving your food then other Bento locations I have been to. My only compliant is when they are busy the line gets long and basically goes through the middle of the restaurant so it can be a difficult to navigate around if your looking for a seat inside.If you are looking for a quick bite in the area though, this is a good spot to try."
5/11/2022,2,"First thing we noticed when ordering is the girl taking our order has no customer service skills, pretty sure she was being trained but still it's kind of common sense to not have customer service skills she had a little attitude and made weird faces at us when ordering, then while we were paying the girl training her told us ""oh by the way it's 25 min wait for sushi"" like that's could have told us that before so we could go somewhere else but whatever. Then when the food came it wasn't even that good I think the best thing was the miso soup. There was one girl that was super sweet tho out of everyone we talked to she had red hush curly hair. Overall just feels like teenagers running a place"
3/17/2021,5,Saturday afternoon meal with two boxes of goodness in Covid times. Beef Mongolian and Szechuan chicken were our choices that really hit the spot. The fresh veg and tasty sauces were brag worthy. The service was weird to order at the counter.
8/3/2021,1,Stay away. Food sucks.  Chicken old and rubbery service nothing to write home about. Never to return
2/13/2021,1,"Just had the misfortune of picking up food at this location. The poor kitchen and runner staff are working their butts off while the shift leader is standing over at the computer doing..... heaven knows what!!! She did not walk over and help those poor souls once. But what raised my blood pressure the most was not only didn't she make contact with anyone coming to the pick up unless they waited for her precious attention but when a guy came over to pick up and one she didn't acknowledge him so when he said excuse me, she raised her finger in the ..... wait position.... and walked away from him and acknowledged him when she returned, that did it for me. When I finally got my now cold food, I asked for the managers name I was told by her I can't give you the name but I can give you the corporates email. Wrote it down. I advised her I wanted her to write it down.... wow, just wow! We will never return there."
7/22/2021,4,"The food is very good.  The flavors were not very strong, probably needed a bit of salt.  It tasted fresh.  Since it was made to order, it was good.  This reminds me of Pai Wei.  When we arrived for lunch, there were a bunch of tables that were not cleaned up yet but that got taken care of after we ordered.  The service was fine"
9/20/2019,5,"Ive been to Bento twice in my life. This being the second time. I LOVE IT. Came to lunch with my coworker,  got bento boxes, a sushi roll, and yummy crab wontons.I had forgetten how BIG the portions are here. Totally worth every penny. Everything tastes good. Im not a noodle person and wanted more noodles! The pao pao chicken is delish. Not spicy at all. I am not a spicy eater, so I would know. The sushi roll couldve used a little more cream cheese but it was good. And the crab wontons- o.m.g. my favorites.This location is about 5 minutes from my job so I am very excited to come back for more yumminess!!"
8/27/2019,3,"Yay! We love Bento. The new locations are nice and cleaner than the one on Sand Lake. It's an order at the counter concept and the choices are pretty much sushi, bowls, and bento boxes. Pick your proteins and add ons and you're set with your mean. They do have some boba teas as well. I wish the prices were a little lower since it seems a bit high for what you get. Expect $15 - 20 a person, for a meal and a beverage."
1/30/2022,1,DO NOT COME HERE. I ordered my food to be told that they won't take cash and I didn't have anything but cash you should really say that before somebody orders their food .... SHITTY BUSINESS SHITTY PEOPLE Go to another Bentos!'n
2/28/2022,3,"food was okay, they are really understaff so food did take like an hour. the boba was good no complaints there."
10/21/2020,5,"This is such a great place and has so many options! I'm a big fan of their poke bowls and that you can build your own. Their are so many other choices and their portions are great. Whether your craving sushi, Thai food, chinese food or a bento box, this place has many choices for a good value. Love this place!"
7/16/2020,3,This spot is located in a plaza with other restaurants in walking distance from the margaritaville hotel. We ordered takeout and they took about almost an hour to make. The sushi roll choices are not that diverse. Seemed there was too many crab choices on the menu which I am not fond of. We got to bento boxes with spicy tuna roll and spicy salmon roll. The sushi rolls did not taste that fresh or flavorful. The bento box comes with a tiny salad and unflavorful noodles. Didn't say that on the menu so we ordered a miso soup and side salad along with it. We liked the soup and salad the best. Most likely wouldn't go back there again.
4/15/2019,5,"I recently had the opportunity to attend a media night event for this brand new Bento location, so this review is strictly about the food, rather than service, as they have not officially opened yet! As far as the actual food, let me tell you that you will not be disappointed with the flavors Bento has to offer! Check out the pictures & then visit a Bento near you to find out what I'm talking about for yourself! There's still a lot of construction going on this area, located by the brand new Margaritaville Orlando Resort, but it's beautiful & I cannot wait to see how the whole ""Sunset Walk"" looks when all of the construction is finished! Congratulations to Bento on another location, as well!"
10/2/2020,4,"We were in the area visiting and thought we will go for sushi! The sushi (Crunchy Roll) was really good along with the miso soup. It was a really good choice and defiantly recommend. The Krab wontons I've had better, they weren't that bad. Their side dipping sauces are really good!"
7/21/2021,1,"We tried to place a takeout order earlier today and the guy on the phone was rude. We tried to order ramen he said they were out, tried to order rice they were out, tried to order curry they were out. So could not even get to order. Was excited to try it out but will not be giving it a second chance."
6/5/2021,5,This spot is clean and very efficient service.  Food is fresh and tastes great.  Will definitely eat here again!
5/9/2021,1,"Slowest to-go service ever. Waited 35 minutes past the set time, which was already 30 Minutes after ordering. When I received the order one of the sushi rolls was wrong. Food was average at best."
7/6/2019,3,"I really liked the look of this place, very modern and new in a great area for shopping and dining. The food was great too, maybe a little over priced and not super authentic. But tasted good and the fish/veggies were all very fresh. Lots of options for everyone whether you like sushi or not. I ordered a tuna and salmon poke bowl and my husband got a Korean BBQ chicken bowl. I also sampled the rainbow roll, I really liked that they gave the option for a full or half roll in case you just wanted to try something new. My biggest complaint at this location was the cleanliness. The floor was very sticky and not just in one place. It felt like soda had been spilled literally everywhere. It also didn't seem that the tables were wiped down in between customers, our table was really sticky as well. Thank goodness for that hand washing station!"
5/5/2021,5,Came in today for some sushi and it was my first time visiting this location qnd concept. I ordered the TNT Roll and the special mex. Both of the rolls came out within about 15 minutes in both directions very good. I will definitely return here except somehow I spent $30. Yeah I know me better than no sushi places but definitely not Rigo. The facility was very clean. And the staff was very friendly
6/14/2019,4,"The New Kissimmee Bento location is quite a bit smaller than the other ones in Orlando, service was quick and the restaurant was clean but seating both inside and outside is limited and on a busy day can be scarce. Parking is plentiful as this is I'm a shopping plaza with many other restaurants, stores, and activities. Food was delicious and served quickly and fresh up to the normal bento standards. I was promptly greeted upon entering. I took out rather than dined in and thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I would nto hesitate to return. Just be mindful if you looking to sit down on busy days that may not be an option. I love the build a poke bowl ! Don't miss out on it!"
4/17/2019,5,"This will be a short review. It's the same quality Bento food that you can enjoy at their many locations!This location just opened, so the restaurant is a lot more modern and ""brighter"" compared to their Sand Lake location. In terms of seating, I think they're about the same size.The staff is still very new so they get a pass on service, but they've been really friendly so far. I hope this location does well and doesn't go downhill from all the tourists."
12/2/2019,4,"Poke bowl was really good and fresh however the ponzu sauce is a bit more salty than I typically like and they should dice their cucumbers. Additionally when ordering online there should be no limit to the additions of veggies. Dumplings were also delicious and my husband liked how you can add a side soup or salad. Loved the ginger dressing. Also liked how you can order a mini  bowl. Great for kids, my 4 year old loved.it!!!! Really liked the vibe and concept. Would like to see one of these places open in Rhode Island (would do well in garden city area) would be curious to try other foods. Also the shop is small and I can se wit being overwhelming when busy based off the design of the line in the middle. Yum! Oh additionally they should add chopsticks to the orders. I clicked utensils and got a fork ? For poke?"
2/18/2020,1,I ordered chicken Udon noodles soup to go and it came with no chicken and on top of it the noddles on top were hard....just a overall bad experience for me...not sure if i should give it another try....i would have gone back but i live in the davenport area ... i really wanted to like this place
4/2/2021,5,"Highly! highly! highly recommend this place!!! The poki bowl took me back to sitting on the beaches of Hawaii getting fresh poki from the local restaurants! Fresh, flavorful and delicious! The sushi was off the charts delicious! We will order from this place again and again!"
4/22/2019,5,"This was our first time here. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. It's their soft opening in Margaritaville in Kissimmee, FLWe were 5 people and all were happy."
4/30/2019,4,"I was trying to find something to eat and found this new place on yelp so decided to give it a try. I ended up getting a poke bowl and jasmine milk tea boba. There are signature bowls you can choose from but I like that they also give you the option to build your own bowl.  They also don't charge you for add ons like most places do which is nice. The quality of the tuna isn't bad for what you can get around the area. $11 for poke + boba is a great deal! What I really liked: - That you can build your own bowl - The jasmine milk tea boba - the tea tastes naturally brewed and not artificial; has just the right amount of sweetness. - Great customer service! I originally got avocado as a topping but they were transparent about the avocado quality not being up to par so they will not be serving them. Instead they gave me two extra choices of toppings as an alternative.  A couple things that could be better: - I wish the poke was marinated with the sauce. I thought it was a little odd they give you the sauce on the side. - Rice vs protein proportion. They give you a little bit too much rice for the amount of protein/add ons/toppings that are given. Overall, it wasn't bad at all for a new asian kitchen/sushi spot. I would definitely come back and try other things on their menu!"
1/15/2020,5,"As most Bentos in the area this is just as good and great prices. My wife and I love the poke bowls that we create with a great selection. What ever you taste buds enjoy, they have it. Stop by if you are on vacation or try it if you are a local. Its is worth the trip."
11/27/2019,3,"Really enjoy the food here, be aware it takes forever and most times you get mediocre service. Don't forget if they are out of something that is supposed to come with your food and you don't like the substitution they offer you pay extra to get a full portion! Not sure how that works out for me but more money for them I suppose. Normally love to come here but not if I am going to be nickel and dimed because they don't have the product to complete a dish. Then you get a bad attitude from everyone that you interact with because you complained; and the manager goes sorry you already paid. Gee what a great way to run a business. Recommend: the Pao Pao chicken bowl, Pad Thai, Spicy Bulgogi and all the sushi I have had so far has been good.Don't recommend: being upset about your order or speaking to a manager nobody here cares."
4/17/2021,1,their customer service is  bad and manger is rude does not handle things correctly .the food is fair to okay but when you have to wait hours to get it and it was made a couple hours earlier not great or you pay for food you  never get and their answer is take it up with Uber or pay for it again and drive 35 minutes to get it.have emailed Uber and bento and have been left out in the cold . over 200 dollars later i have been left with subpar food first time and no food second time not sure if I want to try the 3 strikes your rule! WATCH OUT IF YOU USE UBEREATS and order both parties will leave you hung out to dry if there is any problem!
9/26/2021,2,Bad experience. Placed an online order and check out employee told me I was the next order up. Waiting 20 minutes over the scheduled time because he said he would call my name and he never did. During that time I tried approaching the counter to inquire and they kept taking next guest and not letting me come up to ask about my order which was not the next order because multiple people got their food before me. And when he gave me my food he said it just came out even though I saw him try to give my food to other guests and it had been sitting on the counter forever. Terrible service. Everyone ordering was confused and frustrated.
3/23/2021,5,We were so impressed by this place last time we are here that we had to return.  Everyone ordered something that was different than last time to give a better feel for how much we like the food.  It was just as good.  The food tastes better than other restaurants that serve similar food.  This place is highly recommended!
6/13/2020,2,"We had two bento boxes for take out - seame stir fry and garlic broccoli. Food was ready in time for pick up. The smell of the food in the car was better than the taste at home. And what about this cinnamon chips in the dish? Either you love or hate them in an Asian dish. Well, we hate them. The location is nice.But Overall the meal was a disappointment."
3/13/2021,2,"Don't expect to receive your food correctly or together. The flavors are good,  it the three times we've tried there has ALWAYS been issues with the order. It's wrong  or we get the two plates 25 minutes apart so we can't at together."
6/2/2020,5,"The location is great, wonderful for eating outside in the warm evenings. The food tastes as good as it smells. I got a rice bowl with shrimp, it was the perfect size and was perfectly prepared. Excellent service."
11/16/2019,1,"This is normally a place the wife and I come weekly but will not be returning.  This location has not been opened long and after the experience today we were not happy.  They recently opened for the day and it looks as no one did their job the previous day during closing.  The floors were filthy, tables were sticky, soy sauce jars look as if they have not been cleaned in the last week, and the service was very poor.  When the lady brought our food to the table she spilled orange sauce all over the table, never apologized, and never returned to clean it up.  I would not recommend this place."
7/17/2019,3,"My husband and I checked this place out the other day with our 1 year old.  It part of the new Sunset Walk at Margaritaville.  I've very much enjoyed Bento on Sand Lake and in Gainesville so I was excited to check out this new location closer to my home.  There isn't a lot of parking immediately by the restaurant though there is pretty big lot behind the gift shop that is adjacent to Bento.  It is a pretty small location as well and it was quite crowded when we arrived at 6pm on a Monday.  It was also very loud.  My husband had never been so we grabbed a high chair, which they thankfully have plenty of and grabbed a seat.  As I said it is small and quite crowded so there was literally two options for places the two of us could sit with a high chair.  We then looked over the menu and chose accordingly.  If you haven't been to Bento you pick whether you want a Poke Bowl, Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or Bento Box.  Then you choose meat, sauce, and any extras.  You order at the counter, are given a number to place on your table and then food is brought to your table.  Our food came out very quickly which was great.  My husband had a salmon poke bowl.  He said the salmon was great and for the price he felt he got a great deal of meat.  He was less impressed with the rest of the bowl, but said he enjoyed it enough to come back he would just try something different.  I had a Mongolian beef Bento Box.  The noodles and rice were great.  The Mongolian sauce was a bit sweet for me.  I prefer PF Changs or Pei Wei, but I have previously really enjoyed the Chicken Katsu and Spicy Korean so I think I just won't order the Mongolian again.  The salad had very little dressing, but they were more than happy to get me more.  We ordered the kids bento box for my son which for $6 comes with chicken, rice, and string beans.  It's a nice portion for a nice price though I couldn't get my son to eat any of the string beans.  Finally, I had a taro bubble tea which tasted a bit watered down.  Overall it wasn't bad and some of our issues were of our own making.  Other issues could be the newness.  We will most definitely try it again."
11/7/2020,1,"Never again. We used to love this place. But tonight they just put the nail in the coffin. We ordered for delivery at about 6 pm on a saturday night, It is now 8:30 pm and the food is still not here. Now we have hungry kids, we called them and said our order is ""lost"" like wtf! so what do you expect us to starve? the girl on the phone when we called was very unprofessional and seems like she doesn't care at all. So we spent almost $70 on NOTHING. WOW"
7/17/2019,5,"So far all the food is great! It's a order at the counter style restaurant, but the food is fairly high quality! My vegan tofu Poke bowl was really good! Everything seemed high quality and fresh. The staff was friendly and the shop clean. We arrived around noon on a Wednesday and there was plenty of seating. Maps doesn't take you directly here... but if you follow the directions and just look around, you'll see it. There is ""street parking"" right outside. It's a easy stop for lunch or dinner. We will probably be back."
8/2/2019,5,Very delicious. Got delivered using Uber eats. We want to something different in this is nearby. Had good reviews. Food turned out delicious. Only thing I wish the portions were Cut up a little bit more. Everything is just kind of big. It definitely pays to have a knife or utensil to cut your meet up. Possibly the broccoli too. Otherwise this place seems to be pretty consistent at the various locations.
1/21/2020,4,"Florida-based chain that has decent fast Asian food. They have a Poke/Sushi menu and a Stir-Fry menu similar to Pei Wei.The Poke side is healthier with lots of included add-ons. There's also an assortment of drinks (including the area's few boba places). If they weren't pre-made and you can adjust the sugar levels, it would rock! But this place gets the job done for an efficient lunch spotTip: Take advantage of BOGO milk tea and $6 Teriyaki on Tuesdays"
2/28/2021,1,"We had to go order it wasn't a small order it was over $110 both kids bento boxes were  ice cold one piece of chicken for each box last time I looked when you get a sweet-and-sour chicken and you should have more than one piece of chicken and not eight pieces of pineapple, the broccoli was so cold it was like you pulled it out of the refrigerator. We ordered four sushi rolls they gave us two sushi rolls we ordered eggrolls they never were in the bag my curry bowl was supposed to have extra chicken it did not the crab Rangoon was so ice cold that it wouldn't even pull apart when you try to eat it. This place was subpar this evening I don't recommend anybody going I'm getting to go it was horrible and what's worse is we're local people so I encourage everybody to not go there pick a different place"
2/19/2021,1,"I cannot comment on the food as I waited over 70 minutes past my quoted time.  I understand that Friday evenings tend to be busy, however this wait time exceeding a quoted time by this deficit is laughable.  Online ordering was quite easy.  Everything else about my experience was bad.  No apologies, no complimentary beverage, not even a manager saying hello.  Thankfully I was refunded my money.  Wasting my time was on me.  Never again. Best of luck and hopefully my experience was a one-off."
5/20/2020,5,"Ordering from Bento during the pandemic has never disappointed. The taste is always consistent and delicious. We love how everything is packaged and delivered. Not once has it been delivered with sauce spilling or an excess amount of plastic wrap.Kudos to you Bento, you know what you're doing."
9/18/2020,1,AWFUL!!!!!! Worst service ever music is too loud to hear when you are muffled with a mask. Mask fine loud music needs to go... Stupid girl messed up my order and tried to act like it was my fault I don't ever need to come here again.
12/31/2020,1,Our bank account had fraudulent activity and all we had to use was cash and they refused us because that's all we had. Wouldn't even make any exception. Absolutely ridiculous. So we took our business elsewhere and found a better Asian restaurant who got our money instead.
7/18/2019,5,"Fabulous place, Good is very tasty!!!! Portion size is more than enough. This is my second time going and I will be back. Love the location and the staff is very nice and helpful"
7/2/2021,5,Solid bento place. Wasn't hungry but kept eating and eating. Both Katsu chicken and orange chicken we're delicious
7/16/2019,5,"This is a chain but I've liked other locations In Orlando in the past so thought I'd check it out.  Service is good and staff is accommodating and helpful with menu questions.  It is clean and the staff works to keep it that way.  My first trip I had a sushi bento box.  Three small sushi rolls served with salad and fried string beans.  The bento offers a choice of 2 and I had Spicy Tuna and the Mount Fuji, along with the standard California Roll that comes with it.  Everything was fresh and come out in a timely manner.  You get 4 pieces of each.  The sushi is well rolled and the dish presented well.  The second time I had the Bugogi bento box.  The meat was tender and well spiced.  The location is in Margaritaville so you might have to walk a little but totally worth it!"
4/28/2019,5,"Cute fresh place here at Subset Place. One ordered a bento box with rice, ginger salad, lo mein, string beans and Szechuan shrimp filled with carrots, snap peas, broccoli, scallions, all with a sweet and spicy garlic sauce. A poke bowl with brown rice, tuna poke, salmon poke, masago, avocado, pineapple, shiitake mushrooms, fried garlic, scallions, with yuzu ponzu. It was tasty and devoured. Last item ordered was a red dragon signature roll which is tuna, shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. It was all freshly made and came out within 10 mins. See pics of each meal. ;)"
7/13/2019,4,"This fast-casual Asian place hits on a number of points: affordability, cleanliness, and variety. There are so many delicious combinations that you can make from their simple menu, and it's easy to read and comprehend. It's also quite affordable, as $10 can get you a number of bowls that are quite filling. This place is also new and clean, and we noticed several workers cleaning and wiping tables/windows down while we were there. Way to stay on top of it! Bento AKS could, in my opinion, deliver more flavor and sauce to their meals. My lo mein bulgogi was a bit dry and was nowhere near the ""spicy"" that was claimed on the menu. My wife's yellow curry lo mein was similar: noodles quite dry with little sauce to add that extra ""oomph"" to the meal. However, that wouldn't stop me from going there in the future; I'd simply ask them to add more sauce to the dish! Check this place out!"
6/3/2019,4,"Really good, fresh sushi. My order was mixed up and the staff graciously fixed it. I thought the bento box wasn't going to be enough, because I came in hungry as a horse, but it was perfectly filling. If I wasn't visiting town from California, I would definitely be back. But recommend toEveryone who is near by!"
4/17/2019,5,"This place just did a soft opening this week. The entire menu was available! Service was great. Friendly and helpful staff and they continuously came by to check on us. They have a wide variety of food. Everything we had was great. We had chicken vegetable stir fry, udon soup, poke bowl, and a roll. We all enjoyed it. The amount of food given for price is beyond what I was expecting. Will definitely visit again!"
9/19/2020,4,"It was good food! Good portions! The crab Rangoon is my favorite!  I also really enjoyed my pad Thai, could have more sauce though!"
5/5/2019,5,"Love this place! Let's start with the amazing staff. Everyone was super friendly and willing to help. Clearly they have assembled a stellar team and have trained everyone well. You guys were great. Now on to the food. I got the vegetable store fry with tofu bento box and my husband the sweet and sour chicken bento. The portions were filling and the food was fresh and well cooked. My only feedback is preferences based, I would have liked less sauce. In the scheme of things, not a big deal and did not impact the quality of the dish. My son ate my leftovers and had no complaints. The prices are reasonable, generally $10-$12 for most dishes. With their on trend menu consisting of sushi, bento boxes, poke bowls, and more traditional noodle and rice dishes, Bento is ready to take over the world of fast casual pan-Asian food and I am looking forward to it."
10/17/2020,4,Ordered a bunch of food for takeout via grubhub. Order was ready fast and everything was correct and good. Pleasantly surprised. Would definitely order again.
8/1/2019,5,Surprised that a place like this is in the Orlando area.  This concept is simple and its amazing this system hasn't made it to other parts of the country.  There is a staggering number of combinations with which to work with and they have the ability to customize things the way you want.  Food is fresh.Staff is incredibly well trained.  Very welcoming and friendly with a minimum of wasted motion.  The Apple maps app strangely does not work for this place.
4/16/2019,5,"Bento is amazing, and this new location is great! The staff members are all super friendly and love to make suggestions and are very knowledgeable about the menu. The food is delicious and fresh, and you get a lot for a low price. This location also has boba tea (be sure to grab a boba tea punch card!!!) and plenty of space to hang out and enjoy. I always get the sushi combo box or bento box and leave very full and happy! Great location, so happy it's now open!"
3/3/2020,5,"To say that I go here a lot is an understatement. Everyone knows I love sashimi and bubble tea. Bento has both of these, made deliciously and at a great price. I LOVE this location. It's so nice to walk around this area, light music playing outside and happy people all around. It's right next to the Margaritaville resort in the shopping area called Sunset Walk. Its really nice and chill with lot's of stuff to do, and decorations, so it is really nice to sit outside and enjoy a bubble tea or a sushi roll. Of corse, I always get the poke bowl, I love the build-your-own. I get rice, salmon poke, avocado, and wakame. They have 3 different build-your-own sizes, so if you get the larger ones you can get more types of sashimi and more toppings! I always get the yuzu ponzu sauce on the side and furikake seasoning on top. Honestly you cant go wrong with this whole menu, I think I've tried it all. Other dishes worth mentioning are the Orange bowl and the Szechuan bowl. You can get either with your choice of chicken/steak/shrimp/tofu as the protein, and noodles/greens/rice as a base. Milk boba tea is my fav and never disappoints. I love Bento and this location is especially premium!"
7/25/2020,5,"Amazing takeout every time. Food is always right, and the meals are neat and filling. I wish there was more variety with sushi but the noodle bowls have become a huge hit in our house! Definitely have been multiple times since the start of Covid and will keep going back"
4/18/2019,5,"We were so lucky to find such a delicious restaurant nearby our hotel. The food was both authentic but also different with their flair for fusion, and clearly the best food we have eaten all week in Orlando! The menu has so many options and combinations at first we didn't know what do choose. But everything we ordered came out so tasty. The fusion of flavors was outstanding, I especially liked my Korean bugolgi with ramen noodles. Never had it this way before and it was the best.The yellow curry was superb, very authentic and rich. A great balance of flavor and spice. And the staff was very friendly and attentive, checking to make sure everything was perfect. Thank you!Next time we are in Orlando this is definitely our first stop for food!"
5/12/2021,5,"I have not been disappointed yet! The kimchi, sweet n sour, orange chicken,  and a few other options were all good! Will definitely continue to go back!"
4/3/2021,1,"IF YOU WANT CHINESE FOOD NEVER GO HERE Absolutely terrible service. I wish I could even say the food is ok if I would have gotten my order. The employees are clueless. They don't even know their own store's phone number. These people suck. I ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box and they told me 20 minutes. When I went back in in 20 minutes, there was nothing. They acted like they didn't even know that we ordered. I went in, and the place was packed. There was NO social distancing at all and they had no safety measures. When I told them that I had ordered, they said that they had no order placed under my name. I was furious. I went back to my car and got my phone to tell them that I had called THEIR number. They then proceeded to bumble like fools. They tried to argue over wether or not I placed an order 30 minutes ago. The man behind me in line came to pick up the order that he placed online for delivery 3 HOURS AGO. THESE FOOLS THEN PROCEEDED TO ARGUE WITH HIM TOO. I hate being this person, but if I could give them negative stars I would."
6/14/2019,5,"This place was awesome! Food was delicious! Service was greet, one of the cooks explained to us the dishes and which one he recommended best! We got the food very quickly and this place was very clean"
12/9/2019,4,If you're looking for a quick Asian meal this is the place. Hot or cold dishes they've got it covered. The miso soup is delicious and have yet to try anything that wasn't wonderful after visiting 4 times.
12/1/2019,4,"This place is great. I am not a salad eater. Never have been, but I am a believer after having the mini poke salad with teriyaki chicken pinapple edamame and fried onions with teriyaki sauce. There are tons of other combinations but this is my forever order there. Its amazing. My wife gets the salmon and rice and never says no to going there for a light healthier dinner. Give it a chance you won't be disappointed."
1/2/2020,1,"I called and placed an order, verified my phone number to the employee taking the order, and provided the name of the individual that was to pick up the order. Surprisingly, the location of this restaurant was actually much further than Yelp indicated. When I arrived at the restaurant, the employees informed me that the order had not been completed and they also stated that the restaurant did not have the necessary components to make one of the rolls. However, the employees at no point contacted me to inform us of this. After changing the order, I went to a nearby store to give them time to prepare the modified order. Over 25 minutes later, the order had not been complete. I had to wait nearly an hour to receive my order. At home, I noticed that they had not accurately substituted shrimp in my role. In addition, they provided no chopsticks for an order of only sushi, only a few packets of soy sauce for 4 rolls, and only one slice of ginger per roll. Overall, I found the customer service to be terrible, the orders to be inaccurate, and the food to be lackluster. I especially would not recommend this establishment as they could not even correctly put the order under my name accurately. - sincerely not Gabriella!"
5/11/2020,5,Awesome and delicious surf n turf is my favorite bowl! 100% recommended i had a great experience every time sushi and everything is great
12/28/2019,5,"VEGAN REVIEW! While on vacation in the area, we (the vegan family) ordered poke bowls from this joint. They were awesome! The rice, white and brown, was very fresh. The fruits and veggies that we topped the rice with were also very fresh. Loved the ginger dressing! I highly recommend for healthy, WFPB, vegan meal!! Yum!"
3/26/2021,2,I order Sushi Combo Box aunt I miss stuff on the sushi and I order white sauce and I miss you too
3/21/2021,5,"We placed a really late order at 9:30pm and they delivered amazing food promptly, the food was delicious highly recommend!"
2/13/2021,1,"First time here, pickup order supposed to be ready at 8:25. Showed up at 8:38 and told it would still be another 10-15 minutes... final time of food ready was 9:05. And the order was incomplete and missing food. WORSE service and experience!"
8/21/2019,4,"The place is very nice. Some of the staff was very friendly. The sushi box was amazing. We also got the white rice bowl with teriyaki chicken. Although the rice lacked a lot of flavor, the chicken was great."
9/24/2019,5,"We enjoyed the other option for building a bowl on the menu. My choice was on the From The Kitchen section. On this menu you choose a base, pick from various entrees that are customizable, or you can go with a signature bowl. Mine was Teriyaki - which had white rice for my base, which came with peas, with teriyaki chicken and steak (I added an addition protein). The meats were grilled perfectly and were both extremely juicy. The teriyaki sauce wasn't overpowering in sweetness, and I got mine on the side as to add the amount I personally wanted. She was in the mood for something a little more fresh, and opted is much better about her veggies that I am. So she went with the Veggie Stir Fry - which consisted of a white rice base, broccoli, mushroom, carrot, snap peas, red bell pepper, zucchini, soy garlic sauce, and shrimp for the protein choice. The entire bowl was full of a delicious mix of the garlic and soy sauce."
1/23/2020,5,Amazing food and friendly staff. Have eating here twice now and every time is the staff is friendly and the food is great. Have not had an issue before at this place and I don't see one coming.
11/11/2020,2,Fast food style Asian - ok at best.  Neither of us would go back. Had noodle and rice bowls.
7/20/2019,2,"When I first saw this place I was so excited because I love all Asian food and the seemed to offer a variety.  Maybe I should have followed my first mind and just got the poke  bowl; because really how can you mess that up. However,  I didn't follow my first mind. The sushi was ok. It was comparable to fresh grocery store sushi.  I ordered the pineapple fried rice, which I've had at several other places, and I couldn't eat it and threw it away. My son ordered the veggie bowl with children with ramen noodles. Threw that away too. The flavor was not horrible but his noodles tasted bad. My husband ordered the koren bowl with lo mein noodle. His food was eatable. It was definitely a waste of my money."
12/4/2020,1,Sushi is not fresh. I didn't like it at all. Came from NY to spend money in a frozen sushi? Nah!
11/25/2020,5,Great sushi! The fried rice was the best I've ever had. Ordering again twice in one week.
4/17/2019,3,"This is just another restaurant for the tourist in an overdone and overcrowded shopping center. Honestly the food is good but, not worth the price. For the same price you can go to a sit down restaurant and have someone wait on you. This is more like an upscale Panda Express. You have to wait in line to place your order then they give you a table marker and bring the food to you. There are too many great local restaurants to settle for high end fast food. The food portions were plentiful but, I am willing to bet that in a couple of months the portions will be half the size."
6/9/2019,3,"It was pretty much just a Pei wei, but i didn't try the sushi.   I will update this after i try it because i heard it was really good but the veggie spring rolls were so so, the Krab wontons were definitely sub par, and the garlic broccoli with shrimp over ramen was pretty salty."
7/27/2019,5,"Really refreshing slushes with boba or jelly! I had the lychee slush with lychee jelly and it was amazing. We were only there for the summer drink on a hot day but saw the lunch crowd and decided to give it a try. This was the only busy establishment in Sunset Village at Margaritaville. We shared the lo mein with Gen Tso's  chicken in a bowl and the sushi combo ( 8 pc California and 2 of the 4pc regular rolls) - fresh and yummy! I really liked the poke soy sauce that comes with any roll...you have a choice of various sauces. Bright and clean atmosphere...staff are constantly clearing tables, restrooms are large and clean. Keep up the quality of the food and cleanliness!"
7/22/2019,5,"Food is so darn good, like an Asian food chipotle. Seating is a little cramped and weird. Cashiers BARELY know how to be a cashier, and know literally nothing about the menu. This score is 100% about the taste of the food."
5/18/2019,5,"This place has it all poke bowls, sushi, boba tea, noodle bowls, rice bowls bento boxes and the food is all made to order.  You order at the counter and then they bring it to your table.  This is like if Pei-Wei but so much better!!  I had the Korean Steak rice bowl and the person I was with got Bulgogi Bento Box and I also had sushi which was fresh and tasty.  Definitely coming back here to try everything on the menu!!"
7/6/2019,5,"Food is amazing, sesame stir fried anything is fantastic! Orange chicken is good, wish they put more sauce in the bowl. The sushi, oh man the sushi... amazing! TNT roll=amazing... MT Fuji roll = heaven! And the Boba Tea... oh man, i tell you what... speechless. 10/10 would go back."
5/17/2019,5,"New place on HWY 192.  Food is good, staff friendly and very clean environment.  It has become a regular for us."
6/23/2019,4,"We ordered the build your own Poke Bowl via Uber Eats and they were fantastic. Very fresh, great flavors. Steamed dumplings were also really good. Was not impressed with their side salad so will steer clear of that in the future, but the portions and freshness of the poke bowls more than made up for it."
6/22/2019,2,"2 stars for bad service and mediocre food.Ordered 2 kids meals a sushi box and 2 order specialty sushi. 4 soda and 2 sides white rice. Total was $66 that was the first disappointment. Sat down at a table got a number. They brought out the rice first then the 1st kid box. About 10 minutes later another kid box came out , then another 10 minutes went by and we got our sushi box. The kids box was really the only positive. The sushi box had spicy tuna and the Cali roll. It was the worst bland non tasting sushi I have ever had. We all finished that food and still didn't have our full order. Then they brought the other sushi to the wrong table then when the people there realized it wasn't what they ordered the folks at bento sushi decided to them bring it to our table. I got my $22 back.Point blank if you like and want sushi this is not the place to get it."
8/17/2019,2,"We have eaten at Bentos in our hometown of Gainesville FL many times and have never have a bad meal. However, while on vacation here in Kissimmee we decided to try what we thought would be a good choice of the many eateries that exist in this area. Margaritaville is still quite new and Bentos is one of the restaurants in the development. We ordered and waited to take back to our resort that was not too far away. We had to wait 30 minutes or so and were not the only disappointed customer who was waiting for their take out. The place got crowded after we placed our order at about 9:30 on a Saturday night. Another party of 7 or so came in and sat down for dine in. They started receiving their food before we got ours which was ordered first.Continuing to wait we saw more customers come in and order and they too were now subject to waiting for their food. We finally got our food 30 minutes later and on visual inspection was nothing like our home Bentos.We get back to our room and ate the meal only to find the veggies (broccoli and snap peas) too hard to eat. The portion was smaller than our usual eatery. The rest that was shrimp, rice and a scattering of peppers were ""ok"" - at least the shrimp was cooked and not rubbery.We will not be returning to this location."
8/11/2019,5,"We come to Bento almost weekly and always enjoy our meals -- everything is fresh, there is variety (something for everyone) and the service is friendly. We had one error in the many takeout visits we've had and the manager remembered us BY NAME the next time we came in. We were very understanding because we know that this happens, but she really and went above and beyond to make it right. We've always enjoyed Bento but we're a sucker for great customer service and they now have our full loyalty!"
8/7/2020,1,"I went to Bento last week and was extremely disappointed that their employees were not wearing their masks correctly to protect their fellow coworkers and their customers. I ordered my food and waited in the seating area and saw employees with the masks under their noses while preparing the food. None of the employees corrected their coworkers or advised them to pull the mask over theiwhich is very disappointing. I brought my concern up to the cashier and I kept an eye on him as I left with my food. He didn't go to the manager, he just went back to whatever he was doing. Also, while I was waiting for my food, they also allowed a couple to order food who did not have shoes on and only had a T-shirt covering their mouth. I will not return since they don't seem to care about public health and safety."
6/30/2020,1,"Place an order and was told it would be 30-35 minutes. Got to the restaurant and paid and was told the food wasn't ready. After waiting an additional 30 minutes past when they said it would be ready. I was handed cold food. When I got home to eat, there was chicken mixed with my tofu. I don't eat meat so I had to throw out my meal. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, meat eating or not."
6/25/2019,4,"Bento is a solid, quick-eats restaurant. They make nice simple sushi rolls, beautiful bento boxes and would have received a five star review if they didn't run out of boba so often. They are new to the area, so it is possible they are still figuring out how much boba they need each day, although, they offer a punch card for boba, so should be better stocked.I would not make a special trip only for a Boba. In fact, I do not go there for boba any longer, because they do tend to run out often.  However that being said, they are called Bento and do live up to that name. It's definitely worth your time to stop in and have a bento box here."
6/16/2019,1,its father's day and half my family for there meal COLD and not right and the rest of us got forgotten about this is my first meal of the day im starving been here for a half an hour and it's super busy they don't give a fuck... i ask to speak with a manager ect it's just so unorganized they food is rushed this sucks i want my money back! currently sitting at this fuckinf table still haven't ate!
4/4/2020,2,First time having Bento - we did carry-out and they forgot the sauce I ordered on my Poké Bowl! Sauce probably would have taken my meal from a 6 to an 8.
2/5/2020,5,Very good- fresh ingredients. Well flavored. Salmon poke was excellent. My sons had sushi rolls and a different poke bowl and they ate all of theirs! Mom win!
2/16/2020,1,"This was the first and LAST time we will eat at this establishment. We checked out the menu before we arrived and they said they offered brown rice upon request. So we waited in a long line for about 20 minutes just to find out, while we were ordering, that they didn't have any brown rice made. My husband asked if the were making some and the guy said ""No"" and that they won't be making anymore tonight, even though they were still going to be open for few more hours. We went ahead with our order with white rice because we didn't want to take the time to go somewhere else. Then my husband ordered Boba tea and they were out of Boba. NO SIGNS ANYWHERE saying they were out of these items. We sat down at a table and waited for our food. The place was packed and there was only one table cleaned off. There was a four person table next to us that had rice spilled all over it and dishes that hadn't been picked up yet (a couple with two very small children had just finished eating at that table). Since it was the only table that was free a lady and her two young sons sat there while her husband went to order food. Nobody came to clean off the table even though two employees walked passed the table and looked at it. She had to ask someone to come clean the table off. The employee had an attitude and picked up the dishes. She came back with a rag and wiped all of the rice that was spilled on the table onto the floor and seats. She didn't even clean everything off the table...she just walked away. So now there was rice all over the floor and on two seats. This wasn't a little bit of rice, there was at least a half a cup The lady went to get napkins to clean up the rest of the table and clean the rice off the chairs since the employee never came back. I started looking around and noticed that the place was dirty. The floor was sticky too. My husband received his food but I waited another 15 minutes for mine. The bathrooms were filthy and they were out of paper towels. The only good thing about this place is the food was good, but after seeing how dirty the dining room and bathrooms were I'm afraid to see what the kitchen looks like and that's all I could think of while eating my meal."
7/7/2019,3,Was looking for a Sushi place near my resort in Florida when we went on vacation. Sushi is decent as my son and brother ordered them. I ordered the udon soup with tempura which is decent but not the best as the tempura is small and batter is not flaky. Bulgogi beef is not what I expected and pad thai is just ok. Staff are friendly. Worth another trip? Maybe but not on my A-list.
6/23/2019,5,"Was craving sushi and found this place. Such a good variety. My favorite thing we ordered was the kids box. This was the best ""kids meal"" we ever ordered. Highly recommended. Delicious!"
9/30/2019,5,"While on vacation in Florida, I desired sushi and came across Bento. The fish was delicious. Everything was fresh and quick service. The staff was friendly. They should bring this to NY"
4/21/2019,4,Food is good. My husband had the yellow curry and my son the Pad Thai.  Both dishes were fresh and tasty.  My poki bowl was very good and the teriyaki steak was tender.  This place is fairly new and the staff is friendly.  The boba tea tasted genuine.  This is definitely a come back again place.
6/14/2019,2,Honestly had high hopes. Had the pineapple fried rice with steak. Fried rice had the texture  almost same as oatmeal.  Steak was lackluster and nill seasoning.  Wasn't impressed.
5/31/2019,2,"Not at all what I expected from the branding.  Not terrible food but not great either.  Similar to ""pei wei""...I would consider it fast food Asian.  If you love and appreciate sushi, avoid it here at all costs...you will certainly be disappointed. I feel like we are accepting less and less quality as a society every time a place like this opens."
7/26/2019,2,"I was willing to give this place another chance after one bad experience. Long story short, I was given a tonkatsu ramen soup with no soup broth. (Just noodles and chicken strips on the top. That's it.. ) from a take out order. I decided to visit today and order up some food after a long, stressful day at work. I made my order and I asked a question to the cashier concerning my last one as if it was normal for this restaurant not to include the actual soup, she only responded with ""Sometimes yes and no"" ... That doesn't answer my question, but okay. (Gave a 10% tip even though she didn't really deserve it in my opinion.) No sense in stressing over a order I made a while ago. I just wish I had more of an explanation or an attempt to make up for it. I sit there and wait for my order, which was a pad Thai and volcano roll sushi, and I received someone else's by mistake. I informed the waitress that this isn't the sushi I paid for and gave it back. They handed the sushi plate to the guy who also had my order and just allowed him to keep both. So I had to wait for mine again.. Easily up to 10 minutes. I barely touched my pad Thai from being so upset... And when I finally received my sushi order, it was clearly rushed. Didn't look nearly as nice as advertised or the plate that other guy had. The roll was barely cut and it was smothered and drenched in mayo with barely any masego eggs and there was no crab meat on the top or all around. I've had this roll before from this same location and it was so much better than what I received just now. Someone did arrive to briefly apologize and offer me a small Boba tea and I appreciated that at least.. (Sadly, it didn't taste good at all. The tapioca balls were mushy and tasted like they had been probably sitting there all day.) Honestly, I would not come back after receiving (Pardon my language) half assed service. The pad Thai at least was decent, I'll give it that. This wasn't worth my hard earned money and I regret coming back at all."
5/21/2021,5,"I was first introduce to Bento a long time ago in Gainesville and haven't been back to a Bento in forever.  I was working in Oviedo that night and decided to Doordash from Bento.  They were about to close soon and had to place my order soon.  Plenty of variety of items to choose from on their menu, but I knew I wanted a noodle bowl so I decided to get the Orange Chicken Noodle bowl with green, red bell pepper, and green beans.  Plenty of chicken in the bowl that was season well.  Everything tasted well together and didn't seem overly salty.  I would like to try other items on their menu next time.  Food came pretty quick and it was still hot. I will more than likely order food to go from here again."
10/5/2022,1,"Very poor experience when I ordered from here on Monday (10/3/22).  I did online order ahead to be picked up at 7:56.  I arrived at that time but didn't walk out the door until 20 minutes later.  The people who were in the store line to order sat and received their food prior to me.  The communication to me about my order was poor or nonexistence and nothing was said about me waiting there for that long.  We ordered 2 rice bowls, a side of Green beans ($6), and one sushi role.  One bowl i paid the extra to get extra chicken, which was not a noticeable upgrade at all.  It still felt like a small portion.  My opinion is these bowls have a lot of rice to seem make it a decent portion. This was a $46 order and I was not satisfied at all for what I got.  Not sure if i'll try again or not."
6/28/2021,4,I have not been to Bento in such a long time but man did I miss this place! I decided to get a Bento box with beef and I was so pleased with my meal. This meal is filling without stuffing you so that you feel terrible about yourself. I love that whatever you order is fresh made and I don't mind waiting a little bit more for that. While I waited I had a boba tea and you know what?? It was actually pretty good and that makes me so happy because you cant find a lot of places in Oviedo with boba tea these days :( Prices are great and I think overall this is always such a classic stop for anyone craving quick Asian.
10/15/2022,3,Ordered ahead. Didn't get my food till about 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Food definitely not worth what I paid. I ordered noodles and a couple other things and it came out to around 70$..... the noodles came with three shrimp. Three. For the whole dish. My family and I didn't think it was worth it at all. We even got soup. Cause you know who can mess that up.... We dumped it out. It was nasty. Needless to say not going back.
12/8/2021,4,"I had not been to Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi previously, but stopped here on the recommendation of my son who had recently eaten here. The menu included a pretty Vince variety. I appreciate the range of options on the menu. While here you can order either an Asian kitchen dish, a poke' bowl, or sushi (rolls or bowls). I opted for a poke bowl; the Regular size includes 2 proteins and I selected Tempura shrimp and tuna over rice as a base. There are plenty of vegetable and topics to select from as well - all the usual suspects; asparagus, mushrooms, wonton chips, edamame, etc. There were a decent selection of sauces too, of which the staff was willing to provide a description of any I wasn't sure about. In the end, this was a nice poke bowl......This is a chain restaurant, and if I am being honest, I had lower expectations from them......but, they managed to provide a really good poke bowl that exceeds probably all of the the other chain places that I've tried. There are definitely a lot of Poke Bowl places in town to compete with and while they probably don;t top out several local small restaurants, they were definitely above average and worth a stop in. I'm interested in trying their sushi the next time I'm in as well. Everything I saw here looked tasty. The restaurant is easy to get to, it is right off of Alafaya/434 in Oviedo inside a shopping center; there is plenty of parting.....while there are several restaurants & shops in the center that tend to be busy, I've never had any trouble finding parking in this parking lot. Inside the restaurant it is a line/queue style ordering, then you either sit down with a # for them to bring it to you, or you wait for it as Togo (which is what I did). The inside of the restaurant seemed to have plenty of room, The tables were well spaced out so you are comfortably distanced and not interrupted by neighboring patrons if you were to eat-in. A good experience. Looking forward to trying more things on their menu."
1/7/2021,4,"I've been doing some places on the weekends, getting takeout and watching shows on Disney+, and this place ended up on Orlando Weekly's best poke list for 2020. So I decided to come here. It's only like a mile away from my apartment, very convenient. I got a poke salad with a couple of big hunks of friend salmon, some edamame, cucumber, grape tomatoes, mango, some crispy wontons, and maybe some other stuff. With a side of Tom Yum dressing. It was very good. The salmon was cooked well. And the other little sides were all welcome pairs to the salmon. A little sweet, a little crunch, a squirt of tomato. A nice, fresh little poke salad. I was a fan. I also got the Chicken Pad Thai (rice noodles, bean sprout, red bell pepper, egg, carrot, scallion, tangy peanut sauce). This was the far better dish. Very heavy, but that peanut sauce gave it the tang it needed to not just be a grease bomb in your belly. I got a couple of signature rolls, too.The Crunch (tuna, krab delite, cream cheese, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce, panko-fried). I'm not usually a fan of the deep fried rolls, but this one was not very oily. It was nice and warm and not overloaded with sauce, which is always a risk with these kind of rolls. I recommend you get this, if you have any concerns. And the TNT (flame-seared tuna, masago, spicy tuna, cucumber, scallion, spicy mayo, tempura flakes, togarashi). This roll had a very nice, big bite of fish. It tasted very fresh and there was Just enough mayo to add creaminess to the chewing, but not overpower everything. Garlic Edamame was good, Pork Dumplings were good.Overall, this place was good. If you live in Oviedo and are craving quick, relatively inexpensive food like this, go ahead and pop in. You won't be disappointed."
12/23/2020,5,"I haven't had Bento for the longest time, and they still don't disappoint! This time we got the poke and Mongolian chicken udon bowl for lazy Sunday night dinner, both were fresh made with excellence. They are one of my favorite poke places in Oviedo/UCF area, you get a lot of toppings/protein for a very competitive price! As for the Mongolian chicken, you can really taste the burnt oil smokiness from stir frying in the hot wok. This made it so lovely and is something impossible to copy at home. I will probably come back to Bento more often!Bento to me is not just a regular Asian fusion restaurant, it's also reminiscence and nostalgia of college days. When I tried Bento for the first time in Gainesville, where Bento was born, the small town broke college girl was surprised by the value/great combo you get for the Bento box (back then it was less than $10 for sushi, main entree, salad, rice, and a dessert). Alongside that, everything was really good! I kept on coming back, pretty much had everything on the menu by my sophomore year. And I'm sure many Gators share the same memories.With that said, I'm surprised to see how far Bento has come all these years. More shops, better/more modern decor, same taste and same food, a little pricier but that's also natural inflation. Now that I'm no longer a broke college girl and am surrounded by amazing food, sometimes I forget about Bento and not as appreciative anymore. I will definitely come back more often though!"
10/24/2020,5,Their new location is nice and never had their build a Poke. I must say I was surprised on how good and packed with protein it was. Everything was fresh and can't imagine how much bigger the large is. I had the spicy tuna and salmon and liked that it had more of a kick than other Poke known places.
12/25/2021,3,"Food is tasty, always has been. My issue is that this place used to have good food, good portions, and good value for money. Across the menus prices have gone up by $2-4 and now it's like $12 for a noodle bowl with chicken. Those are sit down restaurant prices... plus they removed the Masago add on from bowls ((probably to make them cheaper to make)). Disappointing :/ Probably won't be coming back, just no longer worth the price."
4/28/2022,4,"Good food, light on meat.  Pricey for what you get..  Eat there regularly and they are light on any of the meat.  Recommend ordering double portion of meat for any of their meals/bowls."
1/3/2021,4,"Thankfully, delivery is available in our area, due to COVID. Great food. Adorable little Bento Boxes for the kids. And the Boba Thai Tea was amazing! My favorite part."
11/20/2021,1,"3 strikes your out! We have been going to bento for many many years. When I found out they were building one in Oviedo I was very excited. Unfortunately every time we've gone it has not been anything Close to what the other two Bento restaurants taste like. The first and second time the sushi taste old. The ingredients were not fresh. This last third time we found hair in a sushi roll and as soon as I went to pour my son's noodle bowl there was a bug that came out with all of the noodles. I don't know what their doing differently at that store, but we will not return."
6/9/2021,5,Not many restaurants in the area offer this type of food.The sushi bento box offers a lot of sushi.
10/2/2021,2,First time eating there and ordered the Mongolian chicken and a boba tea.  The total amount came to over $19.00! Wow! I told myself that this better be off the chain for that price! Was disappointed by the portion and the food was Lukewarm.  Boba tea was bitter and served with a paper straw that stuck to  my lips when i tried to drink it. Price was way too expensive and mediocre food.
7/19/2020,1,"Bento is one of our favorite spots because the food is always good! Only reason I am giving a one star review is because of the customer service. We ordered our typical order and got this note attached to it stating that it is an additional charge for white sauce. There is no issue that they charge for the white sauce, would have just been nice to get a quick call saying that and we would have happily added some and paid for it. Just disappointing to get your food and be missing one of the best parts!"
10/21/2020,5,I had an awesome meal. The Zombie roll looked awesome and tasted great! I got some spring rolls and they tasted great. They weren't crispy at all but that happens when you get fried things in takeout. This was my second time and it won't be my last. The servers inside were friendly and helpful when I went in to get my food.
10/15/2020,4,Decent food - did take out twice (because of Covid). . . would not hesitate to order again.
6/10/2020,5,"Normally, this is the type of restaurant that I avoid like the plague, so I am almost embarrassed about how many times I have been here already since they opened the doors to their latest location.  For the life of me, I can never understand why so many times we see restaurant after restaurant featuring the same exact cuisine fail in the same location time and time again.  This spot has held several Sushi restaurants in the not too distant past.  I think what will help Bento succeed is their variety, cost and speed of service.  Each time I have ordered so far, the items have been ready in 15 minutes or less.  They have a good variety of rice and noodle bowls representing a number of Asian flavors.  The bowls have a good mix of protein, vegetables, carbs, and sauce.  I have tried Coconut Curry, Orange Chicken, Mongolian, Thai Pineapple Rice, and enjoyed them all.  The Egg Rolls were very good, and I have enjoyed all of the Sushi Rolls I have tried as well.  One thing I like about them is you can get a half or full roll for an order.  The Fried Avocado Roll has ended up in my bag 3 times already, and I am guessing it will again soon!  This is a great addition to the neighborhood for a quick, flavorful meal that won't break the bank."
6/8/2021,1,I have never been so disappointed with an order from bento in my entire life. I spent $20 for flavorless chicken and raw veggies. The only thing good was the sushi and there was wasabi accidentally sent it all over it. The waiter was also super confusing and had no idea what he was talking about or doing. Also waited 35 minutes for food that is below satisfactory. I got a bowl with chicken and udon noodles and the chicken is absolutely flavorless and the broccoli and carrots are not even fully cooked. Super disappointing for the money I paid.
6/19/2020,5,This food is amazing and* I miss good food (from SF). The service put up with me and they all wore masks - were super clean.  The pickup process was easy and super safe. The owner really put money into the community and I love the way the restaurant looks. Keep rocking Bento!
11/11/2020,5,"I stumbled on this little gem quite by accident, and I sure am glad!!  Haven't yet dined inside, but every week, it seems, I'm craving their food.  Ordering straight from their website is still delivered by Doordash, but you forego the ""service fee"" Doordash charges above the delivery fee.  Always arrives earlier than expected and perfect temperature!We have only had some of their sushi, soup, egg rolls and their bento boxes.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious.  Their boxes are a step above anyone else's.  They add a small salad, rice, green beans and those delicious little cinnamon sugar crispy noodles (there aren't enough of those, if you ask me!)Can't wait to dine in!"
10/11/2020,5,"This place gives big portions and everything i've tried is super good. The stir fry vegetable w chicken, the pad thai, the egg rolls, Orange Chicken, and sushi is very good."
4/21/2021,5,Love this place. Sushi box is my favorite with mountain fugi THE BEST!!!  They always served on time and never have problems with my orders. People are nice and have different options for the family with affordable prices.
8/11/2020,3,"I tried a sushi box which came with a California roll and 2 other 4 piece rolls of my choice. It also came with a salad and some noodles. The sushi is decent and seemed fresh but not the best I've had. The salad had no dressing and if I was supposed to choose one, that wasn't made clear as I told the server it was my first time there. I asked for extra wasabi, but received barely 1/4 teaspoon which was hardly enough. It was my first time there so I'll give them one more shot to see how they do."
3/8/2021,1,"Have eaten at this location a few times and while the wait is usually insane or they forget sauces, I got the Korean chicken rice bowl last night and woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pains. I continued to have pains all day today and have been postponing taking an exam because it hurt to sit up. After finally going to the bathroom and deciding to pull trigger, I managed to throw up about 10 times and finally got all the bento out of my system and instantly felt a thousand times better. I've only gotten food poisoning twice before this in my life so this meal probably ruined Bento for me for good."
9/3/2020,4,The poke bowls are amazing and the sushi is really good.  The staff at this location is very nice. Management is fair if you were to ever have any issues or questions.
9/17/2020,4,"Clean, friendly, good food at great prices. Love the brown rice vegetable options. Only wish they had curbside so I could swing by with the kids more often. Broccoli garlic is always a go to. Love the vegetarian sushi options"
8/11/2020,5,"Great food, Great service.... I had the beef Katsu with udon noodles and it left me wanting more! The workers were so kind even in this time of crisis. They not only had delicious food but it was all so fresh and such a wide variety of different umami flavors, I can not want to come back!"
3/13/2021,1,ordered rolls and they were cold and premade. they even admitted to premaking rolls. if i wanted premade rolls i would have gone to Publix. this place has gone down in quality.
6/6/2020,1,Had to wait 35 minutes for a basic order and the store wasnt busy at all. They also got my order wrong but I didn't bother because it probably would've taken another 30 minutes to get it right. The UCF location was much better. Wouldn't get food from this location ever again.
12/21/2022,4,My wife and I really like the food. The service was very fast and ambiance was great. We got the Mongolian chicken and shrimp. The empolyees were super friendly would go again
12/20/2022,5,"Pao Pao box w/ shrimp was scrumptious & I love how it gives you a little bit of everything (salad, rice, noodles)! Also, if you love super spicy food go for the firecracker chicken rice bowl--it is tasty and burns real good!"
9/21/2022,4,"I've been a fan of Bento since college! I moved away from Orlando for a while but now that I'm back, I'm so loving having this location close by! I get the same thing every time (spicy cream chicken) so I can't speak for the entire menu, but this specific dish is great  I assume everything else would be just as tasty!"
3/17/2022,5,"Lunch is around the corner right?  If you haven't tried Bento, you're definitely missing out and let me tell you why: 1. More food for your finances. I always order the Bento Box cause it has a little bit of everything inexpensively .2. It's Fast Food without the unhealthy optionsNew Drink Options. 3. The Berry Hibiscus and Lavender Lemonades have snuck themselves on the menu and it's a refreshing little treat!Don't take my word for it though, try them out today and remember to their lemonades will be gone soon, don't miss out!!!#wtfisfor"
12/11/2022,2,"This place is pretty good. But man oh man I've never gotten my order in a timely manner. Regardless how I order it's always 30 min wait. And for a ""in and out"" joint that's a super long time. I mean even for a restaurant that's long. Unfortunate that they're so incredibly slow because I'd come here more often."
11/29/2022,2,"Bento is consistently average.   With so many sushi places around, Bento is not even on my radar anymore.  My wife likes it, yet I don't get it.  The sushi is no better than what Publix offers.  I have eaten at this location no less than 5 times aver the last few years and each time I think how average it is.   And be warned, if you sign up for emails or texts, it seems relentless!"
5/10/2022,3,"I've been to Bento many years ago it was so good, so when my cousin mentioned us ordering lunch here on a Monday afternoon I was excited. We ordered from their website which was very easy to navigate. Pick up was contactless and easy as well. The food was just okay. I got a Hot Lava Roll, Spring Rolls and Bento Box. They were both okay. The bento box is mediocre at best, spring rolls are good, and the hot lava roll was okay but small. Overall the food is not great but I don't know if I'd give this location another try."
11/30/2022,3,"I went this evening to get some dinner today is Wednesday, November 30, 2022 and I have the Bento Asian kitchen App. So while I'm sitting in my car I place my order on the Mobile app they told me 5:15 PM my food will be prepared and done to pick it up, so I went in a few minutes earlier and unfortunately my food wasn't ready until about 5:30 PM so I'm sitting in the lobby waiting and waiting for my food to come to me. The staff was pretty nice and courteous for the most part but for me to place my order ahead of time and have to wait Over 15 minutes pass the time they told me to get my food is a little unacceptable. They were not that busy so I don't know maybe they're short staffed in there. My food was tasty though after I finally got it I got the pineapple chicken and shrimp Bento box, now the only thing that I did not like was the salad it was just the spring mix of salad just thrown in the plate no oil and vinegar no salad dressing no nothing very plain and blah. I also got an appetizer of the spring rolls now they were pretty good I must say, I've been to this location on several occasions, but it has been a few months since I've been here. I would say I'd recommend it but don't take them on their word when they say your food will be done at a certain time and it's not thank goodness I didn't have another appointment to hurry to get to come on guys and gals get it together."
3/28/2022,3,"Ordered: bento box - chicken katsu with Japanese curry. White jasmine rice. Standard ginger salad, noodles and garlic green beans. Since it was Monday and 4ish they were doing a happy hour promo for free pairing of an appetizer (-4.00) I ended up choosing extra ginger salad. With a soda cup. Total: $18.11 + tip (15%)The BAD:1. Japanese Curry: this should be revisited. They used too much water which making it too runny and lost a ton of flavor. I was disappointed I could eat it with my chicken katsu or my rice.2. Wonton noodle crisp: it was seasoned with cinnamon. This reminded me of Taco Bell's churros lol. After small taste I left it alone. I was very confused about this side.The Good:1. Chicken Katsu: cooked and fried well with a good portion2. Noodles: we're good and tasteful3. Ginger Salad: typically and good4. Garlic Green Beans: tasteful and goodConsensus? Maybe it's not worth buying the regular portion and maybe it's worth to just buy the kids version. Pick a different sauce because I've never had watery Japanese curry... price and food didn't match. Maybe because it's new location? I'll think twice before I try this location . Who knows maybe I'll try their poke bowl or sushi at this location but there's doubt.*I was too hungry to take a picture of the chicken katsu."
5/23/2022,2,"We absolutely love the downtown location, and this more convenient location has been pretty good the few times we've been, but our dinner yesterday was disappointing. I usually get yellow curry chicken katsu, which was unavailable for some reason, so I got a regular yellow curry chicken. Despite the curry sauce poured on it, the chicken tasted like it had been washed after cooking, with zero seasoning at all. Worse, because my meal came out almost immediately, I had already finished it and boxed up my leftovers before my wife's meal arrived. (My meal was out within 2 minutes; hers took over 20.) No matter how much I like a place, that just can't happen."
12/16/2020,4,"4 stars for food4+ stars for menu choices4 stars for service3 stars for inside of restaurantBento (for short) became one of our go-to places during the various stages of lockdown this year for many reasons. First and second are the food choices - something for everyone in my family - and the food quality/taste. I've especially enjoyed the Spicy Beef Bulgogi rice bowl and build your own Poké bowl among others. I relish the customization options of the Poké bowls. My wife always orders the Veggie Stir Fry rice bowl with tofu - when you find a dish you enjoy, stick with it! Other family members have ordered and enjoyed the noodle bowl option as well. We find it to be a fair amount of food for the price. It's not the Wednesday $ rolls specials at a local grocers and it's not the $$$ specialty sushi locale, but its place is just right in the middle.I've received great service - friendly and helpful -  at this location every time, even during lockdown. When I most recently ordered for pick up, I noticed the inside was partially blocked off for delivery and pick up orders. I found that change made my order pick up easier. A few patrons ate inside without masks of course but every worker I could see was wearing a mask and gloves. As a side note, the fair pricing became clear on a recent order.  We first attempted to order from a different build your own sushi bowl place, but it was more expensive with a discount than Bento's normal pricing. Looking forward to the next time!"
12/26/2020,5,"My fiancé and I get take out from Bento fairly often. I used to get the Mongolian Noodle Bowl with udon noodles and I loved it. I recently started doing the Build Your Own Poké Bowl (pictured) instead and that has been my new go-to. I get mine with brown rice, chicken teriyaki and steak teriyaki, carrot shreds, avocado, edamame peas, and wonton chips. I'm a little obsessed. It's so flavorful and a big portion for being the regular size. It's enough for me to do half for lunch or dinner that same day and then the other half the next day. And with the white sauce mixed in, it tastes even better! My fiancé usually gets the Pao Pao Noodle Bowl with lo'mein noodles (forgot to picture) and he loves it, especially with white sauce mixed in. This one is a little spicy and a good portion as well, but he normally finishes it all at once. This is his go-to and is always craving it. For appetizers, we have tried the krab wontons (pictured) , the spring rolls (pictured), the steamed dumplings, and the fried dumplings. Every single one of these is so good, but I would say the fried dumplings are my favorite. The service here is great and the prices are good too. When we get take-out/delivery, we normally use Postmates. It's packed well, the food is still hot when received, and most of the time it delivers pretty quick. Love Bento and would definitely recommend!"
11/10/2021,5,"Good food, good prices, quick nice service. What more could you Ask for? All locations I've been to around orlando are consistently good. Great casual lunch spot fo hit around town."
6/2/2022,2,The General Tso chicken & noodles did not taste like General Tso & the bread around the chicken was hard
3/30/2022,1,"Every time I eat at Bento, I say the same thing when I leave: ""I'm never eating here again"".  The food itself is good, even if they do get my order wrong more often than not. The biggest problem is the service. It takes forever to get your food! Today, I placed an order at 6:19 PM for one Poké bowl, which I planned to eat before my 7:00 PM meeting a few miles away. At 6:35 PM, I asked the guy making the poke bowls if he was working on my order and he said yes. At 6:45 PM I asked him again and he pointed to the counter where my meal was sitting while five employees talked among themselves. After getting their attention, one of them brought my food to me, unceremoniously dumping it in front of me without even an apology. I had to scarf it down and leave. The place was not busy. There is no reason it should take 26 minutes to make one poke bowl. I'm done with Bento."
9/19/2021,5,The food is great and the menu options are awesome.   The poke bowl is fresh and the tuna used for the sushi was great
4/27/2022,5,"Exceptional just absolutely delicious. Some of the best sushi I've had. Great atmosphere, very spay and relaxing. Great tile work on the wall too. Not the cheapest but everything is made to order so no complaints at all. I would eat here err day if my wallet would let me!"
1/18/2020,3,"Went in for a quick meal and my Yelp app offers a free appetizer with a $10 purchase yet when I attempted to use it the server stated it was not for this location but the one downtown instead. Which is very odd since I have frequented this location 99% more than I have the one downtown. The appetizer offer does not list a location on it at all, only stating it needs to be dine in only and not valid for shrimp tempura.Got the shrimp pao pao and it came out good, in this order the shrimp did not have the nasty taste like the previous time so I was able to enjoy the meal."
1/28/2021,4,"We enjoyed our visit to Bento. Their place is really clean and Covid-compliant, and they make great food. We tried three of their sushi rolls: the Bamboo Roll, thr Specialmex roll, and the Hot Lava roll. Our absolute favorite was the Hot Lava roll. The roll itself contains escolar, shrimp tempura, and avocado, topped with a warm, spicy scallop and crab mixture that was delicious... yum.We also really enjoyed the Special Mexican Roll: shrimp tempura, cream cheese and avocado, topped with shrimp,  eel sausce and spicy mayo. The flavors worked really well together. We didn't care for the Bamboo Roll on its own, as it was too dry for us, but it was good when dipped into some spicy mayo.We can't wait to go back to try some of their hot dishes. Their soba noodle bowls look amazing. All in all, we recommend this place.Don't just EATTHRUUS, eat at Bento!#eatthruus"
3/12/2022,1,Still a one star . No change. The email l for the contact person on the reply was not valid.
7/2/2020,4,"I ordered takeout from here on uber eats because delivery fee was only 0.99. I think there was buy one get one free drinks as well.I got the Mongolian bbq chicken with lo mein noodle bowl. It was around $8 total including uber eats fees and delivery. It was HUUGE!! I was able to eat it for two days straight! The container it comes in is really deep and they packed it well. I was really impressed with the serving size! The only thing was that it was too saucy so it could get overwhelming at times. Would order again if I needed something quick, cheap and filling!"
5/24/2019,5,"Have you ever BEEN TO BENTO BEFORE??  Say that 3 times fast: BEEN TO BENTO BEFORE BEEN TO BENTO BEF-.. sorry, just being dumb, lol. Got myself a POKE BOWL consisting of Tuna, Salmon, Masago (fish roe), Cucumber, Jalapeno, Wakame (seaweed), Scallions, Tempura Flakes, and Spicy MayoQuite delicious, could taste the freshness.  You could say it was 'So fresh and so clean clean, lol.  The crinkle cut cucumbers gives it a fancy touch too.Definitely liking this place!"
5/28/2021,5,"Another visit. This time I ate the Lomein with Tofu, and drank a fountain beverage. Quick, easy and delicious."
5/26/2020,3,"Ordered takeout from this Bento location and wasn't impressed. The sushi was warm and tasted like it had been sitting out for a bit, even though I picked up my order on time. The spicy beef had a good flavor, but the salad in both bento boxes was wilted and underwhelming. I usually order from the Bento restaurant in Altamonte Springs and have never had an issue there. Maybe this location was having a bad night, which is understandable with everything that's going on. I will say they had their kitchen and cash register sectioned off from guests with tables, and it seemed like they were taking all of the necessary precautions for health and safety."
3/23/2021,2,Ugh...really disappointed with this location. First time here as I usually go to the downtown or sand lake ones. I substituted my lo neon for more green beans which is an extra cost (+$$$). I got literally 8 extra green beans spaced out in the bento box. Unbelievable. Food tasted fine. I was in a rush or would've complained. It was like visiting chipotle with the skimpiness.
12/23/2021,4,Love this place!!! Love the bento boxes! Super great milk teas and a great staff ! Lovely
1/20/2020,5,"First time here to actually eat. I've been here several times to pick up deliveries for UberEats and Postmates and have always wanted to check it out. So my boyfriend and I came during lunch hour, around noon on a Monday. It was steady busy but our order came out fairly quickly. I got the Bento Box, Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken. My boyfriend got the General Tso Chicken Rice Bowl. The portions in the bento box were perfect. I devoured everything; lo mein, ginger salad, and green beans. The pineapple sweet and sour chicken was perfect. Will definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.. There is plenty of seating available inside with some tables to enjoy outside as well. The place is clean and staff is friendly and patient. From delivering through UberEats or dining in, always great customer service."
12/7/2021,1,"Used to love eating here, but not anymore. This location refuses to take gift cards, the menu prices have gone up about 4$ for every item on their menu over the last 2 years. It used to be 8$ for a rice bowl, it's now 12$. The bento boxes used to be 10$ now they're over 15$. The new prices are outrageously over priced for the food you get. Definitely not gonna be eating here anymore."
1/27/2020,1,WowSmhI've never had this happen before in my life such poor poor poor service the food was actually pretty good but I got up to refill my drink and the server took my food away and then refuse to give me my money back after I only ate about 20% of the food They were actually rather nasty and offered to make me another order but I already spent over 30 minutes there what a waste of my time and moneyExtremely poor customer serviceBye
12/12/2020,4,"Bento is a great place for a consistent meal at a reasonable price. My staple is their poke bowl, which you can get in multiple sizes depending on how hungry you are. You get quite a bit of food for the money, even at the smaller sizes. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious. I also occasionally go off the sushi menu and have always had a good experience there as well.More often than not, I order Bento for delivery. It's only every once in a while I go to dine-in. The restaurant is clean and the service is always quick. I've been impressed with the measures they've taken since COVID to ensure customers are safe with changing the flow of the order/pay line and keeping people outside for as much of the process as possible.Good sushi. Good poke. Good prices. Can't go wrong."
3/8/2019,3,Pros: chicken quality was good. Large pieces of white meat. Quantity was filling. With the bento box you got to try a variety of things. Cons: Worst Boba tea I've had. Very sweet and boba was soggy. Chicken wasn't crispy but I think it was tempura cooked so that is simply a matter of preference.
10/19/2021,2,Really gross steak. Don't pay extra for it. Only four pieces were edible (two of which were really tiny). Then there were two giant fatty clumps of meat that were inedible. Quality has really declined. Basically paid $15 for rice and vegetables.
2/9/2021,5,"I'm Bentos number one fan! I order my lunch here almost everyday. Their food is outstanding and customer service is out of this world. I order fried avo roll and add cream cheese every time. I've had meetings here, brought visiting friends and family, ordered in, ordered take out. Like I said.... number one fan."
3/20/2022,1,I waited 45 min for a mobile order to be ready at 9:30pm. They close at 10 and I was still waiting by 10:15pm. Slowest location ever!
3/15/2022,1,This place is an over priced sushi place. If you want authentic sushi do not go here. The menu is super limited the chick with reddish purple hair is super rude. They don't offer cash payments and that is very inconvenient. When I asked about the no cash the woman with the hair didn't even look up and rudely said they don't carry cash because of Covid and they don't want to get robbed. That is hysterical. Don't go here if you don't want a bunch of 19 year blonde white girls making your sushi. There is a place right behind it called Thai place go there. Not to mention I open my food and there is barely any wasabi.. and it's discolored and the miso soup I got doesn't have any tofu just mushrooms.. this is rediculous
4/4/2021,1,"I watched the girl put in chocolate powder in the cup after me asking for taro and after telling her it's chocolate she says ""it's taro it just doesn't have a lot of dye in it ""?? Wtf . Maybe they need to start drug testing the employees cuz this happens more often than not at this location ."
9/15/2020,5,Pretty delicious!!! And great deals!!! I got the sushi combo box... omg you have to try the mexican roll. And the employees were SO KIND and welcoming. They gave us free water bottles bc their machine was down. What other place would do that?Def recommend.
3/4/2022,1,I place a mobile order (2 sushi rolls) at 11am when they opened. Arrived at 11:15 and over 15 (dine in and carry out)  customer orders were brought out before mine. When I asked about my order two people behind the counter were quite rude about it. I come in twice a week for lunch and will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.
9/14/2020,5,One of my favorite spots in Winter Park! Large variety of options! Definitely recommend this place.
7/15/2020,5,I have been going to Bento sushi for years. They originally out of the Gainesville area and they have a reputation for great quick service sushi. I particularly like their combo box where I can pick two rolls and they do not charge me for brown rice. They are also taking very special attention to the Covid situation and they close their dining room on their own choice to help prevent the spread. Love Bento and I've been going for years.
8/20/2021,1,"Always ""temporarily closing"" for online orders.  Hire more staff to keep up with demand.  The quality is not good either. Probably because the have cheap management and owners."
7/1/2019,4,"This was the first visit for the Bento location after having been to the Sand Lake location a few times. This one is wayyyyyy cleaner so that was definitely a plus. It's also newer but I hope they will keep that up. Our sushi specials were fresh and tasty! My daughter and I are tea fans as well so we grabbed some boba and Thai iced tea as well. Portions are large and we like to do a little sharing which works out perfectly. Easy, fresh, and tasty. Perfect."
9/4/2020,3,"I ordered a rainbow roll and made my own mini poké bowl. You can order sushi rolls to be either 4 pieces or 8. I did the 8. The roll itself was yummy. I really enjoyed it, tasted fresh and the size of each roll was nice. The poké on the other hand, not so great. I ordered it with white rice, tuna, red onion, cucumber, avocado, sweet chili and masago. The tuna tasted weird and it's texture was just odd. Never experienced that before and I love tuna. Didn't taste that fresh which was disappointing and a little concerning. The sweet chili sauce was just ok. The red onions weren't sliced all the way and were left with the head of the onion. Yuck. I would only resort to sushi from this place. Staying away from the poké :("
7/28/2019,3,I just tried the Hawaiian Poke Bowl.  It looks pretty but it was ok.  It's more of a rice dish than Poke.  They put too much rice and less Tuna.  The mango is a nice touch.
8/30/2019,4,Bento Asian kitchen was pretty good I was impressed with crunchy role but the pork dumplings could definitely use some work. They just didn't have a lot of flavor. This is one of the better sushi like places in the area though so I'll be back but I do wish there were more traditional roles.
6/8/2020,5,"This is my absolute FAVORITE place. The customizable poke bowls are so worth it and delicious! I get Bento all the time and I'm always satisfied. They have great prices for the poke bowls considering that the QUALITY is top notch. Especially the salmon, tuna, and everything is just so fresh. I'm happy that I discovered this place and after my first time, I was hooked. Now going two or three weeks without Bento feels like foreverrr. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I always like playing around with the combinations of the poke bowl and the way I get it is like eating sushi but in a bowl  I love Bento!"
4/18/2019,3,"Updated review now that I was able to sit and eat.They still only had 1 person taking orders which was peculiar considering the line started growing rapidly after we ordered and I didn't see anyone else go up front. So, this issue is still ongoing. We ordered the Mexican Roll, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Katsu. All 3 tasted great, no complaints. However, they don't have any options for tea, which was odd.. husband usually orders tea at the other location so FYI. Overall it's an OK option for a semi-quick eat if you're in the area. ----------------------------------------I didn't get to actually sit and eat. This review is purely on entering during dinner rush hour. When we entered the restaurant the line was probably 20 people long. I noticed only one person was taking orders. I thought, no way they'll just leave her alone with this sudden rush. Ten minutes in line, only 2 people had been helped and I had to go. I will try to come back when it's a slower time of the day and review on food. Hop"
10/26/2019,2,"Took over 30 minutes to get my to go order for poke, they gave me a ginger salad to compensate. Normally, I am a super understanding person because I've been on the other side, but when they take forever to make your order and then get it wrong? I asked for mango and got pineapples instead. Luckily I'm not allergic to pineapple. And yes I probably should have checked my order before leaving but I was already waiting on the cusp of 40 minutes.Food tastes fine minus the pineapples. Jasmine milk tea was flavorful and boba were nice and chewy. I'm just really disappointed because this my first visit here after a lot of my coworkers recommended it to me. :(Just some advice, please try to pay closer attention to your orders. Probably won't be returning for a while."
4/9/2019,5,Stopped her for lunch ! Yummm! The menu is great and has a wide variety. I was low carb so I stuck with the create your own poke bowl! The bowl was so fresh and delicious. The tuna and salmon was fresh. The service was so fast! They also have warm bowls like chicken teriyaki and noodle bowls. They have sushi and boba tea. I tried the mango green tea! It was amazing! Not too sweet at all! I can't wait to go back and try some rolls and hot food! Pricing isn't bad for the amount of food that you get. I would like to be able to choose more toppings for the build your own but other than that no complaints. Great lunch place!
1/31/2019,5,"Five stars for a much needed Bento in the Winter Park area! I complete majority of my shopping and errands in this area. By the end of it, a girl is in serious need of some good lunch. I absolutely enjoy the Bento Box. You get the best of many worlds by ordering it. The amount and variety of food included in the box is genius and such perfection! My mouth is watering as I type this lol. The creamy chicken tastes unique and leaves me wanting more. I believe they call it the pao pao chicken if I am not mistaken. I also like to order their miso soup."
2/16/2020,4,"Didn't think the food would be good, but man I was wrong. Their chicken fried rice is simple and tasty without being overkill on flavor or texture. Everything tasted fresh and was made to order so that's cool. I just really wish they'd have more ramen options, it's so hard to find quick and cheap ramen options without going to a fancier restaurant. I also really wish they'd be a little quicker with cleaning the tables. There was a rush and it seemed like empty but when we tried to sit at the tables it seemed like every other one was dirty and just needed to be wiped down. Otherwise the restaurant was nice and quiet for the most part and clean."
12/12/2018,5,"So grateful for Bento joining Winter Park! They couldn't have selected a better location.. Nestled right on Lee Rd and Orlando ave. Recently remolded plaza with a new modern feel. Tons of new businesses just opened with more to come. Bento never goes wrong with design both interior and exterior, just a pleasant atmosphere all around. I simply cannot wait for their outdoor patio to be completed. Their menu has something for everyone and the food is just absolutely cooked to perfection every time. Simply no complaints or nothing I would change. Been here twice already for lunch. Customer service is on level 100 for sure.. plenty of parking and seating all around. I recently ordered the Spicy Bulgogi  bento box and so happy that I did. Got a little of everything as pictured below. The beef was thinly sliced and very flavorful. Oh and their lo mein is phenomenal!"
2/28/2021,5,Went here for the 1st time since it has opened almost a year ago. It lived up to the hype. The sushi was top notch. We ordered online and it was ready well before expected. Staff was friendly when we walked in to claim our order. I would love to dine in once Covid is more under control. No complaints about the food at all!
9/7/2019,5,"Walk into this restaurant, just WOW. I love the look of it, super modern. Also you can watch the employees make sushi from a little observation area, by the soda fountain.Me, my mom, and my dad each ordered Poke bowl, and they were absolutely scrumptious(photos attached)! Special thanks to the staff for such fast and efficient service.Overall, this Bento visit was unlike any other, and a huge recommendation for sushi lovers and beyond."
1/6/2019,4,"I did take out and got the sushi combo which comes with California roll and half portion of 2 classic rolls for $11 and it comes with a side salad and some sort of pickled red cabbage. The rolls I got was the shrimp tempura without masago or cream cheese and the spicy tuna without spicy mayo. Both these rolls and the Cali roll was delicious and well made. A lot of places put too much rice but this place had the perfect amount. The snags with my order is that the cashier overcharged me and couldn't figure out how to fix it, she was attempting to refund me from the tip jar but I didn't feel right about that so I told them it was ok. When u got home I noticed the salad had no dressing so basically it was just lettuce and carrot. I also could have done without the purple cabbage, it didn't really complement the meal. I'd definitely go back and try the bowls or the other bento boxes."
3/4/2021,5,"Reliable and high quality eastern cuisine! a favorite of mine is the curry, and they have great procedures for covid"
11/25/2019,1,So how does a place that serves ASIAN food and half of their menu is SUSHI  have a 20 minute wait on Sushi on a MONDAY night and have a full staff in the restaurant for dine in. Wow how crappy won't be coming here anymore.
2/9/2020,5,I'm not sure if Bento is a chain but with my first experience  I was not disappointed. I had the Chicken Pad Thai and I found the dish to be fairly flavorful. The portions offered was good and the price point was  affordable  at 10 dollars. This place also offers Poke bowls and a few bubble tea drinks. The place had a modern contemporary feel inside and would definitely  recommend this place  for a quick lunch or dinner place.
10/17/2019,2,"I had a very jarring last experience at this location. I had placed a phone order so as to save time on the way to work. Nicole, who had taken the order, was very abrasive and irate off the bat. She continually cut me off during the order and made it very apparent that she was annoyed taking the order. Setting this as the tone made it feel as though as I was inconveniencing her and her time. Normally I would brush this off and not have this bother me, but the icing on the cake was that the order was wrong. I had ordered the chicken curry Katsu and had received the traditional chicken katsu with just the Japanese bbq. The unprofessionalism displayed here and the incompetence in taking orders is too cumbersome to overlook. I hope that the energy given off by Nicole isn't the same energy given off by the rest of the staff."
8/17/2019,4,Good place to grab a decent meal :) I tried their pad thai my last visit and it wasn't bad! On the spicier side for sure.
2/23/2019,1,"Go somewhere that cares about you as a customer. Orlando has some brilliant restaurants. I'm appalled at the disrespect of the Manager at this establishment. My family and I have been eating here since it opened. Like any restaurant with a high flow we expect issues here and there no problem. Tonight though was ridiculous. We tried a Green Tea with Pineapple. The menu says Green Tea. We got a Jasmine Green Tea. My wife is allergic to Jasmine. When I asked about it, I was cut off mid sentence with ""Our cross contagion policy"". No, I'm sorry. No, it's a 3.50 drink what can I do to help make you feel better. Just it's your fault. We spent on average 40 dollars a meal here. After telling the manager that her leadership and management skills were lacking and I was highly offended, I advised her we were never returning and it was her conversation that did it."
12/5/2019,4,"Went here with my husband. I got the garlic broccoli rice bowl with chicken very good..I tried to use a coupon on Yelp for a free appetizer didn't realize till the manager came and looked that this was for the downtown location.Was hoping that the manager would maybe still honor it since I already accepted the coupon and now I will lose the coupon but she did not. That is why I didn't do a five star review. Food was so good. Definitely be back to try more dishes, just wished they would have honored the free appetizer coupon."
9/8/2019,5,"Bento has a special place in my heart, it's one of my favorite food spots in Orlando and I'm constantly craving it. Literally everything on the menu is so good and will not disappoint. The staff is already friendly and fast. I take all of my friends and family here and always recommend it! Please go!"
8/8/2019,5,"I love Bento. My first experience with the Asian Kitchen was years ago at their Gainesville location. They've since expanded to have 2 locations - one downtown and one in winter park. Downtown has a slightly swankier sushi bar vibe, and winter Park is a very approachable quick service spot ideal for lunch or dinner on the go. The sushi menu includes a decent selection including a number of classic basic rolls (your rainbow, California, and spicy tunas) as well as signature rolls (I like the Hot Lava). For sides go for the garlic edamame - so good! My pick for entrees comes from the ""From the kitchen"" section - here you pick an base entree (Mongolian beef, Korean chicken, etc) and have it served in either a rice bowl, noodle bowl, or bento box. My favorite combo is a Pao Pao Chicken noodle bowl (I always pick udon noodles, but lo mein and ramen are also on offer). Bestie gets the build-a-poke bowl because he believes in healthy eating - boooooring! Enjoy!"
8/28/2020,3,I entered the Resturant and I was not sure where to go. I finally figured out where to order. I placed my order and got the Mongolian bowl with lo me in noodles. The food was hot and fresh.However no salt or pepper was at the table and the server looked confused when I asked for it. Taste is everything for me. Brandy is an awesome server. She deserves a raise. She was so helpful. Since it was my first time here she made it easy for me to order.
5/15/2019,5,Amazing food and super fresh. Portions are large. The menu is big with so many options to chose from. We will definitely be going back!
1/28/2019,2,"This review is based on a to-go order. I brought a meal home for my wife and I and everything seemed to be...sloppy, at least for me. My wife loved her presentation of her Bento box, but she could only enjoy half of it because the rice didn't seem to be cooked all of the way through. She only ate the protein and some greens. I ordered a salad with some Umi and I got chicken instead. I will give this place another chance in the future and may dine in to give it a better chance because, dining in and taking out can be two completely different experiences."
2/2/2019,3,"I had a chance to check this place out on a Saturday night. My neighbor had been recommending this V.S my favorite Asian fast-food. Well, I did not have a high expectation but It's kinda disappointing. I went here with my toddler, and I asked a younger guy with glasses on if he can help me with a high chair, I told him where I was seated, he said he would. I finished my order and I had to ask a lady at the counter again. While I have no age favoritism I felt that the younger people who works here are less helpful. OK that was the first impression. I ordered their limited time Spicy Pork Miso Ramen,  a taro boba , and a kids meal for my toddler and they were another disappointment. Being an Asian and maybe it was how I was brought up, I hate to waste food. BUT there's an exception. If I won't eat the food I'd bring home I rather not bring it home and that's what happened. The Ramen portion was big but the pork had a not-fresh after taste and 'Gawd' the soup was very salty. If soup was meant to be a salt broth then I'd rather not have it again- But I know it's not suppose to be that way. The chicken in the kids bento was kinda hard to chew on, tasted a little bit salty too considering it's for a child. The only thing I finished was the taro bobba, I admit it was good. Also I want to add that this place is not a family or child friendly place. Youngster Staff in the dining area raised eyebrows on my cheerful toddler. Nope. Not recommended."
6/1/2019,5,"Bento is by far the best local sushi restaurant chain in the area. The Winter Park location is great and convenient, with a decent amount of parking and good service.My Bento go to will always be the sushi combo box -- really a great deal for a good amount of food. Comes with a salad, vegetable, 8 pc california roll and your choice of 2 rolls to add. Highly recommend the Special Mex roll! And get spicy mayo as your special sauce to add - YUM! When I don't order my usual, I love the Pao Pao spicy cream chicken with rice, and the poke bowls are customizable and delicious as well. This location also has bubble tea so be sure to ask for a bubble tea punch card . Buy 8 and get your 9th tea FREE! If you're looking for your next restaurant obsession TRY BENTO! You won't be disappointed."
5/6/2019,4,"So happy there's another location aside from Dr Phillips and downtown. Even during the busy lunch rush food is exactly as I expect. Love the ""creamy Siracha chicken."""
5/19/2019,5,"I love the fried dumplings, the white sauce, and the sriracha garlic chicken. Everything I have had here has been excellent! Just wish they had brewed tea along with the fountain drinks (instead of the bottled tea...cuz I get thirsty lol)."
9/3/2019,5,Food is delicious the staff wasFriendly the 2 times I e been there we have enjoyed our food  and the staff was smiling and seemed genuinely sweetgood prices too cheaper than the place I used to go and tastes better (jade off Edgewater)
8/31/2020,1,"I ordered a stir fry bento box from this location through Postmates, my food arrived cold and I mean cold like it had been sitting out for quite some time. The chicken was over cooked and dry and my boba tea tasted rancid, possibly from the milk since it was a milk tea option. I was given a $2.00 credit through Postmates. Never again. I spent about $25 on this entire order."
5/20/2019,3,"The bento boxes are awesome, the bowls are a lot of food but very tasty.... today is the first time I'm trying their sushi.... it's easy to grab and go or sit and eat with a grp, casual dining. The sushi looks beautiful for a counter service type of restaurant they spend the time to make it look and taste great. Tried the caliente and the bamboo roll, my friend had the tnt and the spicy salmon. Our other friends order was messed up and although the bento boxes and bowls are great some of the sushi rolls weren't rolled well and fell apart right away."
1/5/2019,5,"Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Order at the counter and they bring food to you. Sushi is great-nothing super fancy but very fresh and well prepared. I love the bento box style of eating so you get a number of different items. My wife and I split a sushi box (8 pieces of California roll and two different 4 piece rolls) with salad and a hot entree box. The noodles, salad, little desert are perfect. We got the garlic broccoli chicken and it was delish!The kids meal box is a lot of food for a great price. My two kiddos split the box and it was plenty of food!"
2/6/2020,4,"I was meeting a friend here at Bento Winter Park location.  She came early so she ordered for me already.  When I got there my bento box was already on the table.  I ordered  fried tofu with Korean cooking style.  Overall it wasn't as good as tofu with Sichuan cooking style I had at  UCF location.  The sauce wasn't savory and had too much oil in the cooking.  It's really filling with ginger salad, green bean and the Lomein on the side.  Luckily my friend got me some sweet chilly sauce and that was flavorful.  I dipped everything in that sauce and finished the box.  My friend ordered a poke bowl and she finished hers before I got there.  If I come back here I will order Sichuan cooking style."
1/11/2020,3,Charcoal chicken. Very over cooked and burned for the chicken teriyaki. Just white rice and dry burned chicken with a few green beans. The noodle bowls were better and the sushi was tasty.  Next time I'll get a bento box. The bubble tea tasted like perfume.
11/20/2018,5,"I have always been a fan of Bento Cafe. I usually went to their downtown and Sand Lake Road locations. I went here on their soft opening to try out their usual dishes. I ordered the Pao Pao Spice Cream chicken with Lo Mein noodles. It tastes the same great quality as their other restaurants. I'm glad they open this location. Downtown can be tedious to go sometimes since it can be very busy and parking in the garage takes time. This Winter Park location has great parking and still have fast service. Definitely would like to come again and try their pokè bowls. I still haven't tried it. For a soft opening, the service and food was great."
5/3/2019,3,"Good food, like always.  But ... this location needs to work on their delivery. I was there yesterday around 6:15 pm.  After 15 minutes, my sushi arrived. Then another 10 before my granddaughter received her California Roll, 10 minutes later she got her miso soup ... all while my grandson waited for his udon soup.  A full 40 minutes went by waiting. Meanwhile they served more than 8 other tables that not only arrived and ordered after us, but those tables finished and left. And still we waited. I went up after the first 25 to find out where The udon soup was and received the answer of we're really busy.  Not a good excuse. That only works if the other 8 tables were waiting. Do I think they didn't know how to run the orders? You bet. Disorganized, slow kitchen, no excuse.  Get it together or you will start to lose business"
5/27/2020,5,"I tried this place today for lunch.  My first poke bowl ever! I have to say thatI was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something quick to eat, and came across Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi.  The place was well frequented by customers. Nicely decorated, with friendly staff. I ordered the small poke bowl, for which I picked white rice, breaded chicken for the main entree.  It came with up to 5 toppings, which I picked cream cheese, mango, wonton chips, avocado, and something else I can't remember! :) Came with two sauces, I picked spicy mayo and garlic one.   I have to say it was filling, very fresh, and very tasty! Good size too even though it was small.  The price was very reasonable at $7.50.  They have medium and bigger sizes too, and a whole array of sushi rolls for sushi aficionados!  Would definitely try other dishes in the future when in the area. Would recommend!"
1/18/2019,5,"My boyfriend and I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened in Nov. I have tried something different each time and I can honestly say I've enjoyed every dish. I still haven't figured out a favorite but I'm leaning towards the Sesame Tofu rice bowl. The tofu here is so good, being vegan I normally have to suffer through ultra plain and boring tofu as a protein substitute but this place does it right. The sauces are always coated thoroughly and make  it so flavorful.Staff are pleasant and attentive :)"
9/28/2021,2,"I've purchased take out from this restaurant several times.  Generally the food has been fresh and tasty. However, the past 3 times I've been pretty disappointed with the quality, specifically the fish.  Each time I've ordered a Poke Bowl with Tuna and each time the Tuna was on the edge of going bad.     It's been dull pink, mushy and fishy tasting.  Also, when ordering online, they have a great feature to save your order so you can simply duplicate the order.  However, they change their menu so often, you can't really duplicate it.  It's simple things too - they used to offer several sizes of Poke Bowls - Small, Medium and Large (with 3 proteins) Now, there's Kids and Regular.  You used to be able to get Tofu as a protein option or Brown Rice instead of sushi rice, now they're both gone, but they still offer them on other menu items.  It's these things that changes the impression of a restaurant, and has us second guessing for our next to-go orders."
1/12/2019,4,I only had edamame and steamed dumplings but they were good. The edamame was not overly salty and came as a large helping.The steamed dumplings had good flavor and a good portion of meaty yum!.I have not been here since 98. I know it's a different setup but just as I remember flavor wise.
2/15/2020,4,We frequent this place often because I know I can count on delicious food fast. My family and I have never been disappointed! The food is excellent value. The only thing that makes me nuts is how uncomfortably cold they keep this place. Please turn the AC down!
3/9/2019,1,"My first and last time coming to this restaurant.  I ordered viet porkchop bento box... I only ate couple pieces of the pork and finished the noodles, fried crispy noodles and salad.  After about 10 mins! I rushed to the toilet Diarrhea ! I felt soooo nausea too... I basically trashed my meal after what happened to me! The fried noodle wrapper tasted-bitter and oilly, perhaps they re used the old oil? Maybe that got me sick? Maybe it was the salad got me sick?The pork chop was deep fried too, and I could immediately tell they used too much meat tenderizer or baking soda... the meat had no texture too soft... very disappointed! I tried it and disappointed."
3/3/2020,4,"I was looking for a place like this for a while, usually sushi is very expensive and the price in bento are very favorable, my only concern was that it take a very long time to get the order ready, we are talking about 20-25 minutes, the cashier explained that they have a lot of internet orders and that is why, any way the food was amazing"
3/2/2019,5,"I love the DT Orlando location, so I was glad this location opened in November. It's fast-casual and you can get 4 piece classic rolls for $3.50-$4.50. Prices are reasonable and the service has always been great. I've ordered on DoorDash and UberEats and they are always quick to prepare the order, unlike many other sushi places in the winter park area."
8/8/2019,5,"So when I walked in I thought I was going to leave unsatisfied and hungry since this place looks like an average fast food restaurant that sells Asian food. Well... this place was amazing! Huge rice bowls and the sushi rolls are very big as well and very little rice, with lots of seafood! We came during happy hour so it was definitely worth it, you get an extra roll when you buy two rolls and a soup or salad when you buy an entree. I loved it, will definitely be back!"
5/13/2019,5,"Good food, always a favorite lunch spot in winter park. Quick and easy if you don't have time for a long lunch. Also travels well to go if you can't stay."
8/5/2019,4,"Bento is a family favorite! And the Winter Park location never fails us! My husband and son LOVE their Pao Pao Chicken and rice and I love their bento boxes, sushi and noodle bowls. Everything is always so fresh and delicious. The only thing I haven't had a great run with is their teas. I've tried two different flavors (both recommended by employees) and ended up not liking them at all. Maybe those teas are not my thing? I may try one more next time. But overall a great place to get your Asian/Bento fix. Not bad for a food chain! Clean, spacious atmosphere and good customer service."
4/18/2019,4,"Ordered the Korean Steak Bento Box, Orange Chicken Rice Bowl. And Kids Teriyaki Box. Food looked and tasted good. They even have ramune soda and Sapporo beer Definitely will come back!"
5/21/2019,3,"Sushi tasted good (not the best I've had, but not bad as well). They messed up my order, but I was frustrated and didn't request my correct order. Hey did offer free sala or soup while I waited for my order though."
9/17/2019,1,"After recieving the company's comment, I emailed to have not recieved any emails or communication back from them. Not only poor customer service, terrible food but owners who dont care to respond when they ask you to reach out"
7/27/2019,4,I was surprised my the quality of the food. I ordered a Bento box with the shrimp tempura. The food was super fresh and they got the line down in no time. The line stayed out the door the whole time. Now I know why - great food
9/23/2020,5,"This place is delicious, love it and have tried it many times.  My only complaint would be their avocado portion is minimal but otherwise, flavors are there and service was always exceptional.  Would definitely recommend."
10/18/2020,1,Terrible communication and timing. They said it would take 50 min to prep and receive food. Waiting over 1.5 hours now. Order from somewhere else if you want to receive your food before midnight
5/3/2020,5,Ordered for pickup. Perfectly & quickly pulled together our order. Very clean & beautiful presentation-even in takeaway containers. Everything was very fresh. We were very pleased & will definitely order from them again.
5/18/2019,4,"If you're looking for a quick Asian meal this is a good place to check out. They offer bento boxes, rice bowl, poke and sushi. The wait was 10-15 minutes if you're dining in which isn't bad. I had the red curry bento box and it was pretty good. If I'm ever in the mood for a quick Asian bite I'd come pay them a visit."
4/20/2019,1,They ran out of tofu which left us with no options. Didnt apologize at all. Wont go back.
5/11/2019,5,Food was hot and delicious and staff were very polite. Restaurant and patrons were very clean. I was a bit upset that they didn't have the pork ramen but I understand that it's a seasonal item. I opted for the bento box which was a decent amount of food. I also got a Lychee soda that had a marble inside. Apparently it's some kind of Japanese drink. It was quite interesting.
9/11/2019,1,"Horrible service! Food is not like any other Bento I've ever been to!The first 2 times I ate the bowls here, I had to throw them away; the sauce was pasty and thick. The 3rd time, the sushi tasted bad. The 4th time, our order was messed up and the ""replacement"" was not what we paid for. I will never return to this location again. Just plain terrible!"
4/15/2019,3,"I like the food but the service is okay! We usually order and the kids taking order either don't get it correct or forget and ask multiple times. My BIGGEST negative is that despite phone order to pick up, one has to wait in line to pick it up. What's the point of ordering 20 min ahead? Your location is busy so just make a separate counter for pick-up!"
8/28/2019,5,Nice place in the winter park area. Stopped in for a small dinner and enjoyed every bit of my food. I would like to try other menu Items next time. So many things sounded so good on the menu. Great for lunch or a quick dinner.
4/27/2019,4,"Bento was a very pleasant surprise for us! We had never been to one before...the meats were all excellent - tender, juicy and not fatty. The noodles, rice, & sides were done right and quite tasty! The garlic edamame was addictive (please note - it is very garlicky!) and I can't wait to get more of that! Taking our orders was a little slow as they only had 1 person doing so with 10-15 people in line. However, the care by the runners was excellent and better than I would expect from an order at the counter restaurant."
3/14/2019,1,Warning if you are a vegetarian. They cook their tofu in the same grease as their meat. Couldn't get a hot meal with tofu because of this. Very disappointed.
1/11/2019,5,Bento is seriously the best sushi deal in town. It's delicious and affordable and always good!
1/9/2019,5,My first time here and I want to come back. I had a noodle bowl and it was delicious. My buddies tried other dishes and they liked them too.
3/2/2019,1,"We have been going to the downtown location for almost 10 years and have never had a bad experience so we were extremely excited when this (closer to home) location opened. What a disappointment!!! It felt way too much like fast food. We had to stand in line to order (unlike downtown where you sit down and have a server) then our food came out piece meal. The garlic edamame tasted like burnt garlic and by the time we got our sushi, it was cold (we always order rolls that come with hot/warm toppings-volcano roll, etc). We will never go back to this location. From now on, we will only go the the downtown location."
3/24/2019,5,"This is my fave quick sushi spot. They allow you to do half rolls , which most places won't let you do this. This allows you to experiment with new tastes and fish. This is my go to sushi spot."
11/11/2019,5,"Can't go wrong here! Consistently good and I just ordered take out this time and the food is soo freaking hot it's unbelievable! I came home and left the bag sitting for at least 30 min while I was cleaning around / messing with the dogs and when I finally sat to eat, the food was still steaming! Five stars just for that"
12/20/2018,2,"Just another overpriced, underwhelming, fast casual restaurant. Cheap napkins, plastic flatware - at this price point? Another reviewer mentioned being nickel and dimed to death - it's true. Food was ok, but there are much better choices out there."
2/6/2019,5,"Nicole and Jervane were both amazing when it came to ordering. I placed a togo order and my card caused their system to glitch. They quickly remedied the situation to provide an overall great experience. Teamwork like that makes me happy to visit this Bento until the E. Colonial one opens up! Besides the service, the food was AMAZING as always!"
12/30/2018,5,"Lovvvvvve this new Asian spot! I tried it twice - first time I got chicken pad Thai and the second I got the Orange Chicken bento box. Both were delicious and perfectly portioned. It's cool that there's a place where I can get Chinese, Japanese, and Thai food all in one, including boba tea - the Thai tea is AMAZING by the way!Make sure to try this place - probably my next go-to for quick sushi!"
8/21/2019,3,"Pretty good and fairly affordable.  Been here twice.  Today however,  not so happy.  Ordered from their regular menu, 2 - Hawaiian bowls.  It is 1:20PM on a Wednesday......out of lettuce, they have enough 1 bowl.  Really? Lunch crowd and out of primary ingredients.  They offered to use 1/2 portions in each.  I asked to the balance of the shortage made up with  other vegetables and fruit (not asking for double tuna).  Denied. Offered noodles or rice, which is what we were trying to avoid.  Long story short.  They were kind enough the refund price of one bowl, making 1.  BUT, they kept the full 15% tip from the complete order.  Shows a level of short sightedness and poor customer service I hope doesn't transfer into their food which usually good."
2/28/2019,1,"Service has attitude problems. Food is greasy. Also, the vegetables look and taste like the ones you buy frozen at the grocery store. It definitely isn't fresh. I don't recommend this place."
1/1/2019,5,I have been going to the UCF location for a while now and very happy they opened a Winter Park location which is closer to me. Very elegant and simple decor and prompt service. Tried rice with Thai red curry sauce and spring rolls with miso soup. Everything tasted great. Others I my group tried the Mangolian and spicy Korean dishes. Additional sauces are great because I like my dishes a bit soggy. Would visit again and highly recommend this place.
4/29/2019,2,No one has a smile on their face working here and they ran out of a lot of food. Not good customer service.
8/23/2019,3,Overall a good place to eat at. Only concern is different meals coming out at different times even though it was on one tab.
4/24/2019,5,Regularly go here for sushi and Japanese food. I recommend the pao pao chicken noodle bowl and the special Mexican roll!  Very good! Fresh!
6/3/2019,5,This is like a upscale fast food restaurant. They have a good selection for sushi and food from the kitchen. They do have happy hour for sushi which I have not had yet but I was told that they do. They have poke bowls as well. The food is fresh and tastes great! This is a good spot for when your craving good sushi or just good Asian food. They also have more than one location.
2/22/2019,5,"Came back tonight...portion sizes were good/right again, and everything delicious.  WOOT WOOT!!!"
12/10/2018,3,"There are multiple locations but I will say the one on orange ave downtown is by far the best one! They not only nickel and dime you for everything @ this location (sauces, sushi toppings, etc) the food quality and taste are probably at most a 4/10."
1/24/2019,5,Themis place was awesome!  The restaurant itself was clean and well kept. Ordering was easy and quick. I was ordering take out and my food was brought to me within a few minutes. It was during the lunchtime rush which made it even better. The menu was easy to understand with many options. The food was exceptional. I will definitely be back!
1/26/2019,4,"I typically go for the Hawaiian poke bowl. Fresh and tasty! The only reason for 4 stars is that they haven't quite got the ordering down. Sometimes they try to charge me for ponzu sauce, other times they just give it to me for free. ???"
