12/9/2022,5,Love their poke bowl. I sometimes prefer it over sushi because not too much seaweed but my fave all time of their sushi roll is hot lava. It has all my fave toppings in it. Really recommend for lunch or dinner when catching up with a friend or small gatherings
11/15/2022,3,"Went here with some friends from out of town the other weekend. Our experience was... average? I've settled on ""average"" for 3 main reasons: 1. The service was fairly slow despite us being one of two sets of guests in the restaurant. 2. Our food was good, but for the price, could have been better. 3. Our meal was interrupted constantly by blaring music. Don't get me wrong, I love ""Man in the Mirror"" just as much as the next guy, but when my friends and I are having to yell over the music to communicate, that's when it becomes overbearing. It sounds like such a silly detail, but when you can't hear your friends and then eat quickly so you can leave and go somewhere quieter, it becomes a little less silly.All in all, our experience wasn't bad. This is a new and very clean location. Our food came out hot and tasted as you'd expect for a Bento. Nothing really wowed us, but that's not to say we wouldn't come back. Although, next time we might decide to drive to the Town Center Mall location instead."
9/16/2022,1,"9-16-2022 *UPDATE*Apparently they no longer have udon soup as an option here. This was the only saving grace since the sushi is so generic. Now, I won't be back at all. Thanks for ruining the closest place I could get udon soup at."
12/4/2022,3,"Great food. Okay service, no one was there. Clean and quiet ambiance was laid back. I came during closing time and the online order said they were out of general Taos. When I came inside they actually had it on the menu. Wait time was short. Wouldve liked to try the bubble tea,  but the young lady said they were out. I would come back again!"
12/21/2022,3,"This used to be a go to for me in college. While the menu is essentially the same, I unfortunately didnt find my food to be that way. When we ordered our food they told us it will take 30 min which would be fine, but it wasn't unusually busy. I ordered a bento box and the chicken was just ok."
3/20/2021,5,Can't go wrong with a Bento Box. Bentos was my first real experience in a BOX at their first location. Their second RED was a upscale of what I already loved but with a cocktail on the side. Bentos Riverside is visually welcoming. The same great food and Boxes. Menu is very accommodating to all pallettes The soft opening was professionally handled with no wait or issues. Do I wish it was a Red.. yes but they are here in my area now so that's a celebration! See you again at my lunch times soon!
3/8/2021,4,"This particular location of Bento Asian Kitchen and Sushi is located on Riverside Drive in the Brooklyn Plaza. They have a sign stating that they are in soft opening at this time. If you have ever had been towed Asian Kitchen and Sushi before, you will know that it is a decently priced alternative to get some decent Sushi and they have very good poke bowls.There are a lot of restaurants around this establishment, so they might have some stiff competition. However, there are also a lot of apartments right behind them. If you are unsure and how to find them they are located next to the Chop Barbershop and the Chipotle. All in all, I would recommend this establishment. I will advise you though that they are currently in a cashless operation, so make sure you have a debit card or a credit card."
4/6/2022,2,"I've eaten at the Gainesville and Town Center locations numerous times and the food was always great but this location the food is just ""off."" Considering Bento is a chain, I assumed the food would be the same at every location i.e. same recipes, flavor, etc. but that was not the case. I had the fried rice here and it was terrible. So mushy and very weird flavors. Not like fried rice at all or anything like what I've received at the other locations. If you want Bento I would recommend you go to a different location if possible."
5/1/2022,5,Bento box has good fried rice and tasty meat. Loved it!  Wow wow wow wow!  Go see for yourself. The service is great too.
2/20/2022,1,"I'm sorry guys. I walked in here and there were 4 people. I waited for 52 mins for a Togo of the pao pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and a ginger salad. It's good, it always is. I watched the restaurant gradually go from 3 people to 16 before anyone got food (aside from online orders). Do yourself a favor and hit up the other location in jax. Maybe drive to the one in Gainesville, you still might get your food quicker."
11/2/2021,1,"Ordered delivery. She got a poki bowl, I got red curry shrimp with extra vegetables and brown rice. Delivery guy had to give it to me gingerly because the food had leaked in the bag & the bottom had busted. Her bowl was good. Mine? Where do I begin? I thought I ordered red curry with shrimp & extra vegetables but I got a salad with 5 shrimp that had no flavor, my veggies were cooked just enough to knock the chill off of them. All the vegetables were completely raw.(bell pepper, green beans, carrots, mushrooms and broccoli) I thought maybe the curry sauce would be at the bottom with the rice but alas, no. Maybe a spoonful of curry sauce. Not even enough to make my nose run. After complaining to DoorDash they took $8 off of the $15 I paid. So I'm good from ordering again, because truthfully I'm worried the shrimp are going to make me sick being it was all raw..."
11/10/2021,2,"the staff was alright but the food took over 20 mins to come out. I was in a time-limited situation to make it to my therapy session. The divorce is hitting hard so i WAS NOT satisfied with this meal. 2/5 stars. Also the edamame(green beans) were just bland :(. sad face on the prices too, pretty expensive."
5/27/2021,5,"I have had Bento before from other locations but this was my first time trying the food at this one. I ordered a catering order for my graduation party and they didn't disappoint! We got the spicy cream chicken (it's called the Pao Pao now), lo mein, orange tofu, and krab wonton platters. The chicken and tofu platters also came with rice. The portions are huge! We ordered for 11 people originally but I had about 16 attend my graduation party and there were plenty of leftovers. We paid $254 for the whole order (but also make sure you tip for the catering orders too). You can see the portion sizes in the attached pictures. The egg rolls were not part of the catering order as my mom made those. For the food review: the spicy cream chicken and krab wontons are my favorite. The orange tofu was just ok, a little too sweet but we ordered it since the majority of my family is vegetarian. Thank you Bento Riverside! We were happy to be your first catering order!"
7/26/2022,2,Kitchen is very slow. Noodles were over cooked. No cell reception and no Wi-Fi. Overall an unpleasant experience
11/15/2021,1,"I'm a huge fan of Bento. I've been to every Bento we have in Jacksonville, and even visited the Orlando location when I've been traveling through. I have tried almost everything on the menu and am always impressed with the sushi, poke bowls, noodle bowls, and bento boxes. Really, the food is the only thing redeeming about this location.As someone who has been to multiple locations, I've noticed each place is a little different depending on their work culture. Some have great service, some just have okay service. This Bento, however, is the worst service. Staff was rude, I waited thirty minutes for my to-go noodle bowl, and when I realized other people after me in large parties were getting their food, I asked about my order. Staff cold-shouldered me and just said they were short-staffed. I completely understand that right now, more than ever, staff is hard to find. I am totally patient. But when you are rude and impatient with me for asking a polite question, I am immediately turned off. I finally gave up and asked for a refund, and was treated with more attitude. A manager came out, did not speak to me, did not apologize, did not ask me what happened, and just said ""put your card in"" and walked away. I will not be returning to this location."
6/28/2021,2,"I've had the town center one plenty of times no issues. But this one is a little off. The TNT roll is made super weird there, the texture is way off. It's gummy and mushy. Tried to show example in picture. The Mt. Fuji is the same though. Great as always"
11/11/2021,3,"I want it to be good! It just isn't. The food is just okay. It's fast and convenient, but expensive and mediocre."
4/12/2021,5,Went in this little spot for lunch today and it was pretty awesome. The food is hot a fresh and they give you plenty. I had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp as my protein. It was super yummy! I can't wait to try more of what they have to offer!
3/19/2021,5,"Finally ordered lunch to go from the newest Bento location in Brooklyn. I called in and placed my order very easily. The woman I spoke with answered any questions I had and helped my coworker and I choose the best bang for our buck. Parking is MUCH easier now with the new parking lot addition. I went around 12:30 pm and there was at least a handful of empty parking spots. They let me split the order in person and pay separately, then it was only a 5 minute wait or so for our food. The inside is super cute with plenty of natural light and fresh atmosphere. I particularly love the cute neon sign! My Sushi Combo box was delicious and filling, and cost about $12. I definitely plan on adding Bento to my lunch rotation!"
4/11/2022,1,"Total disappointment. Thought this place was ""fast casual"" so went for lunch between meetings and after 30 minutes asked where the order was and was told ten MORE minutes (!!). Five minutes later, my CHICKEN came to the table COLD. Thanks for the $17 refund, but I'll never walk back in this place."
4/19/2021,3,The manager contacted me and resolved the issue. However the issue was as you can see in the picture I ordered lo mein and received white rice. Make sure if you order to go you check your order before you go.
7/27/2021,5,"We walked in right before they were closing and everyone was so friendly and so gracious and so welcoming. While they may have been out of a handful of items, the staff really did a great job providing us with our options and we found something everyone liked. The Bento box and sushi rolls were excellent.  Spring rolls and tempura shrimp also fresh and excellent. Loved it and will be back but the staff deserves a raise and maybe some bonuses."
10/16/2021,2,"Employees were nice, but overall the experience was 1.5 stars mainly based on the quality of food - which was just ehh okay - I asked for ""plain"" fried rice for our two young kids (also $7?!) the employees must have misunderstood when I said plain and no egg, they still Included all The vegetables. The kiddos didn't want to waste their time exchanging it. Also ordered the bento box general tso and the portions for $15 was not worth it, small scoop of rice? Fewer pieces of general tso chicken  and lo mein noodles with no flavor SMH. The last items We ordered was the $15 special roll 'hot lava' and Mex roll- let's just say both rolls for the price and quality were very underwhelming and we're not crafted the way a sushi roll is supposed toBe made...and Bento isn't new to us we've been going since they opened in town center area (but have been going less and less since the pandemic, bento red turned to shit too) this fairly new riverside location need some work..also we had to clean our own tables with soy sauce stains on it, I may not be a professional restaurant manager but I'm a customer that observes all the details. Step up on the experience and the prices are way toooo high for the quality! We love to supportBut won't be going back anytime soon!"
10/31/2021,1,"Closes early always. I get it it's COVID but then when I get to the place on a night you don't close early y'all are all just hanging out not trying to work. No wonder this place will be out of business in a year. Ran out of lo mien after I already paid for my food and asked if I wanted something for free... I said no white rice was fine, and then you proceeded to not bring our tea for another 15 min while we eat half of what we ""ordered"" . Y'all are trash. Fire the whole squad"
4/3/2022,3,Head off to whoever cook my food it's delicious lol  hello to the Lang lady at the counter she needs to start smiling more when someone asked her for a condiment she made me feel like I don't know what I'm talking about a restaurant like this place with out salad sauce or condiments for your green salad that's ridiculous. She seems like I bothered hard when I Astor for a sauce for my salad really you work on this place specially an Asian place like this you need to start smiling first every Asian is not nice like me. The lady that serve my food thank you so much is served with smile and again thank you for the cook made my food it's amazing thank you all ready
6/5/2021,5,"I had the chicken katsu and my mom had a poke bowl which was bussin bussin :) their boba is good too! I don't like the paper straw though, since I drink slow I end up with soggy straw. I bought a metal one though so I'll use that from now on."
2/28/2021,4,"The atmosphere leaves a little to be desired. The employees are bordering on rude but the food is good and prices are fair. I ordered the chicken fried rice and was told that they were out of bean sprouts, I asked if I could remove the peas and there was some kind of failure to communicate as it took her 5 min to explain that the carrots and peas come together? So I opted to get them as the only vegtables in the fried rice. I did ask if I could substitute peppers or another vegetable for the bean sprouts and was told I would habe to pay extra. I almost walked out, and if my son hadn't brought me, I would have. But I was pleased with my dish."
10/17/2021,1,Staff is rude & by the way - it's a sushi place that when busy won't serve sushi...or so we were just told. Poor excuse for a Bento!
5/15/2021,2,"The cafe was sparkling, new and inviting. The counter help was very informative and answered all of my questions. We ordered a large variety of food that was not too overpriced priced if it was all edible. The noodle soup only tasted of fish oil, the California roll was definitely not fresh as it was gummy in the center. Our foods came to us in very small amounts as the first person was done before the last one was served. We were not given an explanation as to why this happened. The Mongolian shrimp was excellent but small for the price. I think this will be a good cafe once they get their staff to work together but they are not there yet."
3/24/2021,3,"The ambiance of the restaurant is great except we got dark meat in all our bowls. Panda Express carries all white meat and this being a high class Asian restaurant, I expected white meat but it came with dark meat by default. Also the rice is a little mushy and doesn't look fully fried. Taste is good and that is why I gave three stars. Need some cooking improvement."
5/24/2021,5,"Delicious food, healthy and light. Large portions and good variety of options. I like the pok'e bowl, good value and super yum."
3/11/2021,5,Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi is my daughter's favorite place to eat dinner. I tried their poke bowl the last when I went there and it was DELICIOUS. Made me so happy and full. Highly recommend this place for poke bowl.
5/15/2020,4,"Many time visitor - first door dash- The make your own poke bowl is my favorite. I ordered a different one for each family member through door dash. Perfectly and accurately made with a side of delicious veggie spring rolls. They made them visually appealing and ingredients were crisp, fresh, and delicious. Door dash was fast and friendly"
5/12/2021,2,"I was pretty disappointed after finally trying this new Bento location. It has been a couple years since I've had Bento and I liked it when I did. Tonight I drove into Brooklyn and ordered. The staff was friendly and attentive, the food came out fairly quickly and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice. My issue was the food. I got two chicken bento boxes (Mongolian and garlic broccoli), krab wontons and a Thai tea. All together it was $40!!!! The chicken was bland - both flavors tasted the exact same. The whole entire box tasted like frozen pre packaged food you buy at the store and defrost in a pan. The Thai tea was overly sweet with a bitter after taste and I couldn't take more than two sips. The wontons were good but you only get 4 for $5.50 and they barely had any filling. All in all I'm upset I paid $40 for such mediocre food. You can get twice the amount of food for the same price at our favorite Chinese take out and the food is 10 times better."
9/17/2021,1,"While I understand that many businesses are suffering because of the COVID-19 outbreaks and there are staff shortages, it seems like management would have the foresight to do some very simple things like putting a small board up every day to let customers know that they are out of certain dishes. Of the dishes that I tried to order, they were out of yellow curry, brown rice, and sushi in any form. When I finally decided on a Bento box with beef they took the order and then in about 10 minutes came out to tell me that they were also out of beef! When I asked for a manager they couldn't seem to find one and I explained that it would be good if the customers knew what they were out of ahead of time - less stress for everyone all the way around. Additionally, even though they ask everyone to wear a mask until they get to the table the person who took the order had no mask and many of the staff had their mask under their chin. If you're going to ask customers to wear a mask, the staff should be setting an example. The response to my concern was simply ""I'll let my manager know"". It would also be helpful if they just had a coupon of some sort to offer customers when their experience is not that great. Beautiful setting and beautiful interior, but at this point would not come back to this restaurant."
4/4/2021,4,"Overall the food is good. Be prepared with a debit/credit card as they do not take cash. I've been here 3 times now since they've opened. 2 of those 3, the sushi rolls I ordered, fell apart while trying to eat them. The taste was still good tho."
3/21/2021,3,"I ordered the combo box and the crab wontons to be delivered. The wontons were still crispy and quite good.  I ordered a chicken tempura and a Florida. I expected the 4 pieces of tempura to be crispy, but they put the chicken inside a seaweed and rice roll. Not at all crispy! Also,  I didn't know that the Florida roll would have raw fish.  The menu doesn't specify what's in the rolls. So, because I'm home sick,  I didn't eat it. The California roll that's included was ok."
11/22/2022,4,"I was looking for something to eat after shopping at REI and noticed this place. With tofu on the menu, it was a go. You order at the counter and place a number on the table, to have your food delivered to you. It was fast and friendly, and the food was hot and delicious. The place was casual and seemed to be a popular spot for takeout."
8/3/2022,2,"Food was good, but the service and prices ruined this experience. For two people, two dishes and two fountain drinks came out to $35. This was after my boyfriend noticed that he had been charged an additional fee for a shrimp tempura that we did not order and received a refund. The server that handled the refund was not entirely polite and rolled her eyes when he made a simple inquiry about the receipt. Not a great first impression for us with this location.Food took quite a bit of time to arrive but tasted good. May or may not return to this location to see if they have improved any."
12/22/2022,5,"Bento Asian Kitchen was one of the best restaurants we've ever ate at. The food was delicious, and everything was very clean. We would go to Bento 100 more times if we wanted to. The service was quick, and didn't last over 12 minutes. Bento is a 5 star restaurant to us."
4/20/2022,4,"Bento wasn't my first choice, but I needed something quick and convenient between running errands and yoga.Food wasn't bad, just average. It's your typical Asian chain restaurant, so I wasn't expecting anything great. The boba menu is basic, but the jasmine tea was pretty decent. I ordered a veggie roll with a side of eel sauce, which was packaged nicely and affordable, but vastly underwhelming.There are a few other Japanese places across the street I would recommend over this."
3/21/2022,5,"Anytime I'm hungry at Town Center it's a hard sell NOT to go to this place. I love it! The customizable poke bowls hit your fancy no matter what you're craving- Mango, pineapple, edamame, seaweed salad, avocado. Can't decide between rice and salad? Go for both! The salmon is delicious and the spicy tuna will clear out your sinuses. (Read: it's good!) The sauce options are fantastic too, I really like the Yuzu ponzu. It's a little expensive but the portions are large. And they have a nice selection of boba teas, I recommend the Thai boba. Yum!"
12/25/2022,3,"The service was slow. They always have missing menu items. This time was the sweet and sour sauce for the fried wantons. They did no tell us. We just received them late with no sauce. They run out of padtai  and food came slowly. Should they have big to go orders , then you are not told but you may be waiting more than 25 minutes for your order. Corporate should supervise the town center restaurant. They are not train for good and efficient service. It has got worse as weeks go by. Sorry you lost a frequent customer"
7/29/2022,4,"Bento's been around for quite a few years now. The craze had died down awhile now too but this place pretty much still serves the same menu. It still tastes the same way, which is a good thing. Service is still great and staff are still friendly."
11/21/2022,5,"Top tier team at this location. Their efficiency, and kindness is beyond appreciated. There are shortages creating menu holes but they are working with the concern with grace and ease"
6/18/2022,5,"This is my go-to place almost every Sunday after church and as always, I have been consistently getting good service and quality food! I am a little bit confused about reviews who say otherwise. Everytime I am craving for sushi, I go to this place and my cravings are satisfied. We went here tonight for dinner with the fam and perfect timing because it is national sushi day where we can get free sushi when ordering $10 or more. Tonight I ordered volcano roll and my son ordered Mt.Fuji roll. For our free sushi, we got the spicy tuna roll - all of these are super delicious!!!"
11/21/2022,2,"Went to lunch there and the Sushi was fine, I would even recommend it (especially the special mex roll). The staff on the other hand was the exact opposite. Very rude and short with all their customers even though they were not busy. Most the employees were standing around not doing much. They were not helpful either when asking questions about the menu. I would recommend going to Bento, but not this location."
11/13/2022,2,"The quality of this place has decreased significantly since it opened, making me wonder if it has changed owners. My food ended up taking 20+ minutes to arrive, even though the place wasn't very busy. The rice was at room temperature when it got to the table, and the meal itself was only somewhat warm. The tables were also dirty. I watched the staff clean a used table, using a pre-used white rag, with a couple sprays. There was food residue left on that table, and frankly speaking, there was food residue left on all of the tables. Gross. I feel like the staff now does the minimum here, and it shows in the food and atmosphere. My wife felt the similar about her entree - acceptable, but nothing to go back for. We won't be coming back."
10/13/2022,3,Bento has really gone downhill the past year. Came to this location since the riverside location doesn't have udon noodle soup anymore. The cashier must have not paid attention because both my udon noodle soup and my friends were wrong. I asked for no Bok Choy and Wakame. Mine came with bok choy so they had to fix it. My friend asked for plain noodles since they were out of katsu chicken and he doesn't eat tofu or shrimp. He added a combo with coke and an egg roll They were also out of the Dragon Fruit Lemonade even though they still had a sign up for it. So I just had water and ginger salad for my conbo. I let a team member know and she brought mine back out and it was fine. She said there were problems with the particular cashier who took our order and offered to refund my friend when they were finished with their food. It's sad to say I probably won't be back to either location in the future. There's not many noodle places in town so I go where I can.
2/20/2022,1,"Bento disappoints once again! After waiting 30 minutes, they gave us our food with 1 item less. We asked for it and got it. But when we got home, the tofu katsu was replaced with a chicken katsu (see receipt). I CANNOT eat chicken. So I'm starving and have to cook.One day I'll learn my lesson and never go back. Unfortunately, I've friends who like their food. Oh, when we tried calling, no one picks up the phone. Twice."
9/30/2022,5,"We are here on business for three weeks and decided to check out the Bentos , which is one of our hometown favorites! We had dinner this week and we're impressed with the freshness and great taste of the sushi! We had the dragon roll and it was delicious! We will definitely have sushi there again."
10/23/2022,5,"My favorite quick service sushi restaurant, the sushi and poke bowls are phenomenal and the ingredients are always fresh. The service is always quick and friendly."
9/4/2022,1,The service is super suck!!!!!!!! And the price is too pricey. Is not worth the money cuz the food is suck.
12/22/2021,3,"This was my first time here. It was a cold rainy night so I wanted ramen. Except they don't serve ramen here, only udon noodle which was just 2 pieces of bok choy and udon noodle. You can pick a protein but they ran out of chicken and shrimp so I got a side of tofu which sounded good in theory. I thought the tofu would be in the soup but instead it was fried tofu with no seasoning or flavor or dipping sauce. Now I can see why Americans don't like tofu because it's not prepared correctly at Asian fusion places. The inside doesn't seem very clean and the service was a bit rude. Would not be back."
10/26/2022,2,Ran out of a bunch of stuff and offered no alternatives. Not very friendly. Hopefully the food is better than the service!
4/5/2021,1,"Ordered my meal at 4:15pm. Not a real busy time period. Order a Bowl with Udon, shrimp, General Tso style. 20 minutes later a man stopped by and asked if the manager had been by my table yet. I told him, no. I said that they were out of ""the sauce"" to make my meal, would I like something else. He asked if I wanted something hot or sweet. I told him medium, and I told him I would be happy with any bowl, with Udon, and shrimp. 28 minutes later, I received a bowl. It was a bowl with Udon, and fried chicken with hot sauce. 48 total minutes of waiting and not the right food. A little while later, I see him pointing at me to another man who I thought was likely the manager. That man looked at me and I asked him to stop by. He stopped by and I explained things to him. ""Is there something I can get you"", was his question. I said, no, I just thought he should know. He asked if I wanted what I ordered to take home. I said, no. He then left the table. Now... in my world a restaurant manager, owner, person in charge would invite me back on them due to their total ""blowing it"" with my visit. Many time in my past life, I would have refunded their money and invited them back, No... too busy wanting to go over and talk to the other man again. So... some years ago this was one of my ""go to"" places to eat lunch. I must have gone there at least 50 times. After today's today, ""who gives a XXX"" experience, they are now off the list for the future.Now, don't come crying back to me about you might have hiring issues now (their kitchen appeared fully staffed)... because an honest ""I'm sorry and let me invite you back as my guest"" would have turned the situation around. There are simply too many options to have to deal with situations like this... so I will choose not to. Really bad experience... really doesn't deserve the one star. Oh yeah, their drink machine was out of order too. Good bye!!"
5/7/2020,4,"This was my first time trying this place, my mom loves it here so it came highly recommended. We had a poke bowl, Miami roll but I wanted it panko fried and crab wontons, everything was delicious. No complaints! These 3 items came out to $31, but it honestly was quality food, tasty and good portions. Right now due to covid, only outside and take out is available. Can't wait to try some more food off their menu. I was so excited when I saw they offered Japanese white sauce as one of the sauces, yesssssss!!!!"
2/7/2022,1,"Poorly packaged food spilled all over my wifes car. The lids must not have been snapped shut, because these types of containers are usually hard to open. Also, an entire family meal (4 rice bowls and 4 soups) was jammed into one bag... Seperate into two bags and this probably wouldn't have happened.Also, two customers in front of us walked out before ordering because it smelled like sewage. Probably mopping the floors with the rugs down."
2/19/2021,5,"The food is good - but they made a mistake on the order, ya know because they are human! Let's take a chill pill people sometimes mistakes are made - it's what you do with that error that makes a difference. They definitely made it right with sincerity and also comped an appetizer! It gets busy so plan accordingly, and be prepared to wait for sushi"
3/12/2022,5,"Food was delicious the place is beautifully decorated. We were served fast on a Saturday afternoon for dinner. The drinks were very good, my sons got the boba tea. The enrolls (2 per order) super crispy with a sweet and tangy sauce."
12/7/2020,2,I went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was ok. It wasn't amazing but it was not bad either. I asked for it to be spicy and it really wasn't. The lomein noodles were cold and salad dressing wasn't enough for salad. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
9/5/2022,1,I had the chicken katsu and the chicken tasted fake. I've been coming to bento for 2 years and I always get the chicken katsu. Either it was over cooked or something but this is the first time I've had it taste like that. Horrible! And the young lady working at the register wasn't really nice. Food was rly slow to come out too
4/2/2022,3,"Ok. So I usually always get a Bento Box at Bentos and it is always delicious. As of late everything is coming out hot in there Bento Boxes which was not the case a few months back. Anyways, instead of ordering a bento or eating udon soup at my favorite place (Soupa) I decided to try it at Bento. And I have to say that was a mistake! Please don't bother ordering the udon soup at Bento. Stick to eating there bento boxes which are great. Go to Soupa for the udon soup."
10/27/2019,4,"Visited Bento at St. John's Town Center at about 6:30pm on Sunday. There was a small line to order but it moved fast.  After we ordered, the line behind us began to build. Bento serves many different Asian Dishes as well as Sushi. Their Main Menu is set up by picking a base of Rice Bowl, Noodle Bowl, or Bento Box. You then pick one of the many Asian prepared protein options. They also have set dishes and Soups. We ordered the following:Spicy Bulgogi Bento Box with Brown RiceSweet & Sour Chicken Lo Mein Noodle BowlOrange Chicken Lo Mein Noodle BowlHibachi Steak Rice BowlAfter ordering we took our order number to our table. The food didn't take too long to come out. Everything was tasty and filling. The beef was tender and flavorful and the chicken bowls had a nice tang and zest. Depending on your appetite, some of the dishes could be shareable as they are decent portions for the price. Tip:  You get one complimentary sauce per roll, bowl, or box. The white sauce was our favorite (which is the same as Shrimp/Yum Yum sauce from Japanese Hibachi Steakhouses)."
4/15/2022,1,Don't order to go without checking your food. I ordered the sweet and sour shrimp bowl with lo mein to go and it was trash. I would have taken it back if I had the energy to deal with them. The shrimp were literally 1/2 an inch long and COVERED in breading and sauce so it looks like a decent size. Not what I was hoping for at all especially for the price. Shrimp also had the tail attached under the breading so you can't even tell until you're eating something crunchy. Noodles were greasy. Yuck.
3/19/2022,2,"Food was fine, but overpriced for what we received. $15 for a sushi roll you could get elsewhere at the same quality for much less. No complaint about service."
4/22/2022,2,"I always order the Pao Pao™ Rice Bowl which is delicious even though I normally like spicy dishes. so this time I ordered the  Sichuan Rice Bowl which I realize now, it's not spicy either but, it doesn't taste good, it's not seasoned, there's very little chicken and veggies, it's just like eating cardboard. This place it's a one pony deal to me now, I won't venture to other dishes as now I'm afraid it will be bland and flavorless, to think I paid $12 for this! I was hungry so, have to shove in tasteless rice to fill up."
3/14/2022,1,The food so expensive for something so mediocre. The rice was under cooked and the chicken over cooked. I will bet a couple bucks that Panda Express is better than bento. And at this bento location the staff are so rude and gave me attitude about ordering. Live laugh love.
11/14/2021,2,I really hope their kitchen is cleaner than the dining room.... Almost walked out due to the level of filth. We were the first ones in the restaurant at 11am and it was obvious they didn't clean the dining room for the day. The food was good but I'm concerned about the food safety that is observed in the back. We won't be back.
5/20/2019,4,"I was craving poke and this place is conveniently located close to work. I called in my to go order to minimize my wait. Arriving just before noon, the place was relatively full. My poke of white rice, chicken katsu, tempura shrimp, and spicy tuna was good. For toppings I chose edamame, sautéed shiitake mushrooms, masago, and avocado. I also added furikake and scallions along with spicy mayo and poke soy for my 2 sauces. The place filled the bill for my craving and would easily add this to my regular lunch rotation easily to shake things up from the norm."
2/20/2021,5,I ordered the volcano sushi roll. It was absolutely delicious. Place is clean and you're greeted upon arrival. Taking proper social distancing and cleaning measures. Food never disappoints.
11/21/2021,4,"I like the protein bowls.  Never had an issue with service and have always eaten outside, so can't speak to the cleanliness of the indoor eating area.  It's definitely a good fast-casual option for me if I'm the area."
2/17/2020,4,"Bento has been one of my favorites since I moved to Jacksonville 7 years ago. I've always loved there fast service, expansive menu and delicious food (that is always fresh.)It is definitely one of the places that I could eat everyday if I allowed myself to! I often get their build your own poke bowl. The ingredients are fresh, the rice is cooked well and the sauces are on point. I wouldn't say they are the best poke bowl in the area as they aren't as generous with their servings of proteins and you don't have unlimited topping options like Kazu and some of the other similar style restaurants for the price point. But you are guaranteed to be served a meal with quality ingredients. I love this location as it has very large windows that allow you to see the beautiful outdoors. The staff are friendly and it's very clean!Definitely a place to check out if you love sushi!"
6/29/2022,5,"The food tastes great!!!  The staff are friendly and helpful, I love the way that your lunch is packaged!!!"
6/14/2022,1,"Can I give zero stars? Placed an order online and showed up to pick up my order for everyone to just stare at me when I walk in and stand at the counter. Then I am told that my order will be a few minutes, no problem I was a little early. I am headed my order a few minutes later and ask for two shrimp sauces and I'm told that they have to charge me on top of already paying quite a bit for a chain restaurants food for a sauce that for the last four years has always come complementary one with each entrée. Destiny was extremely rude and un-interested in helping me. On top of that, get home... Food was absolutely disgusting. Tasted like it was from the day before"
6/3/2022,1,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars, I really do. From the  workers who don't speak to you no to them not having anything you want in stock half the time. So I I ordered the sesame stir fry double chicken no mushrooms. When my food arrived, there was mushrooms in it. I kindly asked if i could have a remake, they then asked if I had an allergy to mushrooms or if I just didn't want them. Who knows why that matters, regardless you have to remake my food, you served me wrong food. They then came back, with my same bowl, mushrooms picked out of it, and now the chicken is cold. I didn't even bother eating it, I just gave them back the bowl. They then asked me if I wanted a refund. No shit I want a refund. Oh and btw, they didn't give it to me."
10/15/2018,4,"This is a good, solid 4 star establishment. Asian fast food, but really nice quality. My husband and I were in the area and he decided this place sounded the best out of all the choices and I agreed. Not having been here before, we were a bit confused by the menu - not all the dishes were available with the all meat choices, but the lady behind the register was patient and explained how to read the menu, thankfully.My husband had the Asian Cajun Pork noodle bowl. The cashier warned him that it was going to be hot (spicy) and he said that was fine, it was what he wanted. I ordered the Szechuan chicken Bento box with brown rice. (I received no warning about the heat, ironically. LOL) We decided to make it a combo meal for a little extra by adding a drink and a bowl of soup. The clear soup was very good, the mushrooms were super fresh. My husband thinks that was the best clear soup he's had in a very long time. Our meals followed soon after. My husband's Asian Cajun Pork noodle bowl was very tasty, and a wee bit spicy, but did not in any way deserve the ""HOT"" warning he received. LOL We rather thought it was tame. On the other hand, my Szechuan chicken was HOT! Wow! No complaints at all, it was exactly what I wanted, but didn't expect (most places disappoint with the heat). Frankly, he was a bit envious of my dish and was scooping up the extra sauce for his noodles.With both dishes, the green beans were awesome. Seasoned well, cooked, but still with a good crunch. The noodles were good in both, al dente and flavorful. My brown rice was very nice, nutty and soft. All the vegetables were very fresh. The pork in my husband's bowl was very tasty, almost steak-like. The chicken in mine was super tender. The only ""disappointment"" was the salad in my Bento box, but it wasn't bad, just average.We did not try any sushi, but it was very popular while we were there, a lot of people sitting around us had ordered it and it looked really nice.All the workers we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The building was small, but clean. I like that the food was fresh but fast and yet was still served on proper plates. I'm glad we got there early, because by the time we were done eating, the order line was out the door!I do recommend Bento Cafe if you are in this area."
11/17/2018,4,"Ordered: pineapple fried rice with tofuThis location is slightly different from the Deer Lake location; as in it's not your traditional sit down restaurant. You preorder your food, take a number then wait for your food to be delivered to your table. Ive been here a few times and for the most part I like their cooked sushi rolls and their boba drinks. My favorites so far is the Mt. Fuji roll and the taro milk tea boba. As for their other entree items, those are hit or miss. Some really good, some kinda greasy, some kinda bland. The pineapple fried ric that I ordered this time was very flavorful minus the amount of greasy they used. However it did have generous amounts of tofu and pineapple."
11/7/2021,1,"This is not my first experience with bento, but it may well be my last. The staff at this establishment were very unprofessional while attempting to place an order. First, I was told to call back in 15 minutes just to place an order. Then, they said they ran out of rice and noodles. My final attempt to give this company my business resulted with the staff outright refusing to take any orders."
3/27/2022,1,"Terrible food and pricey. Lowest quality sushi and ""Asian food"" Ive ever had. They used to be good, not knowing what happened to them now, should just close the restaurant if the owner doesn't care anymore, let someone else who's talented and passionate about cooking to own the spot."
8/5/2020,5,Extremely well organized take out during COVID - got sushi rolls and Pao Pao Creamy Chicken bowl (think bang bang sauce at bonefish) that was outstanding
11/1/2020,1,When making orders make sure Mara M doesn't take it. She left out my order of Zombie.
5/26/2018,4,"Reasonably priced, Bento features a great menu with several asian cuisine options to choose from. This location at the town center is different from the one one in Tinseltown. The other Bento (Bento Red) is distinguished by a larger size dining area along with live music and a full bar. At this location (town center) I just pay for my food at the register when I order and pick my own seat. At the other location, you have to wait to be seated and you'll have a server assigned to you. My top recommendations:Spicy Cream Chicken- This is THE favorite dish of everyone I've gone to Bento with. Sweet, savory, creamy, and not too spicy. Just a few bell peppers to give the dish a bit of a kick! Sushi: Volcano Special - Best sushi you will ever have. It has shrimp tempura, tuna, cream cheese, avocado with ""krab"" toppings and eel sauce. It's the most beautiful sushi presented to you. Look around at other people eating their sushi and you'll see that they're drooling over yours. I have tried other dishes but these ones will definitely keep you coming back! Bento has an awesome staff too! Very friendly and quick service!"
5/17/2018,3,"I will start with:1. I don't eat sushi but do enjoy the rice bowls and some appetizers here2.  I have come here and had wonderful, quick service before (would usually rate this a 4/5) - but my most recent visit was different. Unfortunately, Today's visit wasn't the most pleasant. All employees were nice, but the service was pretty slow.  We arrived around 11:45, and the lunch rush had clearly begun. (So be sure to plan for a longer lunch if you come here.) My group ordered 4 meals to go and it took 15-20 minutes or so to get our relatively simple orders.  The tea was the worst part.  I had never tried it before, but had a craving for a nice light fruit tea.  I ordered the green tea with pineapple and waited until I got back to work to drink it.  Not sure if it was the artificial fruit mix in or the green tea itself but the tea was just plain DISGUSTING. It almost had a burnt plastic taste to it.  I was very disappointing with that, and probably won't be ordering it again.  These small issues aside, I would return here."
8/27/2019,4,AMAZING: chicken fried rice. Giant portions which means leftovers or you can share with a friend! About $9 for that is a great price. Not so great: don't bother getting Boba tea here. The boba balls are usually underdone and kinda hard in the middle. The tea itself is good just don't waste your money in the boba balls.
6/10/2020,5,"One of our favorites go to in Jacksonville when we want something quick, good and filling. We love the variety and their ever evolving menu. Sometimes one of our favorites gets taken off the menu but we never have a hard time finding a new favorite. My whole family enjoys dining here and we always try to bring our out of town guests there while they are visiting, so they can try out one of our favorite spots. Always two thumbs up from our guests as well.The only thing is sometimes the portions are not consistent."
5/9/2019,2,"Sorry we held up the line as first timers asking a bunch of questions trying to understand their menu and ordering process. My husband tried their Korean rice bowl with chicken and shrimp. He thought the Korean sauce was bland, chicken bland, and shrimp pieces small. I tried the make-your-own poke bowl with spicy tuna, on brown rice, with cucumber, avocado, wakame seaweed salad topped with furikake and spicy mayo sauce. It was meh! Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes for our first time? But we did ask what was popular, so maybe that's their best?Note: also had to use their restroom and the floor was crazy sticky and floor drain open and exposed. Gross!We've bento better."
11/8/2017,4,"I've been coming here for 5 years now and the food is still great, not too expensive and the service is quick. I like their boba tea, delicious and refreshing. The atmosphere is modern, spacious and clean. The wait used to be long during rush hour but ever since Peiwei opened, it's not as busy anymore. It's convenient because Mochi is right next door so I always stop by there after lunch here.My favorite dishes here are the Korean beef, Spicy cream chicken bento box and Fried udon noodles with shrimp."
6/12/2019,4,Love the atmosphere and the food is so good. Mad I didn't know about this place sooner. Currently hooked on the yellow curry. I always have to get extra sauce for all that rice.
4/10/2020,3,"Just ordered this with Uber Eats. I was extremely disappointed. I got the bento box with teriyaki steak. The steak was chewy, the rice was hard, and the salad had no dressing on it. I also ordered the crab Rangoon and no sauce came with it and it was overcooked. I have eaten here before inside the restaurant and it was okay, but I have to say, this time this order was disappointing."
5/10/2017,5,The Sushi in here is so good! I know it's not a fancy restaurant for fancy people who just wants to be fancy (#Fancy) But for someone who is craving sushi on her lunch break. This place is amazing! They serve you right away and you have plenty of time to enjoy your meal during your 1 hour lunch!
2/7/2017,2,"It was just OK after the last few visits.It was THE spot when I was in high school. It was a relatively new concept of having sushi in a chic spot, being seen by your friends and learning how to pronounce names of Asian food properly. They became super popular due to the quick service, easy to read menus and next to a dessert heaven. If you're a coming of age, new to Asian cuisine then by all means you will love this place. But if you're a seasoned foodie with various taste buds then you will probably deem this place underwhelming. I know I did. This is the place to take your easily impress cousin who has never tried sushi before."
12/26/2018,4,"I've really come around to Bento. I used to find it kind of overpriced and meh quality when I can go down the road to a real Japanese sushi place, but they've improved their taste in my mouth so to speak.Their fried rice is honestly really good. I think the addition of bean sprouts is a nice touch since not a lot of places do that, and they include plenty of egg which I like.They have changed the menu a lot and the build your own poke bowl options are my favorite. So is the bulgogi beef. However my go to is usually a noodle bowl with teriyaki beef or chicken on top- drenched in sauce of course.Aside from pretty high upcharges on rolls and the like (to add things like cucumber, extra sauce, etc) nothing has rubbed me the wrong way in a while haha.They also have a huge selection of milk and boba teas, if you're into that."
4/17/2021,5,"We had a great experience here! The food was very fresh and tasty! The manager Kevin, came and checked on us a few times. He was very friendly and made sure our order was correct. We will definitely be back!"
10/10/2018,4,"The food was very fresh and came out very quickly! I had actually gotten a coupon from a yelp event and I was so happy I was able to use it! I got a sushi bento box and it came with a lot of food and it was upgraded to include a miso soup and a drink. My son got a curry steak and it came with a side  salad, noodles and  seaweed salad. Also something fried with a sweet sauce over it. I dont know what it was but i ate it! it was good!! I think his was the way to go...more food! Everything was super tasty! It's nice how they come by frequently and check how your order is. Nice experience!"
7/5/2019,5,"I have come here many times and have never had a bad experience. Whether you are there for dine-in or take out, the food is always delicious. In the last week alone, I have been 3 times and always got a rice poke bowl; nice, light and refreshing option. My second favorite go-to option is the spicy cream chicken in a noodle bowl. Staff is friendly and efficient. Place is clean. This is one of our favorite places to go especially with our picky eater friends because there is something for everyone. Note: It seems to be a better deal (portion wise) to ""build your own"" poke bowl, versus one of the specialty ones. Also, (my only kinda negative opinion): While I appreciate that they have boba, they definitely could be improved upon. The flavor is always kind of off. Not terrible, but not great."
12/29/2018,5,"I was going to attach the initial presentation, but when the food came we all devoured itThe tofu was done perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.Pao Pao sauce had the perfect combo of sweet and spicyGinger Salad was average, nothing special hereLo mein was scrumptious Complimentary spicy mayo is a mustGreat Service and Excellent Food! We will definitely be coming back"
10/31/2019,1,If I can give this place a ZERO STAR I WOULD! This place is especially busy during lunch time. Food is subpar and it's more college vibe people eating here. Of course table is not clean and place always look greasy and needs a good wipe down. The steak and noodles look dry and not worth the money. Thai tea is my favorite but their version is pretty weak. Service is slow and when my food arrived the waitress told me my order has bell peppers in it and I specially told them I'm allergic to bell peppers and still serviced it and asked if it was okay... I told them I'm allergic to it and unless they want me to go to the hospital then NO! They try to rectify the issue by offering soup or salad and I gladly declined. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again!!!
6/12/2018,4,"This is the first Bento restaurant in Jacksonville (affectionately dubbed Bento Blue).  Located beside a Mochi yogurt shop, this local and Florida ""fast food"" chain was pretty hipster with its modern setting.  The restaurant is small compared to its big brother Bento Red which is a full size sit down restaurant located near Cinemark Tinseltown theaters.  Bento Blue makes up for its size with big service and a smooth ordering at the counter process before you self-seat at your booth or table.I am a fan of what Bento has dubbed ""Pan-Asian cuisine"" which includes good sushi, Japanese grilled fare, Japanese Udon/Ramen soups, Korean Beef Bulgogi as well as Filipino Lechon (roasted pork) -- these are my regular ""rotation"" of favorite dishes I order.  All so delicious!I've expanded my rotation of Bento Pan-Asian food and also love the sushi rolls, bowls, bento boxes, and boba teas!If you are looking for a nice place for Pan-Asian food in a small restaurant setting, you'll be happy you checked out Bento Blue!"
11/9/2016,5,This was my first time here and I am now so excited to visit the new location built in South Florida!The atmosphere was nice and casual. You order first and then take a seat amd a number. They will bring the food to you once it's ready. I ordered two different sushi rolls that were both great. The food was very fresh and the service quick.
6/6/2018,3,"This is my first visit to the Bento Cafe.  The place is always packed so I was curious to see what all the hype was about.   It's basically a fast food Asian/Sushi restaurant.  You place your order, get a number and your food is delivered to your table.  I was in the mood for a Bento Box and ordered the Chicken with Szechuan sauce.  The presentation is beautiful but unfortunately looks can be deceiving.  Lol.  Here is the breakdown of my Bento meal. Chicken in Szechuan sauce...chicken was very over cooked.   It tasted like it was reheated a million times.  The vegetables were fresh but the sauce was way too salty.  Low Mein noodles...cold, hard and lacked flavor. MehSalad with ginger dressing...very good.  Fresh green beans.  They were cold and there could have been more.  Very stingy with the portion.  I guess to each his own.  Just another typical, overrated fast food joint in SJTC.  Perhaps the sushi is better but I'd be weary.  If you can't give me fresh chicken how can I trust you'll give me fresh fish?  Just sayin!"
8/8/2018,5,"Business travel often affords me with unique and wonderful culinary experiences. It can, unfortunately, also have the opposite effect. So, happening into the Bento Café while working in Jacksonville, I anxiously awaited my made-to-order Poke Bowl. The atmosphere was pleasant and lively. The employees buzzing all around had welcome smiles. I couldn't help but smile back. Make no mistake, this is NOT fast food!  I waited for a good 25 minutes for my food and let me tell you that it was totally worth the wait. The ingredients not only looked fresh, but the taste was extraordinary. I noticed the orders being delivered to tables of awaiting customers and everyone appeared delighted with their orders. I even saw several people sharing bites of each other's food. It's definitely a little hot spot that is popular with the millennials, but if you're a Gen X, like myself, you will be delighted with selections and the prices.  Go ahead and give The Bento Café a try, and that folks, is all she wrote."
3/29/2021,1,"I ordered the surf and turf poke bowl and this is normally what i get once a month here but i was extremely disappointed from what i was given. No masago, barely any chicken and avocado. It just looks so messy and it didn't look appealing at all. :/ this isn't the bento service i usually get"
1/20/2020,4,The service was  good at the counter. Unfortunately they were out of several dishes. Chose the rice bowl with broccoli and chicken. It was good. Seemed a little light on the chicken and broccoli with lots of rice. Good for lunch.
2/23/2020,4,To go order if soup satisfied my palate but the lack.of knowledge displayed by staff and the drab look sent me to the next location next time.Feels like another fail on a town center location. I guess they feel like they don't have to be great.
8/18/2019,4,"Quick, casual, and very tasty! I have only had the sushi from Bento and am always pleased with what I get! It's a perfect choice when you want something quick that's not your typical fast dining experience. I love that you can get some of the rolls as a half order and that way you can try multiple flavor combos!"
1/28/2016,3,"Have to update my review to reflect the integrity of this business' management:Bento's management team did a thorough follow up after my last review and contacted me personally to apologize again and inform me that pest control was called and the restaurant serviced since. This shows how dedicated they are to customer satisfaction and quality. After much consideration and the fact that many of my friends love it here, I am willing to continue as a patron. I do love the concept of the Bento box and there is always something for every taste. Service has always been great and what can I say,  I'm a sucker for boba tea hahaCheers."
8/14/2019,5,Very nice place for Poke. Food was fresh and delicious.They serve kids dishes as well as beer.
2/25/2021,2,"Great food, came here twice. Ordered various meals both times and sushi both times. Food comes out quick. The sushi takes FOREVER! Like everyone was done eating and I was still waiting for my sushi. Like 30 minutes after everyone else was already finished. And that was only because we had to go back up and remind them.  Then they served my roll with no wasabi or soy. I'm sure if I asked at the counter I would have gotten it. At that point I just ate it so we could leave. It was delicious and the waitress was apologetic it came out so late. But still, when you're hangry you're hangry ya know?"
10/1/2020,2,"Spent an extra 10 minutes hungry waiting next to the pick up table. It clearly says to pick up at the table, but apparently they were too ""busy"" or couldn't deign to bring it to the table. So I stood there awkwardly wondering where my food was until I finally got annoyed and went to the counter. My food was just sitting there. I wouldn't mind walking all the way to the counter but some signage would be nice instead of looking dumb waiting for food that never comes to where it's supposed to be. And in all honesty I don't see why it's difficult to put the food where it belongs so customers can grab it."
1/9/2018,3,"Second time in row I've come in for a Boba Tea and there was no boba. Food is good, but wondering if they need some inventory mechanisms in place to not run out of a vital ingredient especially on a day when they are Buy One Get One. My review could have easily been a strong 4 stars."
8/20/2021,1,"I went in and ordered a bowl of Udon with sesame stir fry and chicken. I also ordered a cup of tao tea with lychee flavoring and boba. I've had this boba combo before at another shop and it came out smooth and just a little sweet. That boba was great but the boba here however was nothing like this. This boba was harsh, waaaay too sweet and left a rubbery taste in my mouth. After drinking this my mouth was somehow more dry than before, so I decided that it would be necessary to have  some water. I asked the server for some water and this convo ensued, (server) ""I'm sorry but our water fountain is broken so that wouldn't be possible"", (me reluctantly) ""Umm ok, so could I just get some tap water instead"", (server) ""I am truly sorry but we just can't do that, (me frustrated) ""okkkeyyy then"". After that I walked back to my table in disappointment and a dry mouth.           At this point I wanted to just leave but u had paid $30 for this meal so I was not going to waist it. Five minutes later my food arrived and actually looked pretty good but by this point I realized that they had given me lo menu instead of the Udon that I had ordered. I got over this and just started eating. It was pretty good. The chicken was cooked well and the stir fry was as well. The sauce was good and complimented the noodles. I left with a full belly but also dry rubbery mouth and a thought of passively bad service. Overall: 10Food: 6/10Service: 3/10Drink: 1/10Cost effectiveness: 3.5/10"
9/24/2017,5,"First time here and I'm in love. I have always avoided this restaurant because it seemed so crowded but when I visited for a Friday date night we got through the line in about 10 minutes and once we ordered we received our food in less than 5 minutes. The service was very fast and all of the employees were nice and helpful. I ordered a custom poké bowl (for $12) with shrimp, spicy tuna, salmon, mango, avocado, shitake mushrooms, tempura flakes and white rice. It. Was. Delicious. I love the ginger sauce with it because it is flavorful and a little bitter which helps to balance out the dish. I was surprised by how small the serving was initially but by the end of my meal I realized it was the perfect amount. My husband and I shared a Dynamite II roll and a Salmon roll that were both the best sushi we have had since moving to Jacksonville. I don't normally like fried sushi but the Dynamite II roll was undeniably good and huge (10 pieces).My husband ordered a shrimp lo mein bowl that was really flavorful. It wasn't greasy at all and the flavors were bright, instead of the dish being drowned in soy sauce. Overall, I loved this place and will definitely be back!"
7/30/2018,5,Perfect as always.  Been here dozens of times- love everything I've had (fall back is the build ur own poke bowl.)  Their sushi salmon is amazing!  Everything is always so fresh & we always get our food quickly.  They have an app for takeout too which rocks!  Place u dont mind eating at alone or with a bunch of friends.
6/4/2020,4,Yummy bento box Asian food. A lot of food for the price you pay! We had left overs. Only taking a star off because our salads were kinda blah. The leaves weren't super fresh. Everything else was super good! We will be back!
6/6/2020,1,Service was awful. My friend didn't even get her food thirty min after we already did so she canceled it. The general chicken was so horrible my other friend could eat it. MY food was a sushi bowl that was actually disgusting. WARM RAW salmon. I literally feel sick and found a random mushroom in my bowl? We were treated awful by customer service as well.
4/15/2020,3,"Ordered lunch a couple of days ago through DoorDash. Got the Bamboo and the Special Mex and it was $25.23 without service fee, delivery tip, etc. We thought the rolls were extremely overpriced considering the dozens of sushi options we have within a 3 mile radius of our apartment. To top it off, we didn't get chopsticks as we requested so we ended up spending over $30 on only two rolls of sushi that we ate with a fork lol."
5/1/2019,5,"There are over 50 restaurants at the St. John's Town Center, and I'd easily put Bento in my top three.  I've had a lot of things on their pan-Asian menu, and most of it really good.  But once I discovered the Spicy Cream Chicken, I never looked back.Sure they've got some solid sushi as well, but throw some of their tender noodles in a bowl, add a heap of that Spicy Cream Chicken (with a swirl of sriracha sauce like a spicy cherry on top), and it doesn't get much better.  The restaurant itself is a little cramped, that would be my only knock.  It's counter service too, so once you've ordered, you better hope you can find an open table to enjoy you plate of creamy deliciousness.  But unless you're there at peak lunch hours, you should be fine.The service has always been really friendly, and the food comes out pretty quick too.  I love the atmosphere and the colors as well.  Overall, when I'm looking for a quick and tasty place for lunch, it's hard to compete with Bento Cafe...although I think they dropped the ""Cafe"" part of their name for some reason."
3/7/2019,3,"Clean lines and contemporary is the vibe. I had looked at the menu before stopping by and thought I had what I wanted picked out until I was informed the don't make that sushi roll there- well, crap. So I switched to another roll. I was sent juggling the cup, table marker and my purse and headed to the free style coke drink machine. The woman in front of me had the same problem juggling everything and left her table marker behind- and guess what I did? The same exact thing- left it at the drink station and had to go back for it! The cashier was polite and sweet. Within 10 minutes I was delivered my 8 piece Mexican roll. I love sushi- but I should have went with the fried rice after I couldn't get the one roll I wanted. This roll was little shrimp and tons of cream cheese. I will have to give them another try- maybe order something hot- another entree. I will be sure to update my review when I do! They were ok- but I wanted great!"
1/13/2018,4,Quick and easy date night! Food was delicious and hot but camePut one by one so my fiancé's food cameOur way before mine. We had to ask someone if mine had gottenMissed. Quick to fix and very apologeticAnd the delicious flavors made up forIt.
9/3/2019,3,"Forrest Gump could solve a trigonometry problem faster than getting my order taken for Korean chicken at this location. I once watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the time it takes to stand in line here. Whenever I want to grow out a beard I just come to Bento for lunch and it looks good by the time I leave. Ladies don't buy hair extensions: just come here, wait in line for your order and your hair will be grown out by the time you pay. Roseanne era John Goodman could run a 40 yard dash faster than the time it takes to get an udon rice bowl order in. So yes the food is splendid for a chain restaurant but expect to wait longer than the time it takes to read Leviticus backwards."
7/27/2019,4,The orange tofu was one of the best I've had. The bento boxes are a really fun experience. The vegetable sushi was not the best but everything else was excellent. Great boba as well.
9/21/2018,1,"To begin with I just wanna say how much I used to love this place! Tonight I asked my husband to order me ""build a poke ball"" The usual price was $12 plus tax and tonight while picking up my order I can't believe they change the prices to $15 plus tax. Is this a joke? Their sushi are good but pricey, sushi house down the street has amazing sushi for a better price. I have order to go so many time from this place and some how they always screw me and my household order with some small portion that that can fill only a child up. I'm sorry after the disappointment with this place has made me not want to ever order anything from this place."
3/13/2018,1,"This location sold me FROZEN CHICKEN WINGS!!!There was no SHAME! The girl took it back and brought another batch and guess what? They were still FROZEN! Sorry not worth my time, there are too many competitors to stomach nasty dining experiences. The sushi was ok but I could never trust a kitchen that would send out frozen food. The manager never came out and apologized because no one cared. Disgusting behavior for a restaurant. If your looking for a sushi fix try somewhere else cause there is nothing worst than food poisoning, I don't trust anyone who does not care about the quality of their food."
6/13/2017,4,"Bento is a great concept that brings different styles of Asian cuisine together in one restaurant. Bento blue is located in the town center and is connected to the frozen yogurt place, mochi, next door. They offer different styles of Asian food like sushi, stir fry, fried rice, and various soups and apps. Also they serve boba drinks which are hot or miss for me in the flavor department. Some of the better dishes are the spicy cream fried chicken and the Korean stir fry entrees. This meals can be paired with rice, noodles, or put into a bento box for an assortment of sides. Even though the price is very reasonable for the portion size, I somehow always still hungry unless I order an app or sushi to go with my meal.The noodle dishes standout for me and are all delicious, but I love me some noodles so take that as it is. Once I found my go to dishes I always have a great meal. Some of the boba flavors are not that good but I just go with Thai tea when all else fails. If you are new to Asian fare, go to bento as they have the beginners guide to what to eat with different flavors from different Asian cultures. They should introduce a two entree combo so I can try more dishes on my visits."
5/8/2019,4,"I already have a favorite sushi restaurant, so this would definitely be my second go-to sushi place. Very fun hype young crowd (super loud) inside that is usually why we order and eat outside because it is very noisy- A lot of kids and UNF students. Over all the sushi is delicious and always fresh."
5/30/2019,4,Pretty darn good for lunch under $10. I had the mini Build Your Own Poke bowl. I had poke soy salmon with rice and toppings. Very good but prepare to wait- it gets really busy at lunch time!
2/4/2019,5,Nice and casual plus hours open most all day long so it fits our crazy schedule.  Not noisy either.The food was awesome and the prices were good.  Therefore: 5 stars !Will def go there often.
6/2/2015,4,"I like Bento, but what is not to like? They have Sushi. They have Thai. They have Chinese. They have Japanese. Okay, you get the idea that it is an Asian restaurant. So come ready to order, when you hit the door.It is a bit hurried, the dining room a bit crowded and loud but the food chooses are so good even the pickiest eater in your group will be pleased. My favorites include Mongolian Beef and Sushi, but so far everything's good."
5/18/2019,2,"As someone who loves Bentos and has tried many different locations across that state, this is so far the worst one. I am writing this review in hope that this will open someone's eyes to the issues they have in house and improve. First there was only one cashier when there was a long line. The reason it got so long was because two different parties wanted the cashier to explain the entire menu to their needs. I get that. I got pissed because all the other employees saw the line and made themselves look busy to avoid dealing with the line. By the time someone took the reigns and opened another cashier, he was overly too nice to the point of being super fake. I get good customer service but that was too much. Next issue is that they run out of sauces to meals. This is a common issue in some bentos especially when they first open. I dont know how long this location has been open, but Please make sure you are well stocked. Next, tables were dirty when trying to sit down. Not really noticable if you just pass the table but it is noticable when you try to put your napkins down and the table is sticky. Last, my fiance and I both had bentos fried rice, one of our favorite dishes and instantly noticed something wrong. The rice was cooked in too much water making it mushy beyond belief as well as the veggies. This needs to be watched. We couldn't eat our meals but hopefully this will help knowing for future reference."
12/29/2018,5,"Finally! I've been hearing about this place for ages and finally got the chance to try it. So. Good. I got the red curry with chicken and udon noodles and it was perfect. It had the perfect amount of spice and had just enough food for the price. For it being so busy on a Saturday, the service was quick and the food came out hot. I can't wait to try other things on the menu!"
9/8/2016,4,"My thoughts on a first visit to this establishment:- Bento boxes are neat; you can get so much stuff that it may not matter how things taste (quantity over quality, right???)- Lots of drink options--so many kinds of liquid refreshment. I went with the Taro Thai Tea and it was OK.- our sushi rolls didn't come with wasabi; we had to ask for it and more ginger- sushi rolls we ordered looked really cool but tasted just OK.The Spicy Cream Chicken is really good and as long as you don't think about the calories of this fried, saucy, creamy creation, it's great. I wish the noodles tasted fresher/better in the bento because I had to eat rice instead to make a more satisfying bite. This rating/visit was elevated by the SCC, no doubt!"
11/5/2019,3,"I get lunch here regularly, and always eat in the restaurant.  I usually order sushi rolls (raw fish) and quality is decent, service pretty quick.  I do tip the sushi chefs in cash when they do a great job - which is my usual experience, but today the quality was a little below par for this place.  The rainbow roll was falling apart on one end, not cut in evenly sized pieces, and in a couple of places not even cut all the way through.  I didn't recognize the usual crew behind the counter, so maybe there has been some turnover.  One other nit - the restaurant uses a retail system that makes you go through a process to leave a tip when you are checking out.  I see other restaurants doing the same - - - -how are you supposed to leave a tip when you haven't had any service yet?  Stupid.  But it makes you go through the process and enter zero if you aren't tipping up front."
4/3/2021,1,"I would give zero stars if I could. Went to dinner with a friend, they ordered after me and received there food 10 minutes after ordering. I however waited 20 minutes with no food. Horrible experience!"
8/21/2016,4,"Bento is a lunch staple for me. You can get an array of food... Udon noodle bowl, Korean beef, Thai curry, Japanese curry, sushi, stir fry, bento boxes! And with all of those options it's fast, consistent, and always delicious!My go to is the yellow curry chicken bow with rice or noodles, or the red chicken curry katsu. Both delicious! My friend will get the red and yellow curry and Mix it together! Ha! The options are endless! Sometimes the line can be long, and it's annoying that they charge you for extra sauce or vegetables..."
3/24/2016,4,"Bento Café is a small, but very popular sushi and Pan-Asian fusion restaurant around the perimeter of St. Johns Town Center. I liked the fact that they were open until after 10 on a weekend evening, so I was able to pop in and enjoy some tasty rolls after the sun went down.This little café had quite a line of hungry diners who shuffled inside, picked up a menu, placed their order at the counter, and then sat down while waiting for their food to be delivered. Everything on Bento's menu is cooked to order and prepared in minutes. The restaurant has a very sleek and modern look with lots of brushed aluminum and blue dragon colors.The menu is a fun mixture of traditional nigiri sushi, sashimi, hand rolls, classic sushi rolls, sashimi bowls, and sushi sampler platters. If you prefer your little fishies to be cooked before they reach your table, then you can order different types of teriyaki, stir fry, noodle bowls, curries, and noodle soups. One very popular option is the bento box which is your choice of a smaller-sized entrée with steamed white or brown rice, lo mein, ginger salad, string beans, and orange slices for just under $10.I sat at a table near the sushi bar, and waited for them to bring out my miso soup and two different rolls. The first was a Volcano Special roll, made with tempura shrimp, tuna, wakame, cream cheese topped with avocado, baked tilapia, krab, kreemchee sauce, eel sauce, and tempura flakes. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese with my sushi, but this roll was surprisingly good.My second roll was the TNT Roll which was a special spicy tuna mixed with masago and scallions, then layered with seared tuna, spicy mayo, and sprinkled Japanese chili peppers. Spicy and very yummy!I would describe Bento Café as an Asian fast-food place, where the food is very fresh and good, and where you'll be in and out within a short time frame. This place is worth a stop if you're in the area."
8/12/2018,3,"Stopped here to grab a quick bite of sushi with the family. We used to frequent Bento years ago and loved their spicy tuna/salmon bowl. I went for the old standby and was a tad disappointed. While the presentation is still very nice, the fish want as fresh as I had remembered. In addition, they have changed the formulation of their spicy mayo and the flavor seemed too sweet (perhaps a switch to a mayo similar in flavor to miracle whip vs hellmans as an example). My son got the spicy Szechwan chicken with lo mein noodles. It was average (not all breast meat chicken and far too much of the salty sauce. I found this trip average and more of a fast food variety of Asian/sushi."
3/8/2014,4,"I was craving me some cuisine of the ""asian persuasion"" and through some fellow yeeps, I've heard really good things about Bento Cafe, so I figured this would be an ideal lunch spot. From bento boxes, to ramen, to fresh sushi and boba teas, the choices are quite extensive, so if you're a first timer like I was, do yourself a favor and look up the menu online before you go, because while there may be a line when you get there, it moves quicker than you'd think, and nobody wants to be ""that person trying to decide"" at the register. Fried Pork Dumplings: Served piping hot with a sweet soy dipping sauce. The dumpling was perfectly crispy and stuffed with ample amounts of savory pork filling. I could have ate just these and left happy.Pork Katsu Bento Box: Fried in panko bread crumbs and served with tonkatsu sauce. Comes with white rice, ginger salad, noodles, and string beans. The noodles were rather bland, in my opinion and needed a kick...or a kickstart. The pork was justtttttttttt a smidgen on the salty side, but delish nonetheless, and even better when dipped in the sauce. I do wish I had more than one scoop of rice, though. While hesitant to try the ginger salad because more often than not, the dressing is too heavy on the ginger, I found Bento Box's version quite refreshing and tasty. Almond Joy Milk Tea Smoothie with Pearls: A fan? Ehhhhhh not so much. I think they forgot to throw the Joy part in. Alot of almond flavor, but not a hint of coconut. The pearls were abundant, but the flavor overall was not just lacking...but rather slacking.Recommend? YES. The menu online lists the prices and flavor profiles of each dish (including whether spicy or not), and you get a good sized meal for your money.  Next on the list will definitely be the ramen soup, as many patrons seemed to be enjoying this quite fondly. Till next time, See You On Yelp!"
4/17/2018,2,"We used to love Bento - when we lived in that area of Jax it was a biweekly if not weekly place to eat. After we moved, we'd even make the trip from Fleming Island for their sushi! But I've written them off. They've changed their menu far too much including a now limited sushi menu (getting rid of 2 of the 4 rolls we eat) and their food just isn't worth the price. For the first time in 8 years of eating there, I walked out without ordering. The restaurant itself looked unkept, was stifling hot, and had an unappetizing smell. We were planning on eating inside as it was 80 degrees out yet it was hotter inside than outside. And obviously, I was perturbed that half our favorites had been removed from the menu."
3/1/2016,3,"Let me first say that when it comes to asian food, I'm kinda picky. This place is asian fast food so I came in with an open mind. I can only speak for the 2 dishes we had. Beef Bulgogi Rice Bowl $7.95 - While the flavor was good, it's not what bulgogi should taste. It was oily and made the rice very oily. If it wasn't so oily it would have been a good dish.Cantonese Pork Chop Rice Bowl $7.50 - This was very good. It actually reminded me of my family and how I miss home cooked food. We came about 40 mins after they opened on a Sunday and I also wanted to get the boba tea but they were still cooking it. That sucks. I'm sorry but they should already have that made before they open. All in all, not really sure if I'll come back because there are so many other places in Jax that I can try. In other words..."
10/1/2019,2,Great in the beginning. But quality has gone down in the past year and prices up they charge for extra sauces like it guacamole. Would come here more often if the WiFi was better to study. It just seems that the more corporate they become the lower quality they become
1/1/2018,4,"Bento Cafe was the BOMB back in my high school and college days. It was and still now a good place for groups of friends. The service was really quick and the food was delicious. Although it was very busy during lunch hours, this place was definitely great for quick bite. The prices were reasonable and decent. Now that many months and years have passed, I don't find this place exciting. My craving for this place has been decreased. The food has becoming more plain and not authentic. It's not as good as usual. The quality of the food has steadily declined.Overall, this place is okay. The staff are nice and helpful. The environment is friendly. But the food isn't like ""you must try this"" feeling. The food quality isn't that great anymore."
6/24/2016,3,"This is our second time here. My husband got the bento box and I got the Szechuan  shrimp. At first everything looked great but when I tried it, all I tasted was a bunch of pepper seeds. It lacked flavor and worse of all I had to get a new one because the first bowl I had, had Hair in it!!!! But I'll do give them some points since they offer military discount and the service was fast. But idk if well come back there anytime soon.. Maybe if we're around the area. I should've just stuck to my gut and got some thing else. Oh well next time."
3/25/2018,5,All new menus n presentation today /a restaurant where u order what u want as well as set ingredients Ordered the following:The build-poke-bowl 3 protein-mixed green finally is a nice Romain mixture- protein portions r very generous n fresh- addition now include kimchi- toppings now include fried garlic & fried onions it like having a korean  sashimi bimbbop minus the eggThe bento box chicken katsu was very flavorful n served right out of the fryerThe rolls were huge n inexpensive Sat at the sushi bar - service the best - crew kept checking on me n suggested more items as they prepared other customer 's orderFinally a great place for all families/couples /n friends to get Asian /Japanese cuisine at a affordable price tagAnd for Desert- boba fresh brewed teas in exotic flavors
6/10/2019,4,"Let me begin this review off with saying Bento is one of me and my boyfriends favorite restaurants. We go AT LEAST once a month, but normally twice. We normally eat in and I enjoy any of their sushi rolls, typically the Mex Roll or the Florida Roll. My boyfriend loves their Pad Thai as well. My last experience was definitely a very frustrating one. I called an order in at 5:45pm on a Friday, expecting them to say the food would be ready in 30 minutes, they said 10-15. So I rushed there, arrived by 6:00pm, and was surprised at how slow it was for a Friday night. I paid for my food and was told all they had to do was bag it up and I would be good to go. So I was given a number and sat at a nearby table. Unfortunately I was sitting at that table starving for over 15 minutes. No employee checked on me despite my many attempts at making eye contact with the gentlemen who cashed me out. Finally, I went back to the register and asked the three employees that were standing around where my food was. The gentleman who cashed me out proceeded to check all the bags and mine just happened to be the bag that had been sitting there for at least 10 minutes, if not since the time I arrived in the restaurant. I love Bento, and I hate writing any negative reviews, but this was an extremely disappointing experience to say the least. Especially because by the time I got home, the food was completely cold."
9/1/2019,4,"It was really busy when we came here (it was a Saturday night so to be expected), but the line went surprisingly fast. All the staff is really friendly and I feel like you get a lot of food for the price. When my bowl was taking a while to come out, they even offered me another miso soup to make up for the wait time. However, typically the food comes out very quickly."
2/15/2020,4,"Cool place, but they start closing everything thing an hour and a half early. I tried to call to place an order for pick-up but they said they don't do phone orders after a certain time....it was an hour and a half before closing ? So I had to go there a place a to-go order instead and they closed down their Boba Tea option AN HOUR BEFORE THEY CLOSE.....  I get that they wanted to go home and they were tired but come on. It would makes sense if I came in 30 Minutes before closing time but I didn't.  It's a shame because they look like such a good place and the food was good to but their operation really isn't that good. I get it's probably the manager making the calls and not the employees, so that's just poor management. Also, it was a Saturday night, you should expect late orders on a Saturday. Again, cool place, but I will probably never go again. Shame.AND there was a family still inside eating their food while the employees were putting the chair on the tables and cleaning up. That's extremely rude. It was 40 minutes till closing when that happened."
2/15/2020,5,GReat experience and RJ was such a pleasure to worK with as he took our complicated order. Everyone is friendly and  professional! Definitely a wonderful experience. We had a party of 11 and everything was delicious.
8/12/2019,1,"I have been coming here for over 10 years. !The floor manager today was so rude over my six-year-old filling her drink up with Sprite instead of water and made a huge thing charged us & brought over the receipt took my card and made us pay for that sprite by God! And her attitude the whole time. Unbelie Food has gone down hill over the years and that wonderful manager insured we will NEVER be back. They lost a 10+ year customer forever. ! Worst restaurant Mgmt I've ever seen. Will be our of business soon. Update: not a word, not a comment from jade below. Nice. We will never be back ! 12 yr customer actually. Lost due to no response which shows they responded. All they want is your money and could care less about customer service!...sad  Gave them enough time"
3/13/2018,3,"I wouldn't say I have much experience with sushi, but I know that I've tried other sushi locations and would place them above Bento. They have an ideal corner location, and you can sit outside if you desire. You go inside, order first, and then sit and eat. You won't necessarily be served unless it's the waiter bringing you your food. I usually order the box because it's both satisfying and offers a lot of sushi options that's you can pick from- however, they're what you might call ""basic"".If you don't order the box, then there's a large selection of rolls to choose from, and they're all good. My friends recommend that"
1/11/2018,5,Love Bentos I have never been disappointed in my visits to Bentos. I have found a go to in the Vegetable Stir Fry Bowl with Brown Rice and Chicken but I have liked the sushi and a couple of the other entrees! Love it...
1/27/2020,2,"Had a very disappointing experience here yesterday. My husband and I went in to have pineapple fried rice and stood in line quite a while. Once our food came his was missing both the sauce and the pineapple. Mine was missing the pineapple. After flagging down one of the staff she came back in about 10 minutes with a large portion of sauce for him but no pineapple. When I mentioned that we were both lacking pineapple she said ""oh I'm sorry ma'am"" and just walked off. Brought ours home, opened a can of dole pineapple slices and made my own pineapple fried rice. Poor customer service!"
11/19/2019,5,"I love this restaurant, I go often, the noodle bowls and the sushi always have me coming back. The spicy cream chicken is amazing, and their sushi always tastes fresh."
10/14/2017,4,If you need to curb your sushi fix quickly I highly recommend Bento in St. Johns town center. I have never had a bad experience here. Quality sushi at a great price and your food is out in minutes. If you are not in the mood for sushi the hibachi steak bowl with brown rice and the pad thai bowl with noodles are my favs.
8/12/2018,5,This place is extremely good. For fast sushi it is great!!They are also extremely fast getting your order out. The staff is very friendly as well!!
1/19/2016,4,My husband and I love coming here! The food is fairly priced and it has a cool vibe going on inside. If you're shopping around the town center or are just craving asian cuisine this is the place to hit up! They have so many options to choose from. Every time I go I get the salmon tuna don. It's so much food for $8.25 and so worth it you won't be disappointed. A cool feature(well I think it's cool) if you're like me and must have lemon in your water they already have one made and it's perfectly done and refreshing! I'm pretty sure they also have a cucumber water to choose. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!
3/8/2018,3,"The quality of the sushi here was good, though they should have a 6 piece per roll option instead of 4 or 8. Their sauce options lack, we really wished they had something not spicy and a traditional shrimp sauce like you'd get at other bento and sushi places. The miso and clear soups were good as well. They have salad options if you don't want soups.Be prepared to spend more than other places because of the location. For the 4, 8 piece rolls and ""combos"" to get a soup and drink you could go to another sushi place and spend less. This was definitely giving into a pregnancy craving for me to get sushi since we were already shopping at the town center."
1/16/2016,4,"I came here before and really liked this place, but this time I ordered the Mongolian noodle. I get it and there is barely any sauce. I ask the waitress if they could kindly put more sauce on it because it was rather dry. She says that there was sauce in the vegetables. Then says I can buy more sauce for 50 cents. I say sure, but pointed out it was dry in the first place. So they bring me a receipt for $1.07. Now it is a dollar plus tax. I get the sauce and it is quite a lot. All I wanted was for the cook to add a bit more. The food is good, but this incident really turned me off and I will skip this place in the future. I hope they enjoy the dollar for the 10 cents worth of sauce and making a customer unhappy.Update:  I had to upgrade my 2 to a 4 because Bento Director contacted me and apologized.  I was offered a $10 compliment next time I am there and was sure to promise and talk to staff so this would not happen again.  I feel I should upgrade the rating because they actually care and that means a lot.  So despite my experience I still like this place and feel they create good food."
1/22/2018,1,"I was really disappointed.  I got the veggie stir fry with tofu and lo-mein noodles. The sauce was very bland and the dish itself was greasy. Not to mention there really weren't many snow peas (maybe 5-6) or carrots. There were a lot of mushrooms, which were delicious.  I took half home and reheated it with terryiki sauce, which improved it some.  Still not enough veggies and the tofu didn't really take on the flavor of the sauce like it should.  We asked about dessert and all they have is crunchy noodles with sweet and condensed milk.  So we asked for fortune cookies as dessert....we each got one.  The fortunes were really stupid too.  How cheap when we wanted more than just one. I won't be back."
1/5/2021,4,They've change the tofu and it's much better and crispy now! I'd definitely recommend it if you're vegetarian!
4/7/2015,3,"I've been in Bento several times to grab a quick bite while shopping it up at St. Johns Town Center. I've tried the bento box, their sushi and most recently their Pad Thai. For a fast casual style place they're doing it right. On my most recent visit I had the Pad Thai and shared an order of the fried dumplings with my dining date. The dumplings were A-OK. I don't know if I'd order them again, but I wouldn't pass them up if I was in a dumpling kind of mood. The pad thai hit the spot. Just the right amount of spice, a hint of sweetness and plenty of tofu to go around. It had a nice crispness on the outside which definitely upped the texture/mouth feel of the dish. Bento Cafe is not a place I go running to on a regular basis, but when we're in the area it's a nice option to keep on the rotation."
3/2/2018,5,Bento has been a usual hangout place for me and my friends since the theater is just around the corner. What I love about this place is that they have happy hour 5 through 630 pm . The food is awesome and they have live acoustic performances.
10/28/2019,2,"Sorry to give a less than good review but this time it is warranted .  Order the Bento box with Mongolian chicken.  Chicken was barely warm and had three green beans drenched in grease.  Ladies room was dirty, greasy floor and door paint peeling off.  No thanks not for me I'll never waste my money again ."
5/5/2018,5,"Yummy sushi. Good prices. Prompt service. Fun ambiance. ...and a kid's menu, a plus. I don't understand why people underrate this place. Perhaps they don't like having to order at a counter and prepay, but it's just an alternative method of streamlining their clients. The line takes time to get through during peak dinner hours like we experienced, but honestly it didn't take longer than a long line for in-n-out burger."
11/16/2019,5,"This could be one of the best places for sushi in Jacksonville, Miguel was the one who took our order and he was one of the kindest and most welcoming employees we could have asked for. The food was excellent and come out fast even though there was a line almost out the door. Overall a 5/5 experience and I will definitely be back again."
7/15/2018,4,"I was actually pretty impressed with this place. I ordered a noodle bowl and sushi roll, be careful the noodle bowl is HUGE but it was really good. I was less impressed with the sushi. It tasted really good but was rolled really loose and fell apart really easy. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
7/7/2011,4,"This is the closest I can get to ramen anywhere in Jacksonville. Another plus, they are open hella late. I was sick one day and wanted real soup, damn it!  So I came here. Their Sliced Beef Szechuan Soup is one of my faves on the menu. The broth is nice and hot and the beef is marinated in the sauce. I came one day after church on a Sunday and it was packed, with the line extending outside. If you are working and can't get out of the office, or you are just kicking it to The Lazy Song, you can get Bento delivered to you through the DoorStep Delivery service."
2/10/2016,3,"Lively modern setting where you order at the counter then take a seat for food to be delivered.  Cashier and servers all friendly and efficient.Food is served fast, nicely presented and  reasonably priced at this food chain strip mall sushi / bento spot.I had the spider roll.    A ten piece sushi roll with crispy soft shell crab, avocado, cucumbers, and krab* with eel sauce and masago.The sushi was well presented but the soft shell crab tasted a bit like the oil it was fried in.The Jasmine tea was hot and fragrant."
10/30/2019,3,"General Tso chick was alright. The restaurant felt dirty, but reasonably priced. Usually good sushi."
8/5/2019,2,"Typical American Japanese-ish style restaurant. As a Japanese, this is not authentic Japanese dishes. Food is not great. At least not our favorite. Poke sauce is typical Chinese soy sauce. Service is good."
11/9/2018,4,"Bento Cafe offers excellent service, food quantity, quality, and affordability. Stopped in for lunch recently and was reminded how good Bento can be. Quick order at the counter than take a number to your table to have your meal delivered to you. So many great choices and every dish can be customized based on each diners preferences. Nice fresh sushi options and plenty of hearty entrees. Pick your base such as rice or noodles, your toppings, your proteins and your sauces. If you like a nice variety, like I do, go with the Bento box. This lunch includes a ginger salad, small green bean appetizer, noodles, brown or white rice, and a main dish. I had the Pao Pao spicy cream chicken and wow, this absolutely packed a flavor rich pow! Fried breaded chunks of chicken breast dripping with this delectable flavorful sauce. I have no idea what is in it, and certain is it not on any healthy eating diet plan, but it is so delicious. Just enough spice to pack amazing flavor but not too much for the spicy heat timid like me. I upgraded my lunch to a combo with a drink and extra side, the soup, and I had way more food in front of me than I could polish off in one sitting even on my hungriest days. Overall, Bento is one of my top choices on my lunch rotation list again."
10/12/2020,1,"Bento used to be my favorite place to eat... I am so disappointed with their customer service lately. I had a 30 minute lunch break, so I wanted to call in my order ahead of time so I had plenty of time to take a break and eat. I called over 7 times, phone was disconnected or simply just were not answering. I drove to the Tinseltown location to place my order. I was in such a hurry to get there I left my debit card at work. Apparently they don't take cash because of COVID....even though the cashier was wearing gloves and a mask..... I missed my entire lunch break. This is not the first time bento has dropped the ball... When I have got food to-go in the past, something is always missing. I will not be eating here ever again. Thank goodness there is several other options in that area and people who have a busy work schedule will not miss their lunch breaks."
8/30/2020,2,Wtf is wrong with their boba drinks. The drinks are way too sweet and powdery and the boba pearls are way too hard and chewy. Get your shit together Bento
11/9/2016,4,"The first time I went to Bento Cafe was when I was a college student in Gainesville in the, let's just say 2000s. Wide-eyed, bushy-tailed at the Asian fusion concept and bento boxes, I really enjoyed the restaurant, even though it was always crowded in an already confined space. Flash forward to present-day and it appears this business is thriving in Jacksonville. Their food menu have expanded significantly as well, although they still provide bento box dinners among other Asian foods. This is a sit-down fast-food Asian fusion dining that offers primarily Japanese, Korean, and Chinese foods. This location is not to be confused with the Bento Southside location, which offers waiter service. The Southside location is, I guess you can say, a more refined version. For what it is, the food is decent and the price point/range is reasonable. It's a nice addition to the fast foods dining option at the Town Center."
12/6/2016,4,"Asian cuisine is by far my favorite of all fares. I'm usually pretty picky about things only because there is this preference for cream sauces and smothering everything in cheese, and I'm just not a fan. Which is why I love Asian fare so much; there are so many other options that all taste amazing. That being said, when I want some sushi, sashimi, or a Bento Box, Bento is usually where I go. I've only had one instance where they let me down but that was years ago and the mistake has not since been repeated. I used to get only their sushi Bento Box meal (I've had the regular Bento Box, equally delicious but sushi is my weakness!) but after discovering the goodness that was their Spicy Tuna-Salmon Don bowl, my allegiance was converted. Now each time I go guess what I get? If you guessed the bowl, you get a cookie (idk from where but treat yourself). Though I get the beets and scallions removed my favorite thing about the bowl is how fresh it is. The great thing about sushi and such is that for me, I can eat a bunch and not feel horrible afterwards. The chunks of tuna and salmon, spicy mayo, steamed rice, seaweed salad, slices of cucumber, and masago simply equates to my palatable joy. There really isn't much of anything I have against Bento's menu or the experience their. Except for the fact that I've found a new place to get my sushi bowl but Bento still has a good one. Keep up the good work."
8/29/2018,1,"Extremely disappointed. I have been coming to Bento for more than 5 years. I have always loved it but everyone who has been coming for that long knows the standards and the quality of the restaurant have only went down. I had a sushi combo box and asked for the Rainbow. I got served a fish that was not fresh at all. After I finished i left the sushi that just didn't look right and passed on my opinion to one of the males employees. I said that white tuna shouldn't look brown on the edges and he said they didn't sell white tuna, but rather escolar. I did not mind this but no where in the menu it said escolar. Regardless it shouldn't look that bad. At least tell the chefs to cut the edges that don't look good so that a person would actually want to eat it. Very bad presentation."
5/8/2021,1,"they ""couldnt"" help me make the order the way i wanted it so i dont even know if i will like it , food took very long , friends order came before mine , an then order was wrong !! first time coming and will not come back ."
6/7/2018,5,"Love this place! Food is great and the amount you get for the price is amazing! Always a great experience, it's helped me like sushi, never been a fan before going here. So good."
8/9/2017,5,"I love Bento, I really enjoy the flexibility of being able to customize my rolls with healthier options like brown rice or lettuce rolls. I like building my own rolls. I like being able to substitute soy or rice wrappers on any roll. The online ordering makes everything super easy and fast. They have a great variety of rolls to choose from, the fruit rolls are some of my favorites because I like to pretend I'm being healthy. I also like that they have a wide variety of menu options...my boyfriend doesn't eat sushi and so I rarely get to have it, but we can both come to bento and find things we like."
2/24/2019,1,Horribly slow service! Not even busy called ahead and still had to wait forever for them to finish completing my order. Thankfully one lady worker noticed my order was not being fulfill yet as i stood there and took initiative! But i should have never have had to wait that long when i called way in advance  Did i mentioned the place was not even busy at the time...
6/29/2014,3,"Bento's food isn't bad, it's actually pretty decent for a cheaper version of sushi/pan Asian cuisine.  The only problem is that they charge pretty much the same amount of $$ as a good sushi place for sushi that most would say is a few steps above grocery store sushi!!  You'll find that this is case with the rest of the menu as well, although everything might taste ok it isn't worth the price per item, and unfortunately everything is priced individually besides the bento boxes which come with there basic side items.I do like the fact that they have the coca-cola freestyle machines here, and if you want some fro-yo after your meal Mochi is right next door at this location.  You no longer have to walk out of Bento and walk the 25 or so feet to walk into Mochi's door anymore as they now have a hall way that connects the two together."
8/18/2019,1,"Terrible experience and food. When we arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday night, they we already out of  any entree with fried chicken. They were out of green beans and broccoli which my bento box should have come with. The soda machine was out and my husband had to wait 15 minutes for his drink. When I got my boba, the boba was hard. All the food was super bland including my side of Ramen which took 30 minutes to get to me. By that time I was already done with the rest of my meal. Don't eat here!"
12/15/2016,3,"I love Bento however it can be a hit or miss and the food consistency. The food is always fresh. The lines can be long but it moves very quickly. It can get busy and loud in the dining room. Average sushi, the bento boxes are good, the Tuna Don (sushi bowl)is awesome!"
7/9/2016,3,"A friend from New York came down for my wedding and as we were in town center shopping, we decided since the husbands don't like sushi we would come together to Bento to get our sushi fix. We ordered at the register after perusing the menu and decided on the lunch special. We picked a few rolls and sat down. A waitress brought us our plates which were neatly prepared after a few minutes. Honestly, the sushi was delicious but it tasted like the rolls I buy from Publix. Nothing super spectacular. It's nice to sit down somewhere very contemporary and modern to eat your sushi and sip Boba tea with friends, but again nothing extraordinary. Overall, I enjoy Bento and it's great for a quick bite of sushi to get a fix. The lunch special is a great deal and freshly made and the service was lovely. I would come here again when I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way if I wanted sushi."
7/27/2019,2,"Very unorganized and unsanitary for a restaurant that has been around for a few years. The bathroom to put it ""nicely"" was disgusting. I've had decent meals here 3 or 4 times but last one prior to today was very mediocre. Not going back after today."
7/1/2017,4,"This place looks really nondescript so I was surprised when someone suggested it to me. It gets crowded, like line out the door. There are no servers at this location; you order and seat yourself and someone brings out your food. The line moved pretty quickly. I got the yellow curry (coconut milk based) which is one of my favorites and something my Asian mom always cooked when I was growing up. It really tasted like her cooking! I was very impressed and look forward to trying more dishes. I guess I will try their other location in Southside because I would prefer a bar (this location only had beer)."
7/17/2014,4,"I like coming to Bento every time I'm back in Jacksonville because it's good quality asian food, not over priced and it's filing. Bento has really fast service and it's definitely a nice place to go and have lunch with a friend or a quick and affordable dinner with family. What's unique about bento is the menu and ordering style. You stand in line to order your food kinda like a fast food joint. You are given a number that you place at your table and they bring the food to you. You can tip of you like but it's not sit down service which is pretty cool because it's good eats on a budget. You can also eat outside which is also a great opinion for when the weather is beautiful. Everything on the menu exception the sushi portion of the menu can be ordered either in a plate, bowl, or bento box option. And the item you order can be made with your choice of beef, chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Each choice of beef, chicken etc is set at a price and each plating comes with different things. For example the plate comes with rice, the bowl is cooked noodle style, and bento box has a smaller serving of rice than the plate but comes with small ginger salad.  So the price of your meal really depends on your choice of meat. I got the garlic mushroom chicken bowl. I enjoy noodles very much so I always go with bowl style cooking. I've tried the garlic mushroom chicken as a plate option so it's presented with rice. But I like the noodles way better. I'm only giving bento 4 stars because the menus were sticky and the table was really sticky. So bento just needs to cleanup the location a little bit and it's a 5star location"
1/5/2017,1,"Very disappointed with the customer service! Food is great but I tried to buy my 1 year old baby rice from the kids menu and the lady in the cashier told me she couldn't because it was for ""12 and under""! (I was buying myself a bowl PLUS the kids menu) I explained  her that I wanted for him that he was under 12 and she said ""no, is for 12 and under"" like if she couldn't understand english or couldn't see my son in the table! I loved this place but after this treatment like if I was asking something for free I am not coming back again!"
4/21/2015,4,"I love to come here at least once a week. I have to try not to go for lunch sometimes because I go to much (I know it doesn't show in the check-ins but I should be the Dutchess ;)) I really love sushi just check my bio lol it is a smaller establishment but they are pretty quick on bringing out your meal. It is an order first then sit and eat set up. be aware there are two menus: one for sushi and one for bento boxes/ rice/noodle bowls. There are so many option to choose from. I sometimes just go to my favorites because it's easier than finding something new. From 3-6 during the week they have a Buy 2 great 1 free roll special. Highly reccomend. Their different rolls are delicious.If you are going to go for stir fry, I think the bento box gives you the most bang for your buck. That goes for sushi too. watchout during peek lunch times, it does get busy."
3/25/2020,3,This place can be hit or miss it used to be really really good but they either changed their recipes or the quality of the ingredients cause the only thing I get from them now is the poke bowl.the shrimp are like boiled so bland and rubbery. The tofu has an off flavor which must be from how they cook it of the seasoning they add. The sushi rolls aren't the same. The red curry which used to be my favorite is now too spicy. So I have to be in the mood to come here which is sad cause everything I tried used to be good.
5/23/2016,3,"The food is good and the service is ok. You order at the counter get a number and then they bring it to you. Sushi, stir fry, Chinese dishes. Beer and wine is available. The couple of times I've been here it's been busy. I'll be back I'm sure."
5/8/2014,3,"I absolutely love the atmosphere here. Not so much the restrooms or the crowded awkward moment of walking through the tables to get to an empty one. Staff is sort of friendly. Food I like it a lot I wish it would come out kind of warm at least, it's always room temp and a bit cooler. I like my food hot and fresh if you know what I mean. Boba, I don't like it here at all. The drinks they make itself isn't rich or flavored as it supposed to be. It's either watery or lacking the flavor of the drink. Boba balls itself I'm surprised they got that correct but each time I came here I would give them another chance to change my mind but none of the drinks are.. How they should be. Over all I don't mind coming here from time to time but I'm not really in love with the place as others are."
12/23/2017,4,It's my first time trying this place and it won't be the last! The food is amazing and fresh
12/27/2016,3,"3 stars because I enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but the boba milk tea could have been MUCH better.I got the chicken garlic soy udon noodles. This was my first time trying udon noodles and I was suprised that I really enjoyed the overall taste and thickness (compared to lo mein). I could taste the garlic, but it wasn't overwhelming. And there was no need for extra soy because the amount the noodles were cooked in was just right - didn't make me extra thirsty (sodium struggles)!However, if I'm being really honest, what I really came for was to try the boba milk tea. I was introduced to milk tea about a year ago in Gainesville, FL (UF student). I enjoy trying boba in different places and cities (especially) when I have the opportunity. I was extra excited because Bento (at least this location) has bogo milk tea on tuesdays with valid college ID. I got mango milk tea with tapioca pearls and I enjoyed the taste...at first. Then the powder settled and I kept sipping up lots of powder - it coated my throat it was so much! My only positive about the milk tea is the tapioca pearls - they weren't too hard, but nice and squishy. If the milk tea was made with milk instead of powder it would be amazing.Basically, food was delicious, milk tea not as much. The atmosphere and workers were pleasant. The line is long, but moves fast, with the tables cleared fast as well because the workers move people in and out fast. Also, if you love the Coca-Cola drinks, there's a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine so you have plenty of drink options!"
12/27/2014,3,"How do you run out of Pad Thai?   Otherwise, our meal was good.  Great variety of dishes.  This is a small restaurant.   Very tight."
8/18/2016,5,"Went around 7:15pm, it was pretty busy but not too bad. We couldn't get a menu as soon as we walked in but a worker saw that we didn't have one and helped us out immediately. I ordered the Tuna Poke Don and the Sushi Combo box and it was pretty great. Could have used more spicy mayo though for the Poke Don. (Got some extra on the side)"
5/28/2016,5,"A fun place to eat for young and old alike. You can choose from a variety of options and have a bento box option that cute. I could see it as a perfect hangout place for people who want to savor a quick Asian bite in a very contemporary yet informal atmosphere, coupled with a wide selection of boba teas... U surely can. Have them without the boba. Also not to mention the small inside store passage to the next door store - Mochi ice cream and yogurt store... Cannot leave that!"
7/7/2018,5,Ate Bentos for dinner and their Steak Lo Mein is absolutely delicious!! Will be back!!
1/8/2018,4,"This is practically my go to sushi restaurant. I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed in my life. Service is quick and great, food comes out nice and ready, and the atmosphere of this place makes a great hang out spot. I wish this place had some sort of expansion. My only complaint is that there's not enough booths or tables for everyone to dine in. I really can't deny why this place would have so much business, IT'S FANTASTIC! An expansion would just top off this place!"
5/23/2018,3,I don't recommend getting sushi there. It's quite sweet and tasted a bit artificial. Felt like it cater to the younger crowd. My husband got the steak bento box. He said it was average
7/5/2019,1,I am still waiting for my meal at 2:07 PM after paying 20 minutes ago. People have come in and eaten after me. Not impressed. My meal was $13 and I still have not gotten it. I'm pissed.
5/2/2016,5,"Love this place! In the cold months (ok, for real,  weeks...we live in Florida) my Go To is their Laksa. OMG! So fantastic! I would probably even have if it were 100 degrees out but they don't have it. And then my other Go To is their Spicy Salmon Don. Either way, don't forget their boba teas! They probably have my favorite in town, not too soft but not overly chewy either. I always get the Green Tea without flavor but they carry a good selection of options and other milk teas. This is a must if you like Asian food or if you're looking to try!"
5/6/2016,5,"My family loves this place. It's not your traditional Japanese menu. I would categorize it as fusion, but it's all good. Haven't had anything on the menu that I didn't like. My usual order is Pork Curry Katsu served in a large bowl over white rice. Great wait staff too. The location in St. Johns Town Center is connected directly to Mochi Frozen Yogurt, which is a nice stop for dessert afterwards."
9/27/2018,5,"My family's favorite place to visit for sushi and Asian food on the go. Orders are prepared fast and fully customizable, love the poke bowls. Open late which is also great. Friendly customer service. Delivery is very fast too"
12/30/2016,4,"We went for Trivia night. First tie trivia night for me and first time to Bento. Their food was scrumptious. The fact that they bring out a bowl of edamame before you even have to ask is for me a reason to squeal in delight.Food was fairly priced and tasted good,our waitress was on point, and patient with our table that I am sure must have appeared like it was never going to figure out what they wanted to order. I enjoyed sampling some of their sushi and red curry. I personally feel the curry could have had a little more flavor. It seemed a bit bland but still enjoyable. I will definitively give them another go.The trivia Guy was a little hard to hear, but he made it a point to stop at the participating tables and repeat the questions. Kudos to him for rocking it."
6/20/2018,4,Made a quick stop for a meatless lunch. I opted for the bento fried rice with veggies and eggs and it did not disappoint. The rice arrive steaming with freshness and all I added was a little soy sauce and it really did not need it. The rice was delicious and the veggies were crispy but cooked. The only thing is the ac duct is exposed and the dust needs to be cleaned off. There is a chance that it could fall in to ones food other that that it was great
3/15/2018,4,"Quick service sushi at its best. Grab a menu and choose from create your own rice or noodle bowls, bento boxes and a variety of other items or flip it over and order some delicious sushi. Our family faves are the Florida roll and the Volcano special.  They also have a variety of boba teas and kid meals. Service is generally good."
10/17/2018,4,"Thanks to the Yelp Library event, I had a coupon for a free meal upgrade to use at Bento Cafe. It has been a while since I've been here, but the food and the location are the same since the last time I remember it. The only difference is that they are now connected with Mochi next door. I came in after work right before the dinner crowd, so there were not a lot of people here. The menu is simply laid out, with all the choices you could pick. I decided to try the Monogolian brown rice bowl with shrimp, along with a side of edamame. I was able to place my order quickly and sit down at the sushi bar while I waited for my meal to go. It took a little bit of waiting, but as soon as the food hit the counter between the kitchen and the dining room, they quickly put the food in the bag and gave it to me with a smile! When I opened my bag later for dinner, I was amazed to find that the edamame was still warm and buttery, and the rice bowl was warm as well. It had plenty of flavor and big pieces of shrimp in it. I was almost full by the time I finished the bowl! Everything was delicious, so I will be back soon with my other coupon, a free spring roll with purchase of entree."
8/14/2016,5,"We just love Bentos. The quality is boss. The price is low. Consistent service and food. My most unusual requests have been accommodated. The sake is really tasty. Noodle bowls: huge and delicious! Sauces are amazingSushi: the taste is on point. Portions are large. So so fresh, every time. Salads: giant and full of ingredients, not just lettuce and dressing. You'll get so much more than you expect!We've been at least 15 times so far but we'd live here if we could."
4/16/2016,2,"Sushi from the grocery store, with a pricier tag.  Not impressed, service slow, soup was salty, and sushi felt like it was sitting under a heater.Do not recommend unless feeding kids after a baseball game because the fast food feel was the only consistency."
10/8/2014,5,"This place was pretty neat. Its like a teenage hang out at sushi place. There were a lot of young hipsters. They play regular pop modern music. You ordered at the front and get a number , wait at the table for the food. The ordering system at the front was a little hectic because there are so much to choose from and feel like I'm being rush to order so I don't hold up the line. I had spicy tuna don . it was pretty yummy and fresh. I can't wait to go back and order more. But next time o really need to study the menu before I order. This will probably be my new faverate place for awhile. The servers were very young and not too attentive. But I don't have a problem with them. They are just kids. I think they have beer and wine but I'm not sure. I was too hungry to even think about"
1/13/2016,2,Went here recently with my daughter while we were shopping for some lunch. It was nicely decorated inside and clean. I was under the assumption that this was a more sit down type of restaurant but it seemed a little more fast paced and the quality was less than desired. The green tea was sweet...very sweet and in a plastic cup. The usual sushi place we go to we could have had quit a bit more for the price paid here. The sushi on my plate and 2 teas $30 a bit over priced for what you get. Not sure if I would give this place another go.
7/15/2016,3,"Bento isn't terrible it's just not something I'd drive out of my way for. Pretty average. I think Pei Wei's food is better.Pros:- Decent pricing- Good portion sizes- Udon noodles are good- Can order online- Good for groups- Lots of food options and ways to customize your food- Served fairly quickly- Service is good even though most of it is self-serviceCons:- Food is bland- Line can take forever to get through when placing an order.- No lids for drinks. Have to ask one of the servers to get a ""seal lid"" on your drink.- Inside is small and can make for a tough time to find a seat if packed."
10/16/2019,1,Ordered pad thai to go from here. There was black hair all in it. So gross! I have brown hair so it wasn't mine. Multiple pieces of black hair. I ordered pad thai not a bowl of hair. Waste of money since I couldn't eat it. Not going back. Use caution when eating here.
3/17/2019,4,"I absolutely love bentos! I love their boba tea, and I usually get their shrimp fried rice, and for the most part they get it right.. although sometimes the egg in the fried rice is burnt so the fried rice doesn't taste that great. But overall the people are super nice and the food is always fast no matter how busy they are."
12/17/2018,4,"My favorite spot for sushi or Chinese. I always try other Chinese or sushi places but they never compare. The spicy cream chicken is phenomenal and the sushi is always very fresh, tasty, and creative. Pretty cheap spot, you walk up and order at the counter then they bring to your table. Nice, clean place. I'm a regular here."
6/25/2016,5,"Undoubtedly, one of my favorite sushi places! The food is always fresh, always amazing, always quick to receive it. I've been plenty of times for lunch and dinner and it's definitely worth every dollar. The bento boxes are more than enough food and decently priced appetizers! Definitely an amazing place for a foodie!"
7/31/2016,4,"Fast casual dining style sushi & other Asian foods. Pretty good. I like the fast casual style & prices are fairly reasonable. This is our fall back place when we can't think of anywhere else to go. Service speed is ok but they don't bring all your food out at the same time, which is mildly annoying. Overall not bad but not great."
12/23/2013,3,"While the food is decent - very similar to a Pei Wei, Zen or Fire Bowl, it wasn't good enough to bring me back. The Szechwan was lacking the Szechwan flavors I love. The sushi was fresh and well prepared but didn't have much flavor. The ginger slices had no taste. The wasabi was almost appalling. The spicy eel sauce? Not spicy at all. I am almost convinced that no one makes it like I am used to eating it in Texas. Sad times for sure. Yet, the Szechwan search will continue. While I enjoyed the meal enough, what really ruined it was ordering sushi to go and waiting 30 minutes for it. It was not busy. All of the customers before us had left already. They asked me a few times if I was waiting for something, to which I smiled and repeated my order. Internally though, you know something has gone terribly wrong when the servers are asking you what you ordered. I was given a huge apologetic smile and two extra spicy eel sauces (.50 a piece) for my long wait. I would have preferred to just get a fortune cookie."
5/7/2018,5,So much fun. And yummy! Had a poke bowl with salmon and tuna. OMG so good! Service was fast and friendly.
10/26/2017,4,"This is one of my favorite fast food sushi spots.  They have the best dynamite roll.  The Lo Mein with the fried tofu is a good noodle fix, but a little heavy on the oil.  It is a small joint, but there is outdoor seating which is nice on a crisp day.  They offer at least one Gluten-Free meal, and they will try to create a gluten free roll for you."
12/3/2018,2,"Ordered a poke bowl with ""mixed greens"". Got a poke bowl with iceberg lettuce (the kind that comes in a bag with carrots). Bit overpriced for a bowl of mostly iceberg. If they had just given me a heads up, I would've changed my order."
2/20/2020,1,They forgot to put in my order once I placed it 30 minutes ago online. Horrible customer service as they admitted that it was there mistake. Rather go somewhere else!
5/14/2016,4,I had a California roll - it was really good. The Malibu milk tea was good also. My Daughter found a piece of plastic in her Spicy Udon soup. The Manager was super cool about it and handled the situation quickly and professionally. Will we be back? Heck yeah - you could tell that my Daughter's soup was the exception and my excellent sushi was the norm.
2/11/2019,3,"My family and I have been Bento fan/regulars since they opened the one at the Town Center. We were truly elated when they opened the second one at Tinseltown. Every time we go, it's always quite a treat for everything is consistently great. The service is excellent, the atmosphere is always cool, cleanliness never fails and of course, the food is to die for. Taste wise, presentation and portions never disappoint.Unfortunately and I can't believe that I'm actually sad about this.. we will probably  stop going there. YOU GUYS STOPPED SERVING SPIDER ROLLS! Spider roll in Japanese Restaurants is a must! I know people and friends who used to (back in the 90''s) not patronize Japanese cuisine because it's something foreign and different. But once they tasted spider roll, it opened their minds and got hooked.I just would like to thank Bento for all the years we enjoyed dining there. Our kids grew up learning to appreciate the different dishes. But without the spider roll, it's just not the same for me anymore.Goo"
8/24/2018,3,"The food here isn't anything spectacular, but I crave their spicy salmon don every now and then. So easy to call in my order and have a fast pick up time. The service here is pretty solid."
5/1/2016,5,Fantastic Asian style super fresh salad. Sauce is spicy but can be served aside. Highly recommend. Staff is friendly. Access to free lemon water. Great place.
9/19/2018,5,The sushi here is divine. Every time I have $3.25-$ 11.50 to spend after bills are paid this place is my first stop‼ their prices are decent and the food is delicious ‼‼‼ Staff are friendly as well
11/4/2018,4,Visited this place last night and absolutely loved the food. We ordered their signature fried rice bowl and pad thai which was level 3 spicy. Also ordered salmon spicy classic roll on the side and I wish I had some space for more food.Their service was pretty fast and staff was very friendly. We loved this place and will definitely visit again to try other things on their menu.
10/31/2019,4,Food is good but sometimes the wait time is unacceptable. I've been there maybe like 5 times with my husband and either his food takes forever to come out or he's done with his food by the time my dish comes out. This kinda kills the vibe. BUT the poke bowls are fresh and tasty and have never disappointed!
7/5/2019,2,"Location: Town center. This was our family favorite sushi place but the quality of both the service and food is deteriorating. Today the sushi for 2 people came out in one plate and no separate plates, no cookies for the kids, no ginger and no wasabi until we asked. No napkins; really!!!I have to ask for napkins, ginger and wasabi? This place needs a better manager."
6/17/2015,5,"This is our go-to place when we're at the towncenter. Awesome prices and awesome food. Sushi is on point and the bento boxes are delightful. Bulgogi Chicken is always tasty and it can be ordered to your preferred spice level. If you feel like indulging try the Spicy Cream Chicken or Shrimp! I'm a little disappointed they stopped the Boba Tea reward cards (after 8 punches you get the next one free) however if you still have any they will honor them. Regardless, that's not going to keep us away. We're addicted!It is a smaller establishment and seating is limited. It's a first-come, first-served concept. Therefore, if you have a large party I'd recommend going to their sister restaurant Bento Red on southside. Larger scale with the same great atomsphere."
7/28/2018,4,"Sushi rolls are amazing! This is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Jacksonville.  They have a large variety for sushi lovers and picky kids.  The only negative is its popularity makes for the line to go out the door.  Never the less, it didn't take long to reach the cashier."
1/29/2016,3,"Good variety of menu choices. Atmosphere screams fast food. Service is spotty as we have visited several times in 60 days. Four ppl in our most recent visit, the food was brought to our table 4 separate times! We wanted to eat together! Each dish came 10-12 mins apart! Really?"
8/1/2017,5,"We originally went to Bento Red (Tinseltown), but due to the 30 minute wait we made our way to Bento Blue (town center). This location is very small compared to the Tinseltown location, but it's still just as good. This location is a walk up and order, and grab a number location which is different from the other location. We walked up and ordered an orange chicken bowl, a dynamite roll, Philadelphia roll, and rainbow roll. We got our number, and made our drinks and looked for a seat. We found a booth and our food was out in a matter of minutes. The orange chicken is so good, I swear it never disappoints. It's always hot, and the chicken is always perfect. Our sushi rolls were also no disappointment. I am a sucker for sushi, so wherever I can find good sushi will always be a favorite for me. I have never had a bad experience with Bento, but I have never actually tried one of their Bento boxes. I guess I'll have to plan a day to go back so I can do that. Sushi date anyone?"
5/11/2017,4,"Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Only issue I ever had here was I ordered the edamame and it came with sugar instead of salt. So I went to the counter to let them know and someone at the register told me ""that's how it comes"". I've ordered it MANY times here and it's NEVER come with sugar............. but okay."
12/8/2019,5,"Attended a special event at the Tinseltown location on their back patio this week. The food was delicious and the service was extremely accommodating. If you want to plan a special event, I highly recommend using this location. The manager, Kevin Hardee, did an outstanding job to work with our group. From previous times, I know that their dumplings, Bento Boxes, and other menu items are yummy! BTW - their Thursday Trivia night is a blast! A good to location for friends and family!"
8/26/2017,5,"The staff kept things moving, the food is delivered promptly, and the quality and flavor is outstanding!!!   Our family loved it.  We will be back!"
4/3/2016,5,"This place is very good. They have a huge selection of sushi rolls, bento boxes, bubble teas, salads (with fish on them of course) etc. It is very casual, just order your food at the register, go find a seat and they will deliver it to you. I am particularly fond of the salmon don bowl. It's raw salmon, avocado, pickled seaweed, and cucumber slices on top of rice with a semi spicy sauce on top of it all. Yum!! It can get very busy here, especially at weekend lunch time. I find the best time to go is after the lunch rush. Very kid friendly, too."
10/22/2017,3,This restaurant is very cute. I love the staff and everything is always clean and the food always tastes fresh.  I haven't tried to sushi but I have tried a few different items and nothing ever tastes like it's suppose to. I ordered Green Curry recently and it taste like spicy hibachi.  I'll probably go back because it has the best boba in town but I am about to give up on the food.
11/10/2019,1,"Food came out late and at seperate times. Mine was cold. Asked to be heated or remade. No apology. Another 20 mins go by. Asked waitress how long, was ignored the first time. 2nd time I asked was told I dont know. I said can you check, no response. Asked for manager and got refund for my food only. Worst bento ever. The orlando locatoons were good. Not this one. No better than a fast food place with high priced food."
3/8/2018,4,"This was literally the best General Tso chicken ive ever had in my life. I went here on a friday for lunch and the place was packed. I knew the food was going to be good when I saw that. The prices are fair, especially for a restaurant at the Town Center."
11/10/2017,1,This is my first time here and this is not a very good experience. The line is really long and the cashier keep talking to their friends took like 10 to 15 for them to finish..... plz do something about it
5/13/2015,3,"Not bad, I was surprised how many sushi options there are in the area, but would consider this place in the future. More of a casual place than I was expecting; you order at the cashier and then leave your number on display for them to bring it out to you, so not full waiter service. They do have some outdoor seating which is nice, and are also connected to the yogurt place next door, so makes for a nice one stop shop. Sushi didn't blow me away, but wasn't expecting the world and they had a couple beers you could buy in a bottle, which was a nice option. They also had a small sushi bar, so was a strange mix of formal and not formal."
8/15/2019,1,This restaurant is filthy! I go here often and it looks worse every time. The food is pretty good but I wonder how clean the kitchen is since the rest of the place is absolutely disgusting. Sorry Bento I can't return to your dirty establishment anymore.. which breaks my heart since I loved this food.
8/8/2018,5,"I visit Bento Blue at the Towncenter at least once a week, often more. I have nothing bad to say about this wonderful place. The staff have made an effort to recognize me as I come in and are always kind and helpful. The create a poke bowl and build your own veggie roll are my two favorites. With the spicy cream chicken right behind! The prices are reasonable and the food always tastes fresh. Definitely try their spicy mayo sauce as it is one of my favorites I've had."
2/24/2013,3,"Not impressed by the food at all. It's not bad at all but I don't think I'll  likely say ""lets go to Bentos"" again. It does taste fresh and well seasoned tho. I was excited to go to this place based on the user photos,fell a bit short of my lofty expectations. It is forgettable. I didn't have sushi maybe I'll try that next."
1/23/2015,5,Bento has become my favorite new dinner spot. The prices aren't too sour and the food is very different from the other Asian restaurants in Jacksonville. The atmosphere of Bento Red and Blue is so contemporary and vibrant that I instantly feel cool upon walking in. Bento Blue is attached to the Mochi frozen yogurt bar which is very convenient if you're looking for a quick dessert after. Every time I go to bento I get either their Una Don or their Spicy Tuna Don which can be found on their raw menu. Definitely explore the menu though! There is no wrong choice!
1/25/2017,5,"Love. The place.   Great place before movie, Friday better go early.  Line is long on movie night"
1/24/2018,1,"Just order two soups for me and my wife after paid and waited for 10-15 minutes I was inform that the broth run out so they can't make what I ordered, I just upset because they should not make people wait and then just say sorry. Very disappointed of this location this is the second time this happen to us."
11/14/2014,4,"I've only been a few times but I really enjoyed it...the food is really great and the presentation is fantastic.The place is usually busy so sometimes you might have to wait in line to order at the register but usually it's not too bad...they have really delicious sushi rolls,rice bowls, appetizers and boba tea. I will say I find it unusual that they charge you 50 cents extra for a little thing of shrimp sauce...and also the last time I went they actually charged me wrong and I had to get a credit but everything worked out just fine and I will be back again!"
4/17/2017,4,Everything was delicious- the only downside is getting into Bento! They are so busy! I go as often as possible and every time I am at town center
5/23/2010,4,"I remember my boss asking me one morning, excitedly, if I had heard about Bento opening up at the Town Center. I smiled and nodded my head yes. And then proceeded to research what this Bento place was that she referred to. [You must understand pretending to know about everything your boss mentions, to your boss, even if you don't... right?]Well, found out it was a sushi joint and, me loving sushi, I immediately went to check the place out. Was I ever pleased. Bento is awesome!I love that they offer Noodle Bowls. Do you know how long I have been waiting for Jax to open a place that serves Noodle Bowls? Probably not, but it has been a while. While the Noodle Bowls are great [Shrimp Udon Noodle Soup Bowl is top choice!], they offer a lot of other great menu items to choose from. The Bento Boxes are very popular and include your choice of meat and preparation that is served with noodles, rice, ginger salad and Asian green beans. And lets not forget the Sushi. The sushi is ah-may-zing. It's really really good. I am salivating just thinking about it. Every day they have a special roll that they prepare and I suggest taking them up on it. MMMM. If you are at the Town Center doing some shopping this is a great place to hit up for lunch or dinner. Or, if you just want some good Pan Asian cuisine, its worth the trip even without the shopping!Team Bento!"
4/3/2018,5,"This is a definitely a go-to! It's tasty, quick, inexpensive and super clean. Try to go early because it gets crazy busy at lunch!"
11/4/2017,5,"Simply my favorite Sushi bar in Jacksonville. Good service, great food, affordable prices. Everything that students can dream of."
5/27/2019,1,"Poor service. Our family went to this Bento to eat at past 2 pm. Some empty tables. We ordered bento box, udon noodle soup, and chicken curry. Seated right away. Then food came. No soup spoon was given to us. When we asked for soup spoon , waitress said they ran out of soup spoon ; and no apologies. No plans of solving my issue. She just left our table. I went to the counter to speak to someone who looks like directing flow of food and got same  answer ""sorry we ran out of soup spoons"".  Really? How am I supposed to eat my lunch???? Then I was given a plastic small teaspoon to eat my soup. What a joke. To think the restaurant was not even full . Won't be back."
3/27/2015,4,"Tonight I came for sushi, simply because I'm in the mood for it tonight. I got a sushi combo box with the Tokyo Rose Roll and the Spicy Hotate Roll. My sister accompanied me and ordered Tofu Pad Thai. Which she said was ""pretty good"". My sushi was well prepared and the environment is nice. Personally I think that Sushi Combo Boxes are a better deal than a sushi buffet. You may pay the same but ultimately you get enough sushi that actually tastes like something. I really enjoyed my meal and night. Mochi is next door for quick and delicious dessert. Overall, this is a wonderful venue with delicious food and a great atmosphere. 4 stars"
8/16/2017,4,"This location is small compared to Bento Red which is down the street, so if it's busy seats will be limited. Other than that the food is good, they have plenty of dishes available. Majority of dishes can be modified so that they fit a vegan / vegetarian diet. I was nervous to try the tofu because it's usually a hit or miss but it was fantastic !"
5/30/2015,4,One of our go-to quick dinner spots. The sushi is always excellent. Their fried rice is one of my usual dishes. I tried their lo mein last night and it was so salty that I didn't even finish it. Always had a great meal besides last night. Usually packed. Nice indoor and outdoor seating. Friendly staff that keeps the place clean.The Mexican roll is amazing & worth ordering!
7/17/2015,4,"We really enjoyed this place. The fish tasted fresh and they give you a decent portion size considering the price is probably some of the cheapest sushi Iv experienced. We tried the yellow curry in the bento box and was good. Love that they have brown rice options. Also their sushi rice is good and to me that's what makes great sushi. If there was a bento by our home we would visit regularly. It does feel pretty ""chain"" restaurantish, because it is. The service was very nice and helped me choose which roll to get. Love that it was attached to Mochi for dessert!"
2/6/2015,4,"All the sushi is VERY FRESH.Smoked Salmon was beyond fresh/delicious. Lunch time is very loud and busy, but they do keep it pretty quick.So much so the presentation suffers a tad because its messy.Also pretty pricey for a fast casual dining place."
3/13/2018,5,"Kind staff + great food = good time for my friends & I! It's cafe style so we don't get all of our food together but anything that took too long, staff gave us a complimentary soup. My friend got clear and she said it was ""poppin'"". Will definitely be back"
8/27/2017,1,"This is the worst Asian food I have tried since I got in US. The curry bowl only has zucchini and carrot as veggie. The beef noodle soup tastes like the water left in the pot after cleaning. A bulgogi bowl doesn't taste like bulgogi, but have some sour taste. After we tried our food, I start to wonder why this place is packed......but most of other people ordered sushi, so I guess the sushi might not be like this..... Bento in GAINESVILLE is way more better."
4/13/2015,4,I like the quality but I don't like how they nickel and dime you on extras. I like the spicy tuna don and the special Mexican is amazing.
7/4/2010,4,A buddy of mine has traveled through out the country and insisted we go here for sushi.  He seems to think it is the freshest in town. I tried to debate with him on all the great sushi places in town and he wouldn't budge.  I have been converted now too!I got the Tuna Nigiri.  Two pieces of good size for $4.  To top it off I then ordered the Dynamite Roll (?).  The Salmon was still raw on the inside and the outside was fried just enough for crunch.  Perfection on a plate!  It was $9 and had 8 pieces instead of the normal six.  The decor is definitely Asian Modern with Blue and Black decor and stainless steel.  Makes you feel hip and with it even while wearing shorts and flip flops.
12/4/2017,5,$10 sushi box is my favorite! Saturday lunch can be a little crowded but outdoor seating makes for a nice catch-up with friends. Walking distance to many stores and connected to mochi for frozen yogurt.
11/4/2014,3,Quick place with OK food. Sushi Combo Box is the best deal. Ginger Salad and Miso Soup were not good. Sushi was good.
5/16/2015,5,Really good sushi and reasonable price! Love that you order at the counter and that they bring it to your table fast. I think the sushi is very good and I now crave their sushi often! If you love sushi then you won't regret trying this place!
1/15/2017,3,"This is our number one choice for fast food. Don't come here if you are looking for a great sushi place,  but it is good for a quick and inexpensive Japanese/Asian food fix."
6/2/2020,3,"myself and 2 other friends went to bentos we waited in line and ordered in line and we didn't know or see the sign where it said no cash and A guy name david was so rude about my friends and i not having a card and we went and someone offered to pay for us another lady with curly blonde hair in a pony tail she seemed very very bothered about someone paying for us The customer service was really bad except this one curly headed teenage guy with glasses and light-skin, food was good thought."
4/30/2017,5,Huge fan of the spicy salmon/tuna don bowl. I also love making my own. Pretty obsessed tbh
4/20/2019,4,Good bowls and very tasty. The sushi rolls are ok. The noodles are better with the bowls than the rice. The service is slow because the teens running the register have no sense of urgency. Overall good place to eat
6/9/2017,5,"Best sushi in town, best bowls as well. So much food for your money. I have never been disappointed. This is definitely my favorite restaurant here in Jacksonville."
6/11/2014,1,"I really wish that I could give ZERO stars...I have no idea how anyone makes it through a meal at this place. I ended up at Bento on a Sunday evening that happened to coincide with Mother's Day. My companion and I wanted something ""asian"" but all of the Thai restaurants were closed. I didn't want takeout Chinese, and I had heard good things about Bento.Simply put, I will NEVER take restaurant advice again from someone who can recommend Bento as a ""good choice"". I had a sinking feeling as soon as I walked in. Most of the customers were teenagers and younger children. The place was vaguely cool looking but the tables were left unbussed. Against our better judgement, we decided to order. I got something with tofu, companion got chicken katsu. We got spring rolls as an app. The first table that we tried to sit at was located under a leaky spot in the ceiling. I wasn't surprised. We were able to get a new table fairly quickly. The cool ""freestyle"" drink machine was dripping wet and the area around it was not very well maintained. To be fair though, the drink machine was clearly being used as entertainment by the kids, so there's that. My food was out before we even had time to get our drinks. That sounds like a good thing, until I tasted the food. Whoa nelly, I haven't had food that bad in years. The sauce that was on the tofu had so much ginger in it, it tasted like hand sanitizer. It was lukewarm and had been poured onto some equally lukewarm tofu that had clearly been microwaved at some point. The salad dressing suffered a similar fate. The rice was overcooked and unfortunate as well. The room-temperature noodles were edible. The whole thing was a disaster.The spring rolls were your standard frozen and reheated variety. They ended up being the best part of the meal, by a huge margin.While I sat there angrily with my horrific meal, my companion looked on with a rumbly tummy, as his food took an inordinate amount of time to show up. We had to remind the staff about it twice. When he finally got his food, he ate it with a sad look on his face. He was starving so he accepted it. He said that his food also tasted like hand sanitizer because of the amount of ginger in it.We were both very unhappy after that experience. In fact, our experience at Bento was so bad that it has become an in-joke between the two of us. That's not a good thing..."
7/29/2015,5,"Outstanding place. Listen, this isn't super high end sushi. But it's above decent, and at a really good price. It's very ""Americanized,"" and that's just fine by me. The combo box is a great bargain, and they have a huge selection to choose from. Really friendly service too. Get the shrimp sauce."
5/21/2019,4,Nice love this place and the pao pao chicken. So yummy yummy in my tummy tummy . Highly recommended this place. Plus they have frozen yogurt right beside it .
1/2/2014,5,"My friend put me on this place and I was addicted for like 3 weeks. I prob spent 100$ in that time. lol This is where I go to treat my self. Their Sushi BOMB!, their orange chick BOMB-digity and the Sweet sour chicken BOMB.org/mylife. Sorry for sounding so wack but this place is amazing and real chicken is used ..White meat not.. chicken pieces or what nots. lol"
11/29/2017,5,"My family and I were traveling over the holiday weekend. On Monday, we stopped for lunch on our way to Orlando. We eat at the Bento near our home fairly regularly, as had some expectations. The food and service were as awesome as always, however, my wife forgot her purse on the back of the chair as we left. She did not realize it was missing until we were arriving at our destination, 2 hours later. I just wanted to thank the team for not only finding it, but holding it for us to pick up the next day.  Thankfully, nothing was missing. What a great staff, professional and good natured.  Truly a great experience, considering the self imposed four-hour round trip.  We will definitely stop in again when we are in the area."
1/5/2014,2,"**Update:My past few visits to Bento have been let downs.  I feel like quality has taken a dive.  Boba balls in the tea were hard (not fresh - think refrigerated rice), salad in my bento box had minute dribble of dressing over dry rubbery lettuce.  Meat was tough.  sadface.  I'm pretty much done going back."
6/13/2017,3,Food is amazing and fast. Great place to stop for a quick bite of fresh sushi. Service needs some work. Food always arrives before my sake! They look well staffed but the floor is filthy and the line is long with plenty of people standing around to open one of the empty registers.
3/14/2017,4,Service was fast and their is military discount! 4 stars for sushi ! Didn't really enjoy the lo mein I tried... but would definitely come back for sushi
7/3/2014,4,I enjoy the tuna don here! It has become my go to choice for lunch. The salmon is also great.
2/16/2014,4,"After being a die-hard Bento fan for years going to the original Gainesville location during college, I was stoked to hear they had opened a Jacksonville location in the town center after I moved here.This is my go-to pick-up place for nights when I'm too tired to cook or just need a sushi fix. I've never had a bad experience here, and I've been here A LOT. The servers are always nice, even when they are slammed with customers. I tend to stick to the chicken pad thai rice bowl and a rotating selection of sushi for the side. Also, make sure to try the boba tea (I've tried tons of flavors and haven't been disappointed yet).You get really large portions of food for the price (I usually can't finish my rice bowls and save the rest for lunch the next day), and the sushi is always made fresh by the chefs right in front of you. I think the quality of food is phenomenal for the price; I've paid much more for lackluster Asian food at other restaurants. At Bento, you can expect to pay under $10 for pretty much everything on the menu, and the flavors are always spot-on.My biggest tip: if you don't like waiting in line, call ahead for a pick-up order and take it home to eat or out on the restaurant's patio.Soo happy to have Bento in Jacksonville! Once you try it, you'll be hooked."
6/5/2015,5,This place is awesome! It's a little different in the ordering and seating. Has the feel of fast food. But the sushi is first class. So far it's the best sushi I have had in Jax. The food is always good and consistent. Parking can be a little difficult at dinner time. There is always takeout too. -Clean-Friendly-good food-5 Stars!
2/19/2017,4,Food was delicious. Clean and beautifully decorated restaurant. Service was friendly and prompt. Love the sushi bar!
10/19/2016,5,"Love this place, always so good... service was fast and friendly. And the food tastes just great! Highly recommend it"
8/7/2015,4,"Bento at town center, take it for what it is. The sushi is pretty good and the bento boxes are great and will definitely fill your ever-expanding tummy with the large portion. The chicken Katsu is really good thin slices of fried white meat chicken with a crispy breading on the outside that even my American friend who has never eaten Asian food before agrees it's good. However, I would not recommend any noodle stir fry dish or boba drink. The noodles stir fry is a yellow glutinous noodle that does not taste that well in my opinion,  and the bobas don't taste like their intended flavor. Sushi and bento boxes you can't go wrong...service is always good too."
4/10/2016,4,"Really tasty! I've been here several times and have always been really happy with the food.  The take out can be a little slow, but it is usually worth the wait! Also, I always have leftovers."
8/22/2014,3,"Bento Cafe is our usual go-to place for a quick lunch when we are near Town Center area.  I usually order their chicken yellow curry bento, asking for them to add more spice (otherwise it's just really mild).  The yellow curry is not overly sweet, which is nice.  I've also tried a wide variety of their other dishes and sushi.  Bulgogi beef, pork chop noodle soup, for example, are also pretty good.It is a semi self service joint: you place your order at the counter, they give you a number stand, you grab your drink (if you ordered any) at the cool Coke machine, and then seat yourself to wait for server to bring you your food.  A few issues here and there, but a fairly consistent one especially when they are busy, is that food do not come out at the same time for the entire table.  Sometimes it is minor, a few min late, sometimes it's downright annoying (everyone else eat while you watch).  Sometimes I notice their yellow curry is not consistent.  A few times it is bland and other times it's stellar.  Nevertheless, it is a pretty good place for a quick lunch if going early or late to avoid the crowd."
3/11/2015,5,"One of my Jacksonville favorite places. The ambience and environment of this place is great. It's a casual, cool environment that leaves guests feeling comfortable. Can get loud just like any restaurant.The menu is large, but never went wrong ordering food here. My favorite without a doubt would probably have to be the sushi combo with the Mt. Fuji roll and always something different. 16 pieces of sushi for 10 bucks, along with little extras make it perfect. There was one week where I was there four days in a row with one day going twice in the same day. Never leave disappointed and always full."
10/21/2016,5,So yummy I can't wait to go back. I tried the shrimp pad Thai which was a big portion and made perfectly. The staff is nice and they are quick. Clean environment. Def recommend.
5/3/2015,4,"The sushi tastes very fresh, and the service is good. They have a pretty wide variety of choices. They also have some deals, so you can dine for under $11 if you get a sushi box, and it's a good amount of food. On the weekdays from 3-6 they have buy two rolls get one free. They also have also have rice bowls with meat and hibachi style food if you don't like sushi, but I only come for the sushi, although my friend liked the chicken he got when he came with me."
3/4/2014,5,Haters love to hate on this place.  I like the sushi and the noodle bowls.  Can't beat the location either.This place delivers through doorstep delivery.  We've done it several times when we were feeling lazy.  Sushi delivery is when you know Jacksonville isn't a hick town any longer.My miso soup today is full of tofu and very tasty.  I used to eat here back in my college days at UF in Gainesville.  I'm glad to see they are doing well as a business.  They are opening another location right down the street in Tinseltown.
2/3/2017,4,I had recently come back from a visit to VA where I had tried Pokéworks for the first time. It was so good and I was super bummed they aren't down here. So I was very happy to see that Bento Cafe had poké bowls! I got one with salmon and tuna and it really good. I just wish the rice had been a bit stickier.
6/21/2017,4,"This is a great food stop, and you can't go wrong coming here if you're in the area.  Even if you don't end up liking it, it's a great stop in jacksonville"
11/28/2014,3,"Waited in a long line to order. No drink pricing on the menu, I see why. Over price drinks. After sitting down and waiting for our food to find out the shrimp sauce cost extra. Really after spending $30 for lunch on my debit card I didn't have any cash for sauce. Needless to say I'm not impressed at all. The dynamite to roll was deep-fried it was good but it wasn't hot. The saukee was lukewarm I like mine hot."
9/8/2016,5,"I discovered Bento while taking my son to UNF.  You order at the counter, get a number, find a seat if you can - they are so busy! - wait for your food to be delivered and DEVOUR it!  I always hope the line is long enough so I can figure out what I want from their pretty extensive menu.  There are so many options and EVERYTHING is delicious!  I love the monitor that displays the dishes because then I get to see which item makes me drool more - and that is what I order.  All the plates are filling.  Excellent!"
5/2/2016,3,"Bento café is a place where if you want something fast and somewhat inexpensive, this is the place. The food overall is okay. Its not a 5 star but its good and edible. I used to come here if I had a long day at work or just wanted something fast and get it to go. At first I thought the food was pretty good but as I have gone the last few times it seems they have been slacking. Not sure if its just been my luck but I love there Pad Thai and its been pretty dry the last times I got it."
4/26/2016,5,Very friendly staff! Everyone is always smiling and working hard. Food is amazing !! Get the Bali Hai Mango roll!
6/11/2014,4,"I haven't tried Bentos before today. Great atmosphere, food, and service. Try too get in before noon for lunch, the line really becomes steady. #asiancuisine #delish #bentos"
2/13/2017,5,I will be back. Affordable and great sushi. I like the drinks and atmosphere. Love the location and outside seating.
4/30/2016,2,"Not bad. The rice was pretty plain. The portions of fish were small. The rolls were really 1/2 rolls. The fish was pretty good, except for the octopus. The octopus (taco) was not good. I won't be coming back."
1/15/2018,1,"Very disappointed today with Bento!  Usually no problems, and good food, however today the service or shall I say LACK there of!  Placed an order for carry out, server came over with bag and said, ""are you waiting for a carry out order.""  I said, ""Yes"" (we had a number so I figured the server could read the number on the table we were sitting at and the number on the ticket to match it up.  We left, 30 minutes later, getting ready to eat our food and it was not your take out order.  I drive back and tell them it was wrong.  The person at the register said oh yes there was a mix up, here is your order. IT IS NOW ALMOST AN HOUR OLD!  SHE TRIED TO GIVE ME THE ORIGINAL ORDER. I have not idea if someone had taken it out of Bento and brought it back.  I told her I do not want food that is over an hour old.  She places a new ticket and said it would be expedited.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I GET A SORRY, AND NOTHING ELSE, NOT EVEN A CUP FOR WATER WHILE I WAIT.  After waiting 8 minutes, I am told by BRENNA that they are waiting for Odon noodles. I tell her I am not very happy with the service. BRENNA then precedes to tell me it is MY FAULT that I got the wrong carry out order!!!! OMG are you kidding me!  By this time I am just livid!  I ask her her name and she REFUSED to give it to me.  If you are in the service industry you better learn how to deal with people.  I am so disappointed with Bento and how they treat their customers.  Shame on you for your lack of customer service.  I hope you teach BRENNA some manner."
9/14/2016,4,"The team I work with loves to go out for lunch. This has become one of their staples. Someone recommended the Spicy Tuna Tataki Don (with brown rice), based upon the type of food that I typically order. I love this low fat, high protein option for its flavor and fresh ingredients. I need to expand and try other options, but I love my mainstay dish and the team loves all of their selections."
12/17/2016,2,"Not impressed. I had the udon soup with a side of shrimp tempura. The soup tasted a little off (maybe too much dashi?); the shrimp was lacking the signature quality of tempura. The batter was heavy which gave a hard crunch, not the light coating one expects with a tempura. The flavor of the shrimp was non-existent.   I had to ask for the tempura dipping sauce and it was  horrendous. I swear she just brought a small container of pure soy sauce.The atmosphere is fun and open, but not somewhere that I would revisit. Maybe I am a little jaded because I have been searching for a good noodle place for a long while... NE Florida needs a good authentic noodle place. Until then.. I'll make my own"
10/22/2009,3,"Since I'm a Mochi fiend, I've also been watching the progress of Bento's opening next door.  The smiley girl that kinda manages Mochi is now working at Bento too and she told me they have the same owner.  Thanks Smiley girl.  No...not you...the other one...yeah...you.Anyway, so I was kinda lookin' forward to trying out Bento to see what they would bring.  I need A game here in Jacksonville...a city of B game wannabe's.So, went with a friend to Bento today for lunch.  As a dutiful Yelper, I tried a few things on the menu just to make it a more appropriate review.Hmm...so they are Pan-Asian, meaning they try to do a lot of different things at once.  I am not sure that's a good thing, but I'll roll with it.  I dunno how you can expect to be an expert at making really good Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Sushi...but that's what they are going for.  So they have ""Cantonese Pork Chops"", General Tso's Chicken, Pad Thai, Katsu, Bulgogi and some soupy noodle dishes just to name a few.  As I said, it's quite broad.  Perhaps they are just counting on Jax people not to know the difference.  I'm sure that's it.We ordered 3 things...the Spicy Korean Chicken, the Creamy Spicy Shrimp, and the Cantonese Pork Chops.  The chicken was good though not spicy.  It was stir-fried chicken with a lot of both green and white onions.  In fact, it was mostly onion. The pork chops were lightly glazed in a sweet, almost BBQ sauce (though not so tomatoey), served cut and boneless over white rice.  Each of the above was ordered as a Bento box, meaning it came with some flash fried green beans, salad, rice and some chow mein noodles.   The green beans were warm, but good.  The rest of the sides were more of an after thought.  Wilted lettuce, luke warm noodles with a few pieces of cabbage...The Creamy Spicy Shrimp were kind of embarrassing.  The flavor of the sauce was good...but you can find that same, thick, sweet orange sauce across the way at Panda Express.  The shrimp themselves were ridiculous, precooked, super tiny, pieces of mushiness, hidden amongst a blanket of batter.  Plus they only give you 6.  Hello...this is the coast...Mayport is right over there (points) and they have fresh shrimp.Portions were average.  We had 3 dishes but I was still hungry enough to get 12 oz of Mochi after.  Perhaps they planned it that way.We each had a boba tea drink that was good.  I had Milk Tea and my friend had green tea.  I'd go back for that.The decor was nice.  Clean, modern.  Black, box lit tables, blue tones throughout.  There were both booths and small tables.Service was obviously new and figuring out how to serve.  They were nice though, just new at it.  You order from the counter (where the Smiley girl works) and they give you a number and you go sit down.  They then bring you the food.Overall...A-ok...not 4 stars...and definitely not 5 stars like Mochi next door.  I'd give 3.5 for the effort.  I'll go back, just to try other things.  If they get some better shrimp, they might get another star.  If they served beer and wine that'd help too."
8/8/2015,5,"This is a go-to dinner spot when I'm at Towncenter -- perfect for those who are always wearing wrinkled clothes and can't afford valet. Seriously, there's a lot of high end places at Towncenter, surrounded by a lot of Chick-fil-a and Pollo Tropical around the perimeter. Bento is a perfect in-between for me. I usually go for the sushi bowl -- not sure why. It's like deconstructed sushi and the salmon-tuna combo is divine. I can't remember the name. But anyway, you get big chunks of sashimi atop a bowl of rice and it's less than $9. Can't beat that! I sent a picture to my out-of-town friend once and he predicted it was more like $25! The servings are plentiful. They also have the fancy soda machine with the touchscreen, so if you're into that..."
2/28/2011,4,"Right away I loved Bento Cafe.  The only confusing thing was the sign above the building that say Pan-Asian Cuisine and not Bento Cafe.  I understand that is their slogan, but it can be confusing to a first timer.That being said, I fell in love with their Bento boxes.  You pick the main portion of the meal and they serve it to you on a tray with little compartments with other little servings of things like noodles, salad with ginger dressing, broccoli and an orange.I need to go back to try some of the other offerings, although I just know I will be tempted to get another Bento box!"
3/9/2013,1,"I'm a foodie at heart. So when I go to a place, and 30 minutes after I've eaten at a place I need to use the rest room, I tend to be leery of going back. This is what happened when I ate here. I even gave it another chance since, I figure, everyone has an off night-maybe it was a fluke. But it happened. Two more times, in fact. Now, you can say that maybe I just have a weak stomach. Or that I just pick really bad entrees. Doesn't matter. When I spend money to eat somewhere, I'm not expecting to have to make an emergency restroom run because the food didn't agree with me! Suffice to say, I will NEVER go back. Three times was bad enough."
11/2/2009,3,"Recently gave the new Bento Café a try.  We have been to other bento café locations (Gainesville and Orlando), and thought their food was decent for the price.  So we are pretty happy that there is now a Bento in Jacksonville as well.First of all, as you walk in, there is a person to greet you and ask if you have tried Bento Café before.  Smart move, because many people looked lost.  Having someone at the entrance to go over the ordering process and the menu is indeed very helpful.  Since we are familiar with the menu, we jumped ahead and ordered.  The four of us ordered the Cantonese pork chop bento, the Bulgogi beef bento, the Japanese pork chop bento, and tempura shrimp udon.  And of course, I had to try a buba tea.The bentos were all good.  I especially liked the bulgogi.  However, the udon was disappointing, not so much the noodle or the broth, but the 3 little tempura shrimp... how sad.  The boba was decent, but a bit too sweet and too much milk.  Well, it's a tall order to make boba in this town when Aroma makes excellent boba.Overall, the welcoming atmosphere, friendly service, convenient location (when shopping at the Town Center), decent food and price makes this a good place for a quick meal when shopping at the Town Center.  Of course, being next to Mochi helps a lot too."
9/7/2018,1,We come to bentos frequently it's usually a good experience and great food. It was a Friday night but we got the main course meals in 15 minutes but never got are sushi chicken tempura. We asked a server 3x and almost finished are meals till we asked for the money back. The manager (Jessica) said they accidentally gave it to the wrong table and if we still wanted it that it should be out soon. We declined and asked for the money back and the money for the Bobo tea. The manager didn't offer any incentive . Well thanks for starting the night with apologies and bad experience . Won't be going here again.
4/22/2013,4,"A nice Asian fusion restaurant right next to the Mochi froyo place. These two should do the trick in fulfilling your Asian food cravings around Jacksonville!I thought we were waiting for a table when the lady asked me for my order. I was apparently in line to put in an order, prior to being led to a table. The menu was pretty straightforward, so it didn't take long to decide on my lunch.The atmosphere is fairly casual and trendy. Prices are comparable to bentos in NYC. Their udon noodles and Korean bbq over rice were delicious. Would like to return to try other things."
11/2/2013,2,"This place if you look at the floor,wall, Restroom is so dirty. The owner must never care of it.  Service and food was alright. I just can't sit down and eat to look at those finger print on the wall."
7/31/2015,5,"I've been coming here for several years and never been disappointed. This isn't your typical New York style Chinese take-out place. The food is amazing!! My favorite is the udon stir fry noodle bowl but there are many other Asian dishes to choose from. Also, food is served to you within 5-10 min. Expect a rush during lunch on weekdays as this is a popular spot."
10/14/2019,1,"Hoping for a great new place to take my family for dinner. We came here to order boba tea as dessert, and after reviewing the menu, we were excited to come here in the near future to try the food on the menu. We ordered three large taro boba teas. Now I am not a professional boba tea connoisseur, but the boba tea I received was not only a pale cream color, it tasted nothing like taro. I've had taro boba tea many times over many years, and this was not it. When I asked if the boba tea we received was taro, they said yes. I accepted it and went back outside to my family, but it just wasn't taro. I went in a second time, and stated that it just didn't taste or look like taro at all. The lady stated they got a new manufacturer, and it isn't as purple anymore. There was never any attempt or concern of customer satisfaction. I threw my boba tea away and won't be taking my family back. There are better places with better service."
5/31/2010,3,"Finally tried out Bento cause we like to get yogurt at Mochi. First I'll start off with the bad. The teas. I love milk tea with boba. I've drank it in Las Vegas, Orlando, New York, Miami, Vancouver, Sydney, Jacksonville and Taipei (where it originated). The one here was nothing to rave about. It's like milk with a touch of tea. It's suppose to be the other way around. The boba was fine for my taste. Just the milk tea was not too milky. The worst was the thai tea that my girlfriend order. She's had thai tea many times before however this was not even close to thai tea. I tasted it and it goes from a tea flavor to a sour flavor at the end. No way should it be sour. It was truly disgusting. We asked a server if it was definitely thai tea. He did offer for something else but we declined since they were 0 for 2 on speciality teas. Horrible thai tea. The good is the food. We enjoyed it. I had the bulgolgi beef. Good flavor. Not too salty. The lo mein noodles that came with it were dry. The ginger salad was ok. I've had better in other Japanese restaurants. She had the Japanese curry chicken. She enjoyed it. Atmosphere was okay. Loud music in there. Food came out quickly. Prices were reasonable. Just don't drink the tea."
5/26/2013,4,"We really liked it.  I got the red curry with chicken.  The menu gave it one pepper, and sure enough it had some heat, but was really good.  I got the bento plate, which to the unfamiliar comes with some white rice, the de riguer iceberg+ginger dressing salad, some Asian green beans, and some asian style noodles.  A really filling plate of food for $9.  Daughter got the shrimp pad thai with noodles (I think that it's like getting it with extra noodles).  It was a huge bowl of pad thai for 9 or 10 bucks. Wife got some kind of soy chicken that allegedly had some heat, but did not have as much as my red curry.Really liked it, need to get this franchise to Atlanta!"
11/1/2009,4,"I went shopping today at Town Center mall, and it came upon lunchtime.  I am not a big fan of the chain restaurants there, and, being a party of 1, wanted somewhere that I would not be lost in.  I started off for home with the intention of grabbing something interesting, if it presented itself, and if not, find something on the way home.I saw Bento Cafe from the road, and it triggered my interest.  I drove by and noticed that it was busy, and that it was advertising itself as Pan Asian, but definitely had sushi.  I walked in and there was a line of 12 or so waiting to be seated.  I craned my neck to find the sushi bar, noted that it was empty except for one person, and headed there.  I sat down and started reading the book I was carrying.Some time passed, perhaps 8-10 minutes, and no server had approached.  I could see clearly now that the line at the door was not a line to be seated as much as it was a line to order!  Even, so, I had not been to a sushi restaurant where the bar was NOT first-come first-served.  So I sat for a minute or two more.A server approached me and asked if she could help me.  Almost immediately I realized my mistake and asked about it.  Did I break the process?  This server, J., said with a warm smile that I had, but apologized to me and offered to bring menus.  There are two menus, sushi and non.  The non menu had dishes you could order 3 ways, Bento box, over noodles and I think with rice, not sure about the third.  It also had soups you could order with Udon noodle base.  I insisted that I only wanted the Spicy Beef Soup and nothing else, but J. talked me into a sushi roll.  I ordered a simple roll that was a California roll with tuna on top.  The chef in front of me, B., prepared it and handed it to me.  We did not speak aside from my ""thank you.""The soup was in a beef broth, as one might expect for a soup with sliced beef in it.  The broth was the best part.  The noodles were plentiful and took on the broth flavor fine.  The beef was seasoned well, but got tough pretty quickly as it continued to cook in the broth.  Not too tough to eat, just a little work for the cheek muscles.  There were a few veggies in the soup as well.J. continued to bring me soda refills, even though the dispenser was right behind me.  As I worked on the soup, a big spoon appeared as well as an extra napkin.  The sushi roll was under $7.00, large and very very fresh.  I could smell the cucumber in the roll, even with the tuna on top.  It required a dip in the proximity of my ginger and soy dish for a little saltiness to bring out the flavor.  This is in contrast to most sushi restaurants in Jax where I prefer to drown the thing.  It was a very good texture in the mouth for what it contained: crunch soft, crunch.About halfway through the sushi, B. handed me a plate with another sushi roll.  I was sure he was joking, trying to break the ice with the guy that's been sitting in front of him for more than 30 minutes.  He wasn't joking.  He had prepared another roll that had eel on top of a CA. roll, for me.  For a flash moment I thought he might be pushing food on me to raise my tab.  But that soon passed as he made it clear it was on him.  (I hope he doesn't get in trouble for doing so, and I hope that using his initial and not his name obscures his identity enough. I want to give him credit, not grief.)As I looked at it, and at the same moment J. returned to check on me, I recalled how polarizing eel is.  Some people love it, many won't touch it.  My entire family won't touch it.  So I said to B. ""How did you know I would even eat eel?  I like it, but we haven't spoken 3 words until you handed it to me.""  He said that he didn't, he just took a chance.  Pretty confident.I asked J. to bring me a togo container for my soup.  She insisted on taking it and doing it herself.  ""It makes a big mess, let me take care of it.""  I finished the sushi.  Both rolls.  I was stuffed.  Happy stuffed.The atmosphere was simple, with an open ceiling and few decorations.  The ordering actually works exactly like Mama Fu's, counter order then sit with a number.  Which is not to say that it's LIKE Mama Fu's.  I really appreciate how I misread the entire situation at first and J. absolutely refused to allow it to be an awkward situation.  It was clearly my mistake.  Otherwise, I really liked the variety on the menu and the soup I had was good.  If they can stay busy and keep the fish fresh, they will do well.  Crazy Sushi is nearby and has set a high bar for sushi quality around Tinseltown, but I recommend Bento Cafe.I have to add one final note.  There was nothing about my outward appearance that would suggest I needed to be treated like royalty.  I looked like I had just stopped walking behind my lawnmower and decided to hit the mall.  I know that reviews of restaurants where the reviewer received a freebie and hard to take at face value.  But I would to thank B. and J. for treating me so well."
1/4/2016,3,"Just another typical Asian restaurant. Sushi is expensive and the food seemed to be pretty mediocre. I heard good things about the place until I showed up and saw for myself. Don't get me wrong, its good. If you're looking for basic level Asian cuisine, this is your place."
2/27/2013,3,"Pretty Good. My daughter's favorite place to eat. She always gets the Create a Don. Sashimi chunks of salmon and slices of udon on a sticky rice with some yummy spicy mayo and some kind of seaweed looking salad garnish. I think some shredded beet too. I've had it, but just the salmon, and it is indeed tasty. Would have given it 4 stars if staff were a bit friendlier, and if it was always good. Once, the entire dish was warm, which tasted a bit weird."
3/23/2013,5,"As a fan of Thai and sushi, I discovered this restaurant as a recommendation by my boss and was not disappointed. Since then, I have been here as least 4 times and brought friends and family with me and they have enjoyed the food as well.The bowls are big and hold a lot of food. I tried the Pad Thai and absolutely love it! One of the best in the area! The sushi bento boxes are an awesome deal and you get tons of sushi! I try a new roll everytime and absolutely love the freshness and quality of the sushi. Lastly, I've become addicted to the Green Boba Tea with the pearls. Chewy balls of fun with every sip! My only gripe is that it is not close to me but then if it were, I would be broke! :) Highly recommended!!"
2/4/2011,4,"I LOVE the concept of this place. I wish I had a place just like this where I live, but then I'd have to eat there all the time. My husband and I both got the Sushi Combo Box for lunch, which is another great concept, a whole California Roll and 2 half rolls of our choice. I got the Mt Fuji roll and the Mexican roll, both wonderful and my husband got the Yoshi Roll and the Special Mexican Roll, again wonderful. I will have to come back and try the Bento boxes and the noodles."
4/12/2010,2,"Garbage.I have never been moved to review a restaurant before but am now inspired. ""Asian Fusion"" is a correct category as this place is fusion, i.e. bastardization of Japanese food and Fail.No sir, you need not learn anything of Japanese food or culture in opening a Japanese styled restaurant. Katsudon? Not here. The maguro was oversized and bland. The amaebi served on a bed of beet shavings. The sushi chefs... Latin gentlemen with Japanese styled goatees.The wait staff was super friendly. Very cute young ladies.But a word of advice: use plenty of soy sauce. Thank God the Kirin was bottled... At least they can't screw that up."
11/11/2014,5,"Whenever the answer to ""What are you in the mood for?"" is ""noodles"", I immediately start thinking of reasons to be in the vicinity of Bento.  I used to live very nearby and would stop in whenever I was shopping at the Town Center or for any flimsy reason, but now that I'm on the other side of town I feel like I have to have another reason to be in the area so that I can eat my noodles!But when I do invent a reason to go to REI or that specific Target or whatever, I know that Bento has my back for a delicious lunch or dinner, but never at actual lunch or dinner time because I would never eat.  This place is packed at meal times, and for good reason.  Everything I've tried on the menu, I have enjoyed, and the rice plates and noodle bowls are an amazing value for the money.  (The sushi is less so, but there are so many other places for sushi nearby that it seems silly to come here for that!)  My go-to dishes are the pad thai or the pad ki mao (aka drunken noodles), always at ""level 2 spicy"" for that extra kick in the mouth.  My husband will eat almost anything on the menu, but now that we're there less often he sticks with the spicy cream, from which I always snag a tasty tempura meat.  If you're looking for authentic Thai or Korean or Japanese food, this is probably not the place to go, but if you like the ""Pan-Asian"" style you'll be happy here!Bento is also wonderful for its friendly wait staff and surprisingly quick service (not so much so when the place is full, but still pretty fast!).  They are even willing to grab you a to-go box or extra chopsticks when you forget that those items are sitting out waiting for you to go get them yourself.  If they ever open up a store near my new place, I will be in noodle heaven."
6/28/2015,3,"It was okay food. I had the udon noodle soup, I was surprised I didn't get sick. My sister had the XOXO sushi and she really liked it. It was packed and the line was out the door but I'm not sure what's the hype."
2/28/2011,3,"The sushi is great and they let you have dogs in their outdoor seating. I still only give them three stars because I think they are overpriced. I didn't order the edamame because of my previous experience. The puppy and I enjoyed some delish sushi last night in the cool, February air. Thanks, Bento!(No, I did not give my dog sushi. She's too picky for that, anyway!)"
4/27/2011,4,"Bento is really great.  It's the only pan-Asian place worth anything on the south side of town.  (can I just wag my finger at the guy who gave Bento one star because *he* doesn't like it and his friends always want to go there?  That's just douchey...if you don't like it, rate it objectively, and don't take off points because you're mad at your friends.)  Their service is really great, and they always do a good job of moving the lunch rush crowd through, even considering that there is a high concentration of folks who have irritating habits that tend to slow down the line.  Their katsu pork is delicious, and their sushi is good as well.  I also like their pad Thai, and the boba tea is delicious.My only gripes?1.  The dining room is NOISY!  They need to hang some sound-absorbing art or lay some carpet.2.  There is not enough outdoor seating.3.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider putting a traditional Japanese Ramen dish on the menu!!!!!"
7/3/2010,4,"So, I am quite a lover of Asian cuisine and pride myself on taking on new gastronomic experiences. I heard about Bento (blue) Cafe from a coworker of mine and decided it's been too long if i have to hear about a new place from a coworker! (Usually I'm the one finding new places!)   So I will admit there are two pics, they are of sushi and of a Bento box I chose for dinner one weekday with my spouse. I like having options (which they have aplenty) since I'm not a seafood eater. I tried Mongolian chicken without onions ,it came with ginger salad, steamed rice with sesame seeds, lo mien noodles and fruit garnish. The portions for the price are QUITE on the small side, but flavorful. I also had a Malibu milk/bubble tea with pearls which was VERY tasty and will from now on ask for no pearls. I forget I don't like the tapioca bubbles. The hubs had the Red Dragon roll (VERY VERY tasty he says) Cali roll, and some Nigiri (salmon and mackerel) which he says were Very good.   The atmosphere was laid back, pan Asian fusion is how I'd describe it and small. The walking wasn't bad at all considering it IS at the Town Center.   I can definitely say as long as we can still find parking (i suppose that's hit or miss ) we will Definitely be coming back! Besides , when you go on Monday you get two bucks off with your receipt next door at Mochi- try the Taro with sweetened condensed milk BTW!"
2/26/2013,4,Ok so the four is not for food quality but menu quantity.  I love being able to get all my favorite dishes and drinks in one place.  It makes for very interesting combos and a fun night out.  Also the staff is always nice and helpful.The prices are a little high for the quantity and quality but still tasty so I would give the food a 3.I will go back but not as a regular.  Maybe once every other month.
2/1/2015,4,The salmon salad is amazing!  Their curry tastes like a cheap sauce from a can.  I strictly stick with the salad.  Great prices!
6/27/2011,4,Sandcastle roll- which is not on the menu is fantastic. Really great sushi and even better noodle and rice bowls.
10/7/2010,2,"Decor is ok. You order at the counter and find an open seat to wait for the food. The food comes out real quick. However, the food is not good. If people are raving about this restaurant, they need to venture over to a decent place pronto. Take a visit to SF or NYC. Get out a bit more.The food is greasy and just too oily. The flavor is very sub-par. They give you a good sized portion, but quantity does not make up for a lack off quality.The only thing I liked about this place was they served nigori sake (sho chiku bai brand)."
6/28/2013,1,Lame. Totally horrible. It's an insult to Asian cuisine. The stuck up staff is not much help.Go to Pei Wei which is better by leaps and bounds.This place only has customers because of its location.RUN AWAY!!!!
6/28/2015,4,Very enjoyable. Delicious. Large menu. You order at the counter and then they bring the food to the table.
2/2/2015,2,"The concept is great - fast casual sushi and a large selection of Asian dishes. The service was very friendly and fast and the atmosphere is beautiful and fun. However, the food was really mediocre at best and way way overpriced. Unfortunate and really disappointing experience."
8/31/2011,4,"Just tried this place for lunch with a coworker and was pleasantly surprised. We had to wait in a line for almost 20 minutes, which I was not a fan of during the lunch hour, but they made up for it with the food. We both had sushi and I had very low expectations. I have yet to find a sushi place in Jacksonville that matches the quality of almost any sushi restaurant in San Francisco or Seattle, but I thought it was pretty good. It didn't have me doing cartwheels, but I'll definitely go back. The ambiance is actually what sold me in the end. It's sleek and modern, and made me feel like I wasn't in Jacksonville for a moment. Parking and traffic in general is probably always going to be a pain at this place. It's the Town Center, so deal with it. Oh, and there's a Yobe next door, which I don't get (didn't we already do the whole frozen yogurt fad in the 90s?) but a lot of people seem to like."
6/12/2015,4,"I love THIS bento- Bento blue. I prefer this over Red any day. Their sushi is fresh and beautiful, the service is great. It would be a five start eating but they need some renovations! Their AC was leaking to the point of dropping on the floor! Also- the booths are in bad shape. I will update my review if these improvements are made. I will still go for their yummy Asian dishes! Yum!"
11/13/2015,4,"Another one of my favorite lunch places - the sushi is above average, the soups (whether the noodle soups or appetizer soups) are lukewarm (which I took a star off for alongwith a so-so drunken noodles I had there), but the spicy salmon don, spicy cream chicken (picture deep-fried chicken pieces in a suprisingly delicious lightly spiced cream sauce) were a big hit with the family.You get a choice of whether you want your meal in a bento (a little bit of everything - noodles, rice, salad, green beans, etc), with noodles, or on rice.  Lots of options and a fun place to hit up for lunch."
7/30/2011,3,"Sub-par sushi.. Not bad but not great. I won't go out of my way to eat there; but if I am in town center and feel like eating sushi, bento is good enough.The ""boxes"" are not very good but the ""bowls"" are decent (same quality as panda express)."
9/17/2010,4,"I love Bento Cafe, it is a very chic modern fast food asian restaurant.  Great Decor, every time I've been there has been lots of people on staff, always busy, sometimes you need to wait a few minutes to snag a table.I usually get the udon noodle bowl.  The portion is HUGE, and I typically take half of it home.  I love that there are bottles of sriracha easily accessible to kick the noodles up to another level. Great bang for your buck here.  save some room for mochi next door!"
3/5/2011,3,"This place was okay... Wife got Chicken Katsu and myself Beef Pad Thai.  The Katsu's breading fell off... katsu doesn't do that unless did wrong... part of my pad Thai was cold.  Got bento box, came with string beans, rice, salad w/ ginger sauce.  the dressing was VERY skimpy on the salad, but to their credit, i don't care for string beans, but I ate all of them gladly, those were crisp and seasoned nicely.  It was a tad overpriced for what you got.  Very crowded place as well... Mochi's next door was alot more fun if seeking a snack.Oh yeah, forgot a key thing... Wife was excited for Katsu sauce... we got plain BBQ... yuck."
9/24/2015,2,"The menu is amazing and it looks like it would be great but the food always makes me sick! Not to mention, I ALWAYS see their staff out back smoking and hanging out around the trash and they look filthy! No wonder I always get sick!"
7/22/2017,1,"The worst meal i ever had today. I was here a lot of time before. Today i got ramen, which was so plain, tasteless. The taro milk tea and original milk tea were super nasty sweet that we had to put half glass of water and ice in so we can drink it. Sushi is fine not much to complain. There were no wonder why there were not a lot of customers here  on a beautiful saturday lunch time, which i used to wait a long line to get order. Very disappointed. I dont think i could come back here."
5/20/2015,1,"Extremely dirty restaurant. We even had to wave flies away from our lunch the whole time. Floors, tables, chairs and silverware all have smudges, dirt, drips and are sticky. Will not be back unless I have a blindfold. :/ needs new management!!!"
7/10/2015,3,"The environment is nice.  Can get too crowded during peak hours which at times affects operational capacity more than most places. The sushi there is very good, however.  Best to go when first opened, earlier in the evening or before closing hours."
1/15/2014,4,"One of the Best cafe shop in the city.I really love this place , i have visited here for 2 to 3 times and and always had a great coffee. Fantastic coffee , very friendly environment and also fast services. I would recommend it to everyone."
2/28/2014,4,"I can't believe this is my first time coming here since I've been yelping. It has definitely been a while since I've been here. This visit was no different from any other for me though. The Sushi is always fresh and delicious, not to mention very beautifully presented. Their other food items are always very delicious also. There is only one thing I really don't care for on the Menu (I've tried everything here) which is the Korean chicken. I find it lacks flavor. Not caring for one dish out of the many they offer is pretty damn good, in my opinion anyway. Another small gripe is seating, It can be a pain to find one on very busy nights. The employees are usually very friendly. They always have an awesome attitude and I usually get three or four ""Have a good night"" on my way out from them. Tonight was the first night that I've seen the line well out the front door! But I can totally understand why though. This place rocks. Oh, and I noticed on my visit here tonight that they have now linked Mochi and Bento Cafe together with a doorway within the restaurant."
12/14/2014,1,Worst boba tea I have ever taste.  I recently order two taro boba milk tea.  Just from the look of it that it was going to be awful.  The first slip was full of syrup and had no taro flavor.  The boba it self was way undercook and was super hard.  Either they didn't cook it or it was really old.  This place has the lowest quality of sushi I have ever seen but you pay for what you get there.  Qcup boba is way better.  Sushi at town-center over is aweful.
6/17/2012,4,"A word to the wise: get here at 11:30 or 12:45...otherwise, pick somewhere else for lunch (especially if you're on a time crunch during the week). The food is consistently good, which is why there's always a line out the door during peak hours. Another pointer: they will NOT take any more orders if the entire restaurant is seated so do everyone else a favor; don't be a jerk and ""save seats""..you won't get your food any faster, mmkay? I have this problem...I don't like change...therefore I can comment solely on the spicy tuna don, because that's all I've ever gotten here. Oh, and the spring rolls. Those are good too. The general tso's chicken looks and smells good, and I've heard rave reviews about their sushi."
5/10/2015,5,One of my favorite sushi places. I've tried several things from the sushi and regular menu and everything has been delicious.
9/3/2012,4,"A friend of mine who lives in Jacksonville now suggested this place to meet up for lunch. The place was PACKED, especially for such a rainy day. Tables and chairs were strategically packed together to use up the space as efficiently as possible. Be kind and don't linger too long if you see that the place is full, so that other patrons may order and eat, too.Peruse the menu as you stand in line and order when you get to the register. You pick the meats/style you want and MOST items can be made into your choice of a bento box, noodle bowl, or rice dish (some cannot, and will specify so next to the style). Everything is pretty Americanized, but still quite delectable. They're very quick and prices are fair for the portion you receive. They are also very accommodating to customizing your order."
11/21/2013,5,"Spicy creamy chicken noodle bowl is so yummy! The pad Thai chicken is also so great! If you have a big appetite for yummy food, come here!"
9/23/2017,3,Good sushi but the wait is so long! I never understand why only one register is open when there could be 30 people in line waiting. I think if they had two registers going the experience would be more pleasant.
3/9/2010,3,"Was very excited an Asian Fusion place opened up near the St. John's Towne Center. Hubby seems to live at Golf Galaxy and I will go along for the ride, provided we can stop and have Happy Hour Sushi in Bento's. Bento's has a Volcano Roll that is AWESOME! OK, ok, it is not typical sushi, but Asian Fusion. This is a huge futomaki with a warm crab meat mixed with spicy sauce sitting on the top. Order 2 of these and get a third roll free -- as their happy hour is 3 rolls for the price of 2. We also ordered 2 soups and hot green tea and got out of there with about $30 to include tip. On Monday night, you can take your receipt next door to MOCHI for a dollar off of the price of soft serve frozen yogurt with all of the fixins. Bento's has adequate seating with a wait staff that brings your order to the table. There are signs posted that say, ""do not sit before ordering"" so therefore, one must order food before taking up table space.  After coming here several times, the only reason we're giving it 3 stars out of 5 is the way the restaurant is set up:  Order first from a HUGE menu -- oh, that is, from TWO Menu's. Then pay, then sit. We've watched the efficiency of the restaurant come to a stand still as customers line up outside waiting to order from this huge menu. It would be so much better if the wait staff seated you, then came to take your order, like other restaurants, only because of the large line at the entrance and the confused looks on first time attendees.  After all, the wait staff brings your items to your table anyhow. And we always leave a tip. So we think a full service wait staff set up would be more efficient than how it is set up now.  I do recommend trying the other items on the menu as we've been back 4-5 times in the last 2 months. Food is yummy and affordable! This place also serves Boba Tea!  If you are coming in at dinner time, especially on Fri or Sat, don't expect to be seated right away as this place stays busy at dinner time."
12/27/2011,4,"This place is delicious! Great for families and kids too. The bento box is a great choice if you are having a hard time deciding, it's like a sampler plate. The noodle bowls are also good and the boba tea too! My favorite is the orange boba tea!"
4/6/2010,3,"Didn't expect to find a boba/bubble tea place in Jacksonville, but I did a local search online and found the Bento Cafe. The boba was decent. Had the thai tea one. Will definitely be back to try one of the bento boxes on my next trip to Jacksonville."
2/13/2015,4,"I tend to not favor chain restaurants, but Bento is an exception to the rule.  Also, many Asian fusion joints have strengths, like great sushi or hibachi while everything else might be mediocre, but Bento has multiple strengths and offers fairly authentic cuisine from various cultures.  I usually have a sushi combination that comes with a ginger seaweed salad which is surprisingly delicious.  Their boba milk tea is good, but a little too sweet compared to other venues.  Bento tends to get packed, so it's best for those who don't mind people watching.  This location seems to be generally clean, is aesthetically pleasing, and I've never had service that wasn't fast and friendly."
2/12/2010,3,"I like that it has so many varieties in regards to the food and drinks but it's just Ok.  Please don't put Aroma Corner out of business!! I would die without my Jasmine milk tea with tea jelly! Anyways, hubby usually gets a noodle bowl and I get a bento box, 1 sushi roll and two boba drinks, which will typically runs over $30, which I feel is a bit much. Taste: I've had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and I don't know if that's how its suppose to taste because I'm pretty sure my mom doesn't make it like that.  The turnaround time on food is pretty quick so maybe flavor is sacrificed a bit.  The sushi rolls we've had so far has been pretty good.  Boba drinks are pretty good as well. Portion: Reasonable and what I expected. Service: Good - The girls bring the food to your table, Price: $$ - $$$ - Depends on how much you get - we like to eat =DDecore/Ambiance: Modern-ish, sushi bar, can get hard to find a table when they're busy."
7/16/2010,4,"Very good and very inexpensive for what you get.Try the 'create-a-don' donburi bowl, for under $10 you'll get quite a bit of sashimi with rice and some associates.  Fish is fresh, service is okay but not terrible, and the frozen yogurt next door also owned by the same folks is always top notch."
9/22/2011,2,Disappointed in the food here...wasn't that good. I've had their katsu bento and sushi...wasn't that good.
5/1/2015,4,"4 Stars!!Although my wife & I like Mama Fu's better, Bento's is a very good alternative!!  The ambiance is nice here, and the food is prepared quick and fresh!!  All their dishes have been very good so far - a real nice treat here is their ""Bento Box"" option - which is a great deal for the money - you just need to be sure you're hungry!!I enjoy coming here whenever I'm in the area and want good food at a good price!!"
5/24/2014,1,"This place is seriously a sad excuse for ""Pan-Asian and Sushi"". Entrees are greasy, lacking flavor and presentation. The sushi is underwhelming.  I'm guessing since the location is in a busy part of the town center, it brings in a lot of traffic. However, it is not difficult to find some authentic and well made Asian food or sushi around here. Better luck trying some other Japanese restaurants around Jacksonville."
9/21/2010,3,"teriyaki chicken was ok.  i've had better.sushi was good.i liked the decor on the inside, a bit loud so it seemed like more fast food ish like."
7/11/2014,2,Don't use the online ordering system!! My total was $30 online but when I showed up they rang me out at $42.  All they could tell me was that the error was a glitch and that they were sorry.  They made no attempt to throw anything in or offer credit back on my card.  Thanks for the deceiving prices and bad customer service!!
4/11/2015,5,"Great place for a Bento fix. They have the usual selections,  I am partial to the Teriyaki."
10/23/2011,4,"Three words: Awesome Coke Machine. They have installed one of those Awesome soda machines that has all the flavors of soda you can imagine. Vanilla Coke Zero, Cherry Coke Zero, Any fruit flavor Fanta: you name it. I love those machines. Before I was on the fence here because the Pad-Thai was ok but since the Coke Machine made its presence I am sold. I like the Korean BBQ on noodles, and they have plenty of options for any Asian food lover. The reason for the 4 stars and not five is I have no idea what has happened to the Boba drinks. I used to always get the chocolate slush with boba beads but the beads now have a strong tea-taste that ruins it. I think they have been soaking them in tea, very disappointing. Still a great eatery I would recommend to anyone, especially with the new soda machine."
10/1/2014,4,"Lunch at the Bento Cafe was very good. Lots of choices. A little confusing at first. I had rice bowl. Veggies were fresh, not frozen. Served hot which is good for me. Nice flavor and portion size was not skimpy. My husband had sushi. Nice sized portion. Good flavors. The ambiance is kind of sterile. They are making something in blenders. Very noisy."
12/29/2014,4,"I'm so glad I decided to check this place out for dinner while at the town center.  Luckily when I arrived they were still doing sushi happy hour, buy 2 rolls get 1 free.  All 3 rolls were delicious,  better than a lot of other places I've tried.  The only downside was paying for the extra sauces (shrimp sauce, spicy mayo etc)  that usually come complimentary at other sushi restaurants. I will definitely be back to try the noodle dishes."
5/16/2017,5,"Bento has the best boba tea in town. I've been here too many times to count and my food has always been good. I love the green beans that come with the bento boxes, but I really come for the tea! Green tea with pearls and mango... do it!!"
12/23/2014,5,"Friendly, patient staff and great food. I had the Mongolian noodle bowl and in my opinion, the Mongolian beef was better than p.f. Changs or pei Wei. And the noodles are amazing. I also had the boba tea and that was also great. If you've never tried boba tea Id recommend it at bento cafe."
2/18/2017,1,"Went on a Thursday night. Pretty full but we found a table. Nice atmosphere for this type of place. We both ordered the same roll, the dynamite. My mate got his right away, it took another 15 minutes for mine to arrive. It was described as ""DYNAMITE tuna, salmon, krab*, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, scallions, masago, spicy mayoIt"". After eating a few slices and wondering where the ingredients were, I decided to open one. There was nothing inside except rice and some krab. Maybe a little cream cheese, maybe a tiny bit of avacado. I put up with ""krab"" these days as no one even here in Florida knows that it is fake. But you did not even put in any of the other ingredients you claimed to be in there. $9 for rice wrapped in seaweed with some sauce?? Will never return."
2/13/2015,5,Awesome place. Atmosphere was very modern and sleek. Was greeted by the server as I walked in to order. Service is fast but went during a lunch rush which was super busy wait for food was slow but understandable. I got the Spicy Cream Chicken it is like Sweet n Sour Chicken but on crack! I can't get enough of it. I recommend getting the Spicy Cream Chicken if you only go there once in your life!!
6/17/2014,4,good fast food.  I have had the sushi and the bento boxes and everything is well detailed.
10/23/2013,5,Tuna Salmon Don Sashimi Bowl is the best!!! As well as a strawberry red tea with Boba pearls :)
6/15/2014,5,"Bento is my absolute favorite go-to for sushi and noodle dishes in Jacksonville. The sushi is always fresh and they put plenty of fish in the rolls. The spicy mayo is delicious. Their rolls are innovative and expertly composed. The hot food is also very well made, and the Bento boxes are a great deal. The udon soup is perfect for when you are feeling a bit under the weather. Although they always have a line, the line moves quickly and I've never had a problem finding a seat."
7/30/2014,3,"Overall this place strikes me as slightly above mediocre - I was pleased by the amount of vegetarian dishes available. Hubby and I came for lunch and were pleasantly surprised the line moved quickly. The place is clean and has a bit of an urban vibe.Now onto the food - I ordered the veggie spring rolls and thai yellow curry veggie bowl with brown rice and tofu. The curry tasted ok (seemed a bit on the flavorless mild side) and the tofu texture was actually pretty good. Brown rice was nicely cooked and the veggies were fresh and crunchy. The bowl was huge - I had enough leftovers to take care of dinner. The spring rolls were probably my favorite part of my meal - hot and crispy accompanied by a nice sweet and sour sauce. Hubby had the Cajun chicken bento box which came with noodles, ginger salad, green beans and white rice. He liked the Cajun chicken and really like the ginger sauce from the salad with his green beans (go figure).  The wait service was passable - u usually had to flag someone to get their attention but everyone was pleasant. Overall this place isn't my first  or last choice for lunch, but I would like to return and taste the sushi. Not a bad selection for quick Asian cuisine."
8/14/2016,2,"This place sucks but the location of this place is what draws people from keeping this place open. When you step in the door you fall in line with roughly 10-15 people ahead of you with only 1 cashier taking orders. After your done with the cashier good luck finding a table since its packed with millenials and teenyboppers hanging around eating with chopsticks actin that this place is authentic and when I got seated, the table keeps wobbling because it's not aligned right. Their milk teas are horrible! Too much syrup or sweetener and the boba pearl is hard to chew and hardly any ice so the drink is not even cold. Their so-called korean bulgogi disappointed me also. I ordered a platter and instead gave me a bowl with the beef that the meat is hard to chew with barely no flavor just spice. Like I said they're lucky they have a good location especially here in Jax where the competition of quality of Asian Restaurants are scarce"
3/1/2015,5,Food is great I love bento box red curryNice ambience and staff is good.Very good place for dinner
4/3/2014,3,"Slightly out of my ideal price range for the food I'm getting, Bento Cafe does delight me with very clean and spacious interior and the staff's ability to (without fail) have a live NBA game on the TV. Because this is an Asian restaurant, in essence, I can't give it more than a three-star rating because of its portion size. The dishes are made for people who weigh less than 165 pounds or people who weigh more than 165 but recently had lap-band surgery. I am a grown man. I can't cheerlead for a place that leaves me hungry 45 minutes after I leave there - especially after I spent $55 there. Despite being tucked in bustling and busy St. Johns Town Center, Bento will continue to pull in business because, in Jacksonville, the trendy and hip thing to do is say you've tried different cuisines. For some reason, a local thinks he or she comes off as more worldly if they've eaten Asian fusion food or something other than a crab boil. I enjoy the intimacy of the place and customizable ""boxes,"" but that's where my admiration ends with Bento."
10/6/2014,5,"Very tasty. I had the korean giogeu (not sure on pronunciation) beef and it was as divine. Fast, fresh, very flavorful and at a fair price."
10/30/2016,3,"Decent sushi. If you're the kind of person that calls ahead or orders online, be aware they frequently forget to put the order in or to check online orders. This has happened to me four times in the last couple months. You'll show up and they've never heard of your order"
12/22/2013,5,This is probably my favorite place in Jacksonville. I have tasted a lot of the items on the menu and they are all delicious. The teas are very good as well. The service is always good.
8/15/2014,5,"I had a great meal here. Its neat that you can order a variety of different things at this restaurant. The food was good and the portions are big, the decor was trendy and cool, and the service was fast and friendly. I will definitely come back and try some other menu items!"
4/16/2010,4,"I love Bento.This is my go-to Asian lunch place.  I always order the bulgogi.  It is great and spicy.  To me, everything tastes fresh.  I am not a sushi lover, so I can not judge their sushi, but it does look fresh and well made.  I did not give it 5 stars though because some items on the menue are ""hidden"" nightmares.  Their food is inconsistant because it is either amazing or awful.  ....But the good thing is that about 95% of the menue is awesome.Great asain without the Jacksonville staple ""buffet""."
7/16/2010,1,"I was very dissatisfied with Bento. Even though I am not a vegetarian, I love tofu and I love spicy, so I thought the soy chili would be a good choice. Since we were at Bento Cafe, I wanted to try the Bento Box. Uhhghh, I wish I had went to Panda Express up the street. The tofu they used was terribly soft and the dish, although stated to be ""very spicy"" was insipid. I could not stand the consistency of the tofu, so I sent it back for chicken, which was not much of an upgrade.  The rest of the bento box was a wreck too. The lo-mein noodles were dry, the vegetables were greasy, and the rice was mediocre.I don't think I will be giving Benro Cafe a second chance."
4/21/2013,4,"I love the fact that Bento Cafe has ramen. It's not the same ramen as in NYC and other metropolitan cities, but it's sufficient enough! I was hesitant at first to try out the place only because I figured it was just another fast food Asian fusion restaurant serving the same type of meal. Well I was wrong. I have recently became a fan, and I try to visit it whenever I can. There is just so much options to choose from, and it's seems like it's never ending. Everything I have tried has been great with the exception of the noodles that they serve with the bento box. It was bland. So far my favorite items from Bento cafe is their Tofu Red Curry in rice bowl, Beef Bulgogi in a Bento Box, and their spicy seafood noodle soup. I love how you can choose between the rice plate/bowl, bento box, or noodle (depending on the type of food you have chosen). The bento box actually comes with white rice, ginger salad, string beans, and noodles. Coming to Bento also doesn't break the bank as you get a decent sized portion and nothing is more than $9 per meal. If you are on a budget and craving for some decent asian meal, I recommend coming to Bento Cafe. It's well worth the visit!"
12/19/2015,2,"Being a Bento lover, I go often, maybe every week or two. Today for lunch I got the bento fried rice bowl with chicken, the dynamite #2 and the special Mexican roll. The total ended up being more than $25. I eat the dynamite #2 every time I go in and it is always delicious, it was not as crunchy as usual but still had a good taste. Though, today my rice looked almost white and barely cooked. I understand that everyone tries to have great ticket times but serving food that isn't cooked properly is a big no no. When I informed one of the employees that worked there, they grabbed my bowl of rice (the one I had already had a couple of bites of) and took it back over the sell window and gave it to the kitchen. The kitchen looked at it and then handed it to a different girl who came back to ask what was wrong with the rice. That same bowl of rice was then taken back to the kitchen again for them to try and solve the issue. I was given the same rice again and it tasted as if they had just mixed the rice up with more soy sauce. It was not cooked more or fresh or hot. Honestly, this experience has ruined my love for Bento."
11/1/2013,4,"Huge menu.  I've visited twice and I have enjoyed the sushi, bento boxes and noodle soups.  Both offering more than a one meal portion size.  The sushi is not my favorite in the area, mostly imitation fish and cream cheese based and not very fresh tasting."
7/17/2016,1,"Has a no seat-saving rule, which is not posted anywhere. My wife, 2 month old, and I were going to meet a friend for lunch here and sat down before ordering, only to be rudely told we all had to get up and go through the line before sitting down. Fine, whatever. What made this more of a problem was that at a table toward the front, a lady was very obviously saving the table while the rest of her party ordered. No number or drinks or anything there with her. If you are going to have a rule like that, post it and apply it equally. And definitely be more polite when enforcing it. Will not be back."
11/25/2013,5,Great food for the small place.  My wife and I eat there quite frequently and the food is always top notch.  The service is as good as you can get for the type it offers.
7/2/2011,2,"I really tried to like Bento, but I just can't get into it.  Half of my brother's little Filipina girlfriends work there and it's almost always crowded with obnoxious teenagers and the food is, like, Asian Food for White People, and their salad is a combo of spring mix and iceberg lettuce which is just strange.  *inhales*  Their bulgogi has the consistency and taste of bland beef rendang (gritty and pasty).  The pork katsu tasted oddly sweet and vegetal.  They don't serve enough rice with their bento boxes, the lo mein is greasy, and the boba tea is powdery.  The names of their sushi rolls are amusing, but have little to do with the sushi itself.  For example, two Filipinos such as me and my dining partner are bound to order a kawaii roll called ""The Thrillla in Manila"" which didn't have anything reminiscent of either the Philippines or Muhammad Ali.  And what the f*ck is a kawaii roll?  Rolling it in rice paper and loading it up with lettuce is supposed to make it cute or something?  I would also call Bento out on the misleading descriptions contained within their menu, but the dishes aren't really authentic, so I'll leave that alone.  But, for future reference, describing pancit palabok as ""rice noodles with tasty gravy"" is like describing haggis as ""kind of like meatloaf.""  Real pancit palabok would best be described as ""This is gonna be the fishiest g-damn thing you've ever eaten.  Would like you like hardboiled eggs, chicharron, or both with that?""  On the other hand, you get a lot of relatively palatable food for a reasonable price.  And their Japanese curry reminded me so much of those little squares of Golden Curry my mom used to cook with when we lived in Japan.  I won't dock them any points for the fact that I never really liked Golden Curry, but I can't in good consciousness give them more than 2 stars.And here's a funny story of how rude people can be (which has nothing to do with Bento and did not sway my experience with them, I swear) - my dining companion and I made the mistake of sitting at a table right next to the ordering line.  If you've been to Bento, you know that this first line of tables and the ordering line are separated only slightly by a little half-wall.  An Asian family of 5 was in line and one of the family members came into the table area to reserve a space for the rest of the family.  The family member (let's call her ""Auntie"") then walked up to my immediate right and began a loud conversation with a younger family member (let's call her ""Hello Kitty"") immediately to my left on the other side of the half-wall.  Keep in mind that, not only was the half-wall in between them, but so was I and my little two top - my dining companion had gone to the restroom at this point.  Auntie only spoke their indigenous language (I'm guessing it was Vietnamese?) and, for those of you familiar with most South Asian languages, they are spoken very loudly.  Hello Kitty was speaking just as loudly in English.  So they tossed a few sentences back and forth with each other and then Hello Kitty passed Auntie a menu... over my table... about 5 inches from my face.  Like I wasn't even there."
7/7/2014,4,"Great sushi and bento boxes, love the Mongolian beef box. Reasonably priced for the portions, never leave hungry.  Also try a bubble tea!"
11/23/2014,4,"Great experience. Prices are very reasonable, and the portions are very fair.   Place does get super buys, so service at times can be a bit slow, however understandable when there is a line literally out the door.  Highly recommend."
3/9/2010,4,i think i maaayy be addicted to bento & theres plenty of reasons why. 1. lychee boba aka bubble tea. 2. spicy tuna salad with extra avocado & ginger dressing.3. they have lychee flavored sake. 4. they carry strawberry ramune soda. i can understand WHY this place has horrible reviews though. there are some things on the menu that just ARENT delicious such as the 'spicy cream.' vommmz! steer clear of that one. szechuan chicken is pretty good if you get it as a bento box. you just really have to be careful about what you order or else if can be a baaad trip.
11/16/2009,3,"Standard fare in bento dining.  Also has a fine selection of pan asian cusine that I was impresed with, ranging from Thai dishes to Pho selections.  The sushi menu was extensive and a great deal for the sushi box @ $8.95, which comes with two sushi rolls and a california roll.  The sushi was at the right size, but the fish did not have the overall freshness factor that wowed me in other restaurants.  Great interior decor and lighting.  Great to dine with couples and groups on weekend."
3/14/2014,3,Food is good. Sushi is okay you are better off going somewhere else. Avoid this place during peak hours because it is crowded. Other than that food is hot and good.
9/14/2012,4,"The food in general is good! I don't know if their menu is close to being absolutely authentic, but it's still tasty and worth trying."
3/21/2016,1,I went to this restaurant today and ordered a rice bowl.  All I got was a bowl of rice with a couple of chunks of pineapple.  All the vegetables that were supposed to be in it were not there.  I finally got the attention of one of the waitresses and asked her about it.  She said that they had run out of the vegetables (it was 12:51pm) and hadn't they told me.  I was with my daughter and granddaughter and their entrees had plenty of vegetables.  She offered to bring me something else but my lunch mates were already done.  She knew this as she was picking up the plates while we were having this discussion.  I hardly think that was a suitable remedy.  I won't be back.
12/21/2010,4,"Bento is everything you're looking for in a quick and affordable break from shopping at the Town Center. To be quite honest, I go to the Town Center to eat here more than I go to shop. Some of my favorite SUSHI rolls are: High Roller, Red Dragon, and TNT.Some of my favorite KITCHEN items are: Udon Stir Fry Noodle Bowl (Chicken), Mongolian Noodle Bowl (Chicken), and the Dan Dan Noodle Bowl (Chicken). Their Bento boxes are also delicious, though too much food for me.I am also a fan of their boba teas. Some are a little too sweet for my taste (Strawberry/Honeydew) but they are good nonetheless.The best thing about this place is that it's fast and affordable while delivering food with amazing quality and flavor. The service, while not a ""sit and be waited on"" type of place, is always great and the faces are always smiling and willing to assit you. Now, you'll have to excuse me...I'm heading to Bento thanks to writing this review! (Seriously.)"
4/28/2014,2,"Bento is usually one of my favorite places. I used to go to the Gainesville location years ago and frequently visited the town center location. I was super excited to see them open up so close to work. However, my spicy tuna don was actually a spicy tuna and salmon don. I got takeout so this was a big disappointment. I hope they do better next time."
3/3/2013,5,Love this place. The thai curry is amazing and my son love their pot stickers. Everything is well prices and good portions. Doesn't hurt that they deliver with doorstep delivery either!
9/9/2010,4,"I love Bento!! and for the price it's perfect! the bubble teas are veery sweet and i have a sweet tooth myself but ..hey, maybe the ones i've ordered are sweeter than the rest.  i love their big menu selection of rolls, they're not like the best sushi rolls i've had in my life but i like it a lot and for the price it's even better. they have sushi happy hour M-F 3-6pm buy 2 rolls, get 1 free."
2/13/2013,2,"Not terrible but no point going back.  The food was okay but not a great value.  Small portions for the price, can't even remember anything special about the food.  Didn't love the kind of noisy trendy environment.  Felt like it was trying to be like a Moe's or a deli when you ordered but then like a cafe for seating.  Much better sushi and Asian food on the Southside, especially Crazy Sushi."
11/2/2013,5,Food was delicious. Staff was real friendly and helpful. Service was speedy and attentive. We've been dining here for 3 years and will continue dine with them.
12/10/2009,2,"I went to Bento for the first time on Wednesday at lunch with a friend. I wasn't expecting an order-up kind of place so when we walked in it was pretty crowded. The prices were reasonable for the portion size. The food was decent, typically what I would expect for an upscale fast-food order-up kind of place. My friend had sushi and a salad and she said she liked it. I wasn't very impressed by the looks of the Mexican roll. I had a tofu Bento box with szechuan sauce. The accompaniments were steamed rice, green beans, ginger salad and noodles. My dish was pretty tasty, but definitely nothing to write home about. I think I will go back and try the sushi for a better assessment on the place. Service was excellent! Very friendly staff and very attentive I must say."
2/28/2013,2,"Go elsewhere.this place is mediocre at best.  not the cleanest place.  the sushi is kind of blah.  service is a bit rushed.  i'd suggest wasabi over this place, if you want sushi in the town center."
11/16/2013,4,California roll was fresh. We both had the sweet and sour chicken. My wife in the bento box and I had it with noodles. Very good. The steamed dumplings came out last and were a bit cold. Very busy place. I was caught of guard by the stand in line and pay first way they do business. Overall it was very good.
10/2/2010,4,"Someone recommended Bento to me but I have to admit that I was apprehensive.  I just moved to Jacksonville from the DC area and the food in DC is hard to beat.  There aren't a lot of good Asian restaurants in my opinion.  But we went at my friend's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised.  It's very modern.  We were confused when we walked in because it's not a traditional restaurant.  You order at a counter, they give you a number and bring you your food.  The menu was neat because the entrees are customizable and there's a lot of variety.  It's a neat concept.  The food isn't to die for but it's good for the price and variety.  I'll definitely go back."
7/16/2015,3,I ordered the Florida roll and it good. The bento box I had was good. Not amazing but decent flavor. The prices are reasonable.
10/25/2009,3,Overall good food but too expensive. I love the boboa teas and will be back for those. Space is limited so grab a table as soon as you walk in. This place is definitely going to be one of my splurging venues to visit.
2/6/2013,4,Loved it and can't wait to come back. Unagi roll and shrimp tempura roll are yummy yummy. The fancy drink machine is pretty fun too!
5/28/2012,3,Kind of similar to Crispers...just with Asian food.
9/8/2015,5,Best sushi in town. Volcano roll excellent. Over all most of the rolls are really good. The only thing that I don't like is that you have to order before take a seat. The servers doesn't take orders
11/26/2015,3,"Sushi is ok, the hot food isn't good but we still go here from time to time because it's nearby and like the tuna/salmon dons. Best thing on the menu are the don bowls for sure."
3/10/2013,2,"I was craving sushi like a pregnant woman and I knew there was one in Jacksonville, FL. So I popped in and ordered a mexican roll, tuna tataki and pork dumplings. Ive eaten at the bento in Orlando so I thought this one is just as good. Well.... the mexican roll was blah, the rice was so packed and starchy it was hard to chew it, and the dumplings were gross. There was more  wonton wrapper than there was meat and the sauce was not good. The tuna tataki however was really good! Which was kind of shocking. But I wont go back just for tuna tataki."
8/2/2013,5,"The pork hops are very good. The only problem I had was the portion are not as filling as I thought. It was kind of small, I was still hungry after but it was tasty."
9/14/2012,3,"This place is a very large, fusion style walk up and order and they bring your food sushi/bubble tea/asian food place. The bubble tea is GREAT, the sushi, not so much. The asian food we had (chicken udon) was a-ok. We would return on another visit to Florida to try other menu items."
12/29/2011,4,"This is a pretty good restaurant. You could get the various dishes better in a restaurant that specialized in Japanese or Thai, but this place is still good."
1/2/2010,3,This is a pretty good lunch place.  I'd go back.  My wife and I each had a bento box and we split an order of sushi.  This place is cheap and the food was pretty good.  The staff was also very nice.
2/26/2011,5,"We live in St. Augustine and eat here whenever we have a chance. My husband hated curry until he tried my dish. Sushi is excellent.  Soup is good but will be luke warm unless you ask for it to be served hot. Very reasonably priced. Great atmosphere. Nice outdoor seating when I can convince my Mexican Chihuahua to eat Asian.  Kids get a real ""kick"" out of the cool machine that puts a plastic lid on your soda with Asian cartoon characters.  Cool Yogurt place next door for dessert."
7/29/2012,4,"Great lunch spot - I wish they had more room to sit, but that is a common problem in the area. The bowls of tuna with rice are fantastic. I also like bulgogi and rice."
2/6/2013,4,"I went here for the first time last night and it was pretty good. The set up seems efficient and for being busy, we sure did get our food fast. They have a cucumber avocado roll (best of both worlds, why don't more places do this?) and the veggie with the tofu on top was so good. I'd go back here again when I'm hungrier and try a bento box."
2/26/2011,5,"Great menu choices, fine preparation, and quality ingredients.  This Asian Fusion restaurant would charge a lot more in L.A,."
4/1/2011,4,I have been to one of these in another part of Florida and its a place I know I can go to and get consitently good sushi. They have an interesting menu and nice atmosphere. The sushi tasted very fresh to me.
10/15/2011,3,Nothing I have eaten here is terrible. It's a great place to go while shopping and don't want too much time sitting down for a meal.  It is Asian food for non-Asian food enthusiasts.  Nothing too spicy or pungent.  Great for kids too.
8/7/2013,5,"Our go-to place for fast, cheap, and last but certainly not least, GREAT sushi. Their sushi happy hour is awesome, so get your order in before 6!I recommend the spicy tuna don."
8/11/2011,1,"Walked in and looked at the menu.  Found something I wanted, but I wanted pork. For some reason they just could not make it w pork.  Didn't even bother eating. I work in a restaurant that bends over backwards to give whatever the customer wants, and they can't even make a simple substitution.  Won't get my business."
7/22/2012,4,"Modern, quick, and tasty! Good tofu. If eating clean ask for sauce on the side and order brown rice :p fresh veggies"
2/6/2013,5,Always a great experience at Bento. Love the Sushi happy hour and the coke freestyle machine.
4/16/2015,4,Great Japanese food with unique sushi rolls.  Never had a bad meal here.
7/7/2014,4,wanted some sushi so got online which is awesome and ordered up some sushi.. have never got sushi from this location but have from there other location and was always satisfied. . Got a good variety of rolls and everything was prepared very well and the taste was very good..would not hesitate to order again.
3/30/2015,5,Best sushi in Jacksonville. I love  the Mt Fuji roll and the bento boxes are great. We go at least once a week for lunch if possible
9/21/2010,4,"Compared to the numerous sushi restaurants around the Jacksonville area, this is a place I don't mind to frequent (for a place so rich in seafood, so many sushi shops in Jax just fall so short of quality sushi). I tried the TNT, dynamite, and spicy salmon roll most recently. All rolls came stuffed with generous whole pieces of fish. There was no overbearing amount of rice in/on the rolls that took away from the flavor or acted as filler to make the roll seem big. The best part of the spicy salmon was that it was actually SPICY without being slathered in spicy mayo. I barely used the soy sauce simply because I didn't want to detract from the taste of the sushi. I don't recall many or maybe any of the 'premium' rolls exceeding $10 and many included 10 pieces. I also got a mango milk tea with boba. Milk tea was a bit more creamy than expected and would have preferred a bit more mango but every place has a different way of doing boba tea. Either way, 4 stars for the great sushi."
2/27/2012,5,Total fan! Can't get enough. Great food and good service.
5/24/2012,5,Love the food and the tea.
8/5/2012,3,"For quick and dirty, it's pretty darn good. It's entirely unfair to compare Bento to a ""real"" sushi bar, or Korean BBQ, or anything else specializing in a more high-end version of a specific product, because Bento doesn't pretend to be any of that. It's kind of like the Pan-Asian Five Guys, so adjust your expectations accordingly. I wouldn't compare Five Guys to Holeman & Finch but I'm not going to stop eating it, either.The decor is clean and modern but it is NOISY - too many hard surfaces. I have a love/hate relationship with the drink machine because it is super fun but (a) it's always out of something that I want, and (b) everybody wants to play with it and/or slow folks just don't understand it, so there's frequently a line to get my beverage. If you are looking for something unusual, or a diet something besides Coke, you will be pleased. I've had the spicy tuna salad several times and I'm generally happy with it. The tuna is occasionally tougher than I would like, but not enough to make me angry. I would love a lettuce besides iceberg but that is what it is. The conch salad I wouldn't do again - tough and chewy and generally not at all what a lovely fresh conch should be. My chopsticks have wandered into a nearby chicken teriyaki noodle bowl once or twice and that seems pretty good, and the Bento boxes look lovely, though I've never been quick enough to snag anything off of that particular friend's plate. For a place to pop in while shopping, it'll do the job nicely - a head and shoulders above the ""food court"" Asian joints. It's a bit overpriced and you might have to wait for a seat if you go during peak times, but for a late lunch in a reasonable hurry it's a go-to for me. And on either Mondays or Tuesdays (one or the other - can't remember which), bring your receipt to Mochi's next door and get $1 off your fro-yo. Win!"
9/7/2011,1,I really liked this place and ate here a couple of times. Then I found hair in my food and got grossed out and have not been back. You might like it..... I dont think I will go back though.
2/29/2012,5,"Taro Milk Tea with Boba. Bestest. Ever. Nice, chill place to be at, too. Definitely will be going back at least every other day!"
8/6/2016,1,I don't normally give reviews but my experience at this place is horrible!!! The staff is so rude and need to learn how to have costumer service.  While I was waiting for me husband to order our food and so I went ahead and take a seat because we have young children but was told that I can't sit at a table unless we are done ordering when my husband was the third person in line which makes no sense at all. Either way we are paying to eat there and what's the big deal when there are tons of other seats available to everyone else.  If this is your rule then posted a sign in the front to notify everyone and also ask politely. I will not recommend any of my friends or family to tried out this place because it will just ruined your whole mood and the food is okay compare to others places that I have tried in Jax.  I will not be returning.  They need a better management personnel and some who cares to run a business and costumers service. It doesn't matter if you have good food but lack of customer service will drive people away. No food is good enough to be disrespected.
4/12/2016,1,food is ok. price is average but food turn out minimum. 1/2 rice/noodles in a bowl. well! u pay $10 for 1/2 bowl of noodles
12/14/2013,1,"I've been eating here since they opened. It was pretty good then but has been going downhill since. The portions are getting small. It has become dirty. The floor always has food and trash on it. Food is inconsistent,  especially the sushi rice is hit or miss. Today I gave it another try...there was hair and food and grease on the couch seat. Staff was no help in ordering for my wife who is gluten free. Bathroom is dirty always. Only one cash register open always when there's a lot of people working and line out the door for no reason.  My salmon don had lots of rice with very little chopped salmon in it. Very poor quality salmon, seemed like the leftovers. hardly worth the cost. Chkn teriyaki was dry and burnt......and we had three orders of it. I keep going back hoping things have changed and they keep getting worse. Like someone else who commented earlier, I have been to the Bento in Orlando on Sand Lake and it was great. This looks like a case of owner neglect or a struggling business cutting corners to save money."
1/30/2014,5,"I have tried many different Chinese (really, Americanized Chinese) restaurants, but Bento is one of the best I've ever been to!  The food was prepared relatively quickly (surely no McDonald's, but for the quality: the food was in front of me quickly).  The portions are great.  The menu set up is easy to understand; first you pick what kind of meal you want (the Bento box has more variety of food, but the rice bowl is more simple for those searching for more a more American-Chinese food experience), then you pick your meat (chicken, steak, tofu, pork).  I have been to this restaurant many times and never been disappointed with the food.Also, There is a sushi bar where you can actually watch a line of workers prepare sushi roll after sushi roll, keeps the kids (or you) entertained while waiting for food for a couple minutes.Also, the prices are very good too! $7.25 for a rice bowl which is enough of a meal for two!"
1/16/2010,1,Did not like.  Was very dissapointed sweet and sour chicken was soggy and drowning in bland sauce.
5/18/2014,1,"The first time here I was so excited!  The food was very good except that I couldn't get them to serve me a cup of hot green tea.  The first time they brought it, the tea was barely warm - I asked them to heat it up and it came back barely warmer.  The second and third visits were just frustrating.  I got barely warm soup and my mother tried to order a noodle dish she got the first time, ""Seafood Udon"" and they brought something out totally off the wall. We tried to tell the waitress 3 times it was the wrong dish, and she kept saying ""Oh, I'm just not saying it correctly"".  Finally, she took the soup back and it took 30 minutes for them to bring the correct dish. Today, we went there again, and again my mother ordered the ""Seafood Udon"" and we got something else.  I am done with this place.  Things you won't get here:  hot tea, hot soup or the entrée.  Also, no sweetener for those who like to get unsweetened tea and add it."
3/22/2011,4,"I am a fan.I eat here at least once a week, and I admit, it is more for the ambience than the food, but I have some favorites.  In the winter, I usually have the spicy seafood soup (thin noodles), but lately, I have been having the spicy korean beef bento box (I agree with other yelpers that it has far too many onions).  I also concur with most yelpers that the sushi is pretty average, but I am just happy Jacksonville finally has a place like this.  After living in cities like DC, Seattle, NY ...this reminds of the places I used to frequent when I was in college.  My kids love the stir fried udon, and my parents always find something they like (it is difficult to find a place that will please the palate of ""old school"" Asian grandparents, my husband and I and the kids!) .  A bit much to charge for ""extra sauces"", so we always decline these and use the soy or sriracha on the tables.   We all are glad to have boba tea (green tea lychee is my fave).  Service is fast and friendly.  When I am there, the sushi chef or the servers always stop by to ask me how I am doing or if I need anything.  We always head next door to mochi for dessert.  We try to go at ""non-peak"" times, which is a lot more pleasant because it tends to get crowded .  Kudos for nice outdoor seating, too.  A bit pricy for what you get, but as one yelper stated, it would be double the price in a city like LA or NYC for the same thing.  You can get out for under $10.00 for lunch.We go to Gainesville relatively frequently, and we eat at the Bento Cafe there, as well.  It is consistent in food quality and service also. Just the type of place I like to patronize regularly.  Modern, clean and cool atmosphere.  I would have liked it when I was in college, and I like it still now.  My kids always request it.  We count ourselves as fans."
3/19/2014,3,"The fish was fresh and tasted good. The pieces are small and cut very thin.  What I did not like is that you have to order before you sit down.  I understand the concept but having never been here before and the fact that they have 2 sizable menus makes it pretty ridiculous especially when the lighting did not make it easy to read and with people waiting behind you,  I never really got a good look at the menu and just ordered some of my standards.  They miss the mark on the concept with the size of the menu and the being  sort of forced to order before you are ready, also it is kind of  a wannabe hipster Sushi joint and they did not pull that off, but think it may have just opened so may get better.  That being said look at the menu online before you go.  I would probably have rated it higher if I would have had more of a chance to go over the menu and if the pieces would have been larger because it did taste fresh and was quality food but what I ordered was not worth the price, but you could eat here for less and get more if you know what to order."
3/5/2022,5,The food was absolutely delicious! First time eating there. I'll go again though! My order was a take-out and it was packaged very well. I'm very impressed.
8/8/2021,5,"So glad they've finally opened at the beach!  I've frequented other locations for years. Great option for something quick and healthy, and the sushi is always fresh. Highly recommend."
2/22/2022,4,I ordered take out from this spot last night and overall I was pleased. I called them to ask a few questions and make sure I could get my food with some modifications. The lady who answered was really nice and helpful. I had the stir fry veggie bento minus the onion and with the sweet soy sauce. I also had an order of the veggie spring rolls with the sweet chili sauce. Everything was quite tasty and the portion was large enough for two meals. It is fast casual so not my kind of place to dine in but their menu has lots of options and it seemed very clean. I will get take out again.
12/8/2022,1,Bad experience here. Staff could care less about being helpful. Looking at the food line they had stuff piled everywhere and looked very disorganized and unsanitary. This is a very weak attempt at fast casual  sushi and Asian food.
7/30/2021,5,I have been to Bento Asian Kitchen located at the town center a couple of times. I was in the Jax beach area this afternoon and decided to stop and grab lunch. If you've never had Bento I highly suggest getting the pao pao chicken. The flavor is very unique and unlike any other I have ever tasted. It's addicting! The white rice is super delicious as well. The serving size is more than enough for lunch and dinner. I also find that the rice bowls are very reasonably priced starting as low as $11. The inside of this location is very clean so I was super impressed with that. Great job Bento!
5/25/2022,4,Really nice ambiance and very clean. The sushi was way better than a lot of finer sushi houses. Had noodle and rice bowls. Generous servings and quite tasty.
12/4/2021,1,"If you're interested in distinctly mediocre pan-Asian menu with pretend sushi and plastic-textured over cooked stir-fry then you're in for a treat. If you like your food good and your front of house knowledgeable about the menu - then steer clear.  On the plus side, the place is clean and the young staff seem nice. Clearly it's poor management."
1/11/2022,3,"This bento is just like the other two in town. Food is descent, have been here a few visits and they really load up on rice on all rice dishes. This includes poke and sushi, where one would think it was a bit less. The edamame's are a family favorite though. All the garlic, yum. Service is good and quick just as the others. Bento is more expensive than other sushi places at the beach, or in general. Sushi rolls are on the more expensive side to be so small and tons of rice. However, we will still return as they are conveniently located to us and fast."
8/25/2021,4,Came here 30 minutes before closing after moving my daughter from New Orleans. The staff was friendly and quick with my order given I was this tired and hungry person coming in before they closed. Sushi was good but a bit more rice than my liking and great steamed dumplings. Great service and friendly staff.
1/2/2022,5,Very good! and the son is very friendly and thr food was good with generous portions! I will come back when visiting Jacksonville
10/1/2021,1,The food isn't take good. Bad service. Shushi is all rice over .need to make it better. Wasn't happy first visit.
3/14/2022,1,"Food was terrible tasteless unless you drown it in sauce, they give you a small amount of protein for the normal amount, missing a lot of inventory ... the employees are unmotivated and sluggish."
