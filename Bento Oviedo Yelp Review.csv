5/21/2021,5,"I was first introduce to Bento a long time ago in Gainesville and haven't been back to a Bento in forever.  I was working in Oviedo that night and decided to Doordash from Bento.  They were about to close soon and had to place my order soon.  Plenty of variety of items to choose from on their menu, but I knew I wanted a noodle bowl so I decided to get the Orange Chicken Noodle bowl with green, red bell pepper, and green beans.  Plenty of chicken in the bowl that was season well.  Everything tasted well together and didn't seem overly salty.  I would like to try other items on their menu next time.  Food came pretty quick and it was still hot. I will more than likely order food to go from here again."
10/5/2022,1,"Very poor experience when I ordered from here on Monday (10/3/22).  I did online order ahead to be picked up at 7:56.  I arrived at that time but didn't walk out the door until 20 minutes later.  The people who were in the store line to order sat and received their food prior to me.  The communication to me about my order was poor or nonexistence and nothing was said about me waiting there for that long.  We ordered 2 rice bowls, a side of Green beans ($6), and one sushi role.  One bowl i paid the extra to get extra chicken, which was not a noticeable upgrade at all.  It still felt like a small portion.  My opinion is these bowls have a lot of rice to seem make it a decent portion. This was a $46 order and I was not satisfied at all for what I got.  Not sure if i'll try again or not."
6/28/2021,4,I have not been to Bento in such a long time but man did I miss this place! I decided to get a Bento box with beef and I was so pleased with my meal. This meal is filling without stuffing you so that you feel terrible about yourself. I love that whatever you order is fresh made and I don't mind waiting a little bit more for that. While I waited I had a boba tea and you know what?? It was actually pretty good and that makes me so happy because you cant find a lot of places in Oviedo with boba tea these days :( Prices are great and I think overall this is always such a classic stop for anyone craving quick Asian.
10/15/2022,3,Ordered ahead. Didn't get my food till about 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready. Food definitely not worth what I paid. I ordered noodles and a couple other things and it came out to around 70$..... the noodles came with three shrimp. Three. For the whole dish. My family and I didn't think it was worth it at all. We even got soup. Cause you know who can mess that up.... We dumped it out. It was nasty. Needless to say not going back.
12/8/2021,4,"I had not been to Bento Asian Kitchen & Sushi previously, but stopped here on the recommendation of my son who had recently eaten here. The menu included a pretty Vince variety. I appreciate the range of options on the menu. While here you can order either an Asian kitchen dish, a poke' bowl, or sushi (rolls or bowls). I opted for a poke bowl; the Regular size includes 2 proteins and I selected Tempura shrimp and tuna over rice as a base. There are plenty of vegetable and topics to select from as well - all the usual suspects; asparagus, mushrooms, wonton chips, edamame, etc. There were a decent selection of sauces too, of which the staff was willing to provide a description of any I wasn't sure about. In the end, this was a nice poke bowl......This is a chain restaurant, and if I am being honest, I had lower expectations from them......but, they managed to provide a really good poke bowl that exceeds probably all of the the other chain places that I've tried. There are definitely a lot of Poke Bowl places in town to compete with and while they probably don;t top out several local small restaurants, they were definitely above average and worth a stop in. I'm interested in trying their sushi the next time I'm in as well. Everything I saw here looked tasty. The restaurant is easy to get to, it is right off of Alafaya/434 in Oviedo inside a shopping center; there is plenty of parting.....while there are several restaurants & shops in the center that tend to be busy, I've never had any trouble finding parking in this parking lot. Inside the restaurant it is a line/queue style ordering, then you either sit down with a # for them to bring it to you, or you wait for it as Togo (which is what I did). The inside of the restaurant seemed to have plenty of room, The tables were well spaced out so you are comfortably distanced and not interrupted by neighboring patrons if you were to eat-in. A good experience. Looking forward to trying more things on their menu."
1/7/2021,4,"I've been doing some places on the weekends, getting takeout and watching shows on Disney+, and this place ended up on Orlando Weekly's best poke list for 2020. So I decided to come here. It's only like a mile away from my apartment, very convenient. I got a poke salad with a couple of big hunks of friend salmon, some edamame, cucumber, grape tomatoes, mango, some crispy wontons, and maybe some other stuff. With a side of Tom Yum dressing. It was very good. The salmon was cooked well. And the other little sides were all welcome pairs to the salmon. A little sweet, a little crunch, a squirt of tomato. A nice, fresh little poke salad. I was a fan. I also got the Chicken Pad Thai (rice noodles, bean sprout, red bell pepper, egg, carrot, scallion, tangy peanut sauce). This was the far better dish. Very heavy, but that peanut sauce gave it the tang it needed to not just be a grease bomb in your belly. I got a couple of signature rolls, too.The Crunch (tuna, krab delite, cream cheese, avocado, spicy mayo, eel sauce, panko-fried). I'm not usually a fan of the deep fried rolls, but this one was not very oily. It was nice and warm and not overloaded with sauce, which is always a risk with these kind of rolls. I recommend you get this, if you have any concerns. And the TNT (flame-seared tuna, masago, spicy tuna, cucumber, scallion, spicy mayo, tempura flakes, togarashi). This roll had a very nice, big bite of fish. It tasted very fresh and there was Just enough mayo to add creaminess to the chewing, but not overpower everything. Garlic Edamame was good, Pork Dumplings were good.Overall, this place was good. If you live in Oviedo and are craving quick, relatively inexpensive food like this, go ahead and pop in. You won't be disappointed."
12/23/2020,5,"I haven't had Bento for the longest time, and they still don't disappoint! This time we got the poke and Mongolian chicken udon bowl for lazy Sunday night dinner, both were fresh made with excellence. They are one of my favorite poke places in Oviedo/UCF area, you get a lot of toppings/protein for a very competitive price! As for the Mongolian chicken, you can really taste the burnt oil smokiness from stir frying in the hot wok. This made it so lovely and is something impossible to copy at home. I will probably come back to Bento more often!Bento to me is not just a regular Asian fusion restaurant, it's also reminiscence and nostalgia of college days. When I tried Bento for the first time in Gainesville, where Bento was born, the small town broke college girl was surprised by the value/great combo you get for the Bento box (back then it was less than $10 for sushi, main entree, salad, rice, and a dessert). Alongside that, everything was really good! I kept on coming back, pretty much had everything on the menu by my sophomore year. And I'm sure many Gators share the same memories.With that said, I'm surprised to see how far Bento has come all these years. More shops, better/more modern decor, same taste and same food, a little pricier but that's also natural inflation. Now that I'm no longer a broke college girl and am surrounded by amazing food, sometimes I forget about Bento and not as appreciative anymore. I will definitely come back more often though!"
10/24/2020,5,Their new location is nice and never had their build a Poke. I must say I was surprised on how good and packed with protein it was. Everything was fresh and can't imagine how much bigger the large is. I had the spicy tuna and salmon and liked that it had more of a kick than other Poke known places.
12/25/2021,3,"Food is tasty, always has been. My issue is that this place used to have good food, good portions, and good value for money. Across the menus prices have gone up by $2-4 and now it's like $12 for a noodle bowl with chicken. Those are sit down restaurant prices... plus they removed the Masago add on from bowls ((probably to make them cheaper to make)). Disappointing :/ Probably won't be coming back, just no longer worth the price."
4/28/2022,4,"Good food, light on meat.  Pricey for what you get..  Eat there regularly and they are light on any of the meat.  Recommend ordering double portion of meat for any of their meals/bowls."
1/3/2021,4,"Thankfully, delivery is available in our area, due to COVID. Great food. Adorable little Bento Boxes for the kids. And the Boba Thai Tea was amazing! My favorite part."
11/20/2021,1,"3 strikes your out! We have been going to bento for many many years. When I found out they were building one in Oviedo I was very excited. Unfortunately every time we've gone it has not been anything Close to what the other two Bento restaurants taste like. The first and second time the sushi taste old. The ingredients were not fresh. This last third time we found hair in a sushi roll and as soon as I went to pour my son's noodle bowl there was a bug that came out with all of the noodles. I don't know what their doing differently at that store, but we will not return."
6/9/2021,5,Not many restaurants in the area offer this type of food.The sushi bento box offers a lot of sushi.
10/2/2021,2,First time eating there and ordered the Mongolian chicken and a boba tea.  The total amount came to over $19.00! Wow! I told myself that this better be off the chain for that price! Was disappointed by the portion and the food was Lukewarm.  Boba tea was bitter and served with a paper straw that stuck to  my lips when i tried to drink it. Price was way too expensive and mediocre food.
7/19/2020,1,"Bento is one of our favorite spots because the food is always good! Only reason I am giving a one star review is because of the customer service. We ordered our typical order and got this note attached to it stating that it is an additional charge for white sauce. There is no issue that they charge for the white sauce, would have just been nice to get a quick call saying that and we would have happily added some and paid for it. Just disappointing to get your food and be missing one of the best parts!"
10/21/2020,5,I had an awesome meal. The Zombie roll looked awesome and tasted great! I got some spring rolls and they tasted great. They weren't crispy at all but that happens when you get fried things in takeout. This was my second time and it won't be my last. The servers inside were friendly and helpful when I went in to get my food.
10/15/2020,4,Decent food - did take out twice (because of Covid). . . would not hesitate to order again.
6/10/2020,5,"Normally, this is the type of restaurant that I avoid like the plague, so I am almost embarrassed about how many times I have been here already since they opened the doors to their latest location.  For the life of me, I can never understand why so many times we see restaurant after restaurant featuring the same exact cuisine fail in the same location time and time again.  This spot has held several Sushi restaurants in the not too distant past.  I think what will help Bento succeed is their variety, cost and speed of service.  Each time I have ordered so far, the items have been ready in 15 minutes or less.  They have a good variety of rice and noodle bowls representing a number of Asian flavors.  The bowls have a good mix of protein, vegetables, carbs, and sauce.  I have tried Coconut Curry, Orange Chicken, Mongolian, Thai Pineapple Rice, and enjoyed them all.  The Egg Rolls were very good, and I have enjoyed all of the Sushi Rolls I have tried as well.  One thing I like about them is you can get a half or full roll for an order.  The Fried Avocado Roll has ended up in my bag 3 times already, and I am guessing it will again soon!  This is a great addition to the neighborhood for a quick, flavorful meal that won't break the bank."
6/8/2021,1,I have never been so disappointed with an order from bento in my entire life. I spent $20 for flavorless chicken and raw veggies. The only thing good was the sushi and there was wasabi accidentally sent it all over it. The waiter was also super confusing and had no idea what he was talking about or doing. Also waited 35 minutes for food that is below satisfactory. I got a bowl with chicken and udon noodles and the chicken is absolutely flavorless and the broccoli and carrots are not even fully cooked. Super disappointing for the money I paid.
6/19/2020,5,This food is amazing and* I miss good food (from SF). The service put up with me and they all wore masks - were super clean.  The pickup process was easy and super safe. The owner really put money into the community and I love the way the restaurant looks. Keep rocking Bento!
11/11/2020,5,"I stumbled on this little gem quite by accident, and I sure am glad!!  Haven't yet dined inside, but every week, it seems, I'm craving their food.  Ordering straight from their website is still delivered by Doordash, but you forego the ""service fee"" Doordash charges above the delivery fee.  Always arrives earlier than expected and perfect temperature!We have only had some of their sushi, soup, egg rolls and their bento boxes.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious.  Their boxes are a step above anyone else's.  They add a small salad, rice, green beans and those delicious little cinnamon sugar crispy noodles (there aren't enough of those, if you ask me!)Can't wait to dine in!"
10/11/2020,5,"This place gives big portions and everything i've tried is super good. The stir fry vegetable w chicken, the pad thai, the egg rolls, Orange Chicken, and sushi is very good."
4/21/2021,5,Love this place. Sushi box is my favorite with mountain fugi THE BEST!!!  They always served on time and never have problems with my orders. People are nice and have different options for the family with affordable prices.
8/11/2020,3,"I tried a sushi box which came with a California roll and 2 other 4 piece rolls of my choice. It also came with a salad and some noodles. The sushi is decent and seemed fresh but not the best I've had. The salad had no dressing and if I was supposed to choose one, that wasn't made clear as I told the server it was my first time there. I asked for extra wasabi, but received barely 1/4 teaspoon which was hardly enough. It was my first time there so I'll give them one more shot to see how they do."
3/8/2021,1,"Have eaten at this location a few times and while the wait is usually insane or they forget sauces, I got the Korean chicken rice bowl last night and woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pains. I continued to have pains all day today and have been postponing taking an exam because it hurt to sit up. After finally going to the bathroom and deciding to pull trigger, I managed to throw up about 10 times and finally got all the bento out of my system and instantly felt a thousand times better. I've only gotten food poisoning twice before this in my life so this meal probably ruined Bento for me for good."
9/3/2020,4,The poke bowls are amazing and the sushi is really good.  The staff at this location is very nice. Management is fair if you were to ever have any issues or questions.
9/17/2020,4,"Clean, friendly, good food at great prices. Love the brown rice vegetable options. Only wish they had curbside so I could swing by with the kids more often. Broccoli garlic is always a go to. Love the vegetarian sushi options"
8/11/2020,5,"Great food, Great service.... I had the beef Katsu with udon noodles and it left me wanting more! The workers were so kind even in this time of crisis. They not only had delicious food but it was all so fresh and such a wide variety of different umami flavors, I can not want to come back!"
3/13/2021,1,ordered rolls and they were cold and premade. they even admitted to premaking rolls. if i wanted premade rolls i would have gone to Publix. this place has gone down in quality.
6/6/2020,1,Had to wait 35 minutes for a basic order and the store wasnt busy at all. They also got my order wrong but I didn't bother because it probably would've taken another 30 minutes to get it right. The UCF location was much better. Wouldn't get food from this location ever again.
